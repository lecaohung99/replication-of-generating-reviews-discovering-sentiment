0,I regretted buying this item.I will never recommend this to anyone
1,This product does everything it said it would and more.
1,A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don't use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions.
1,"Alexa helps me fall asleep at night, tells me the time, weather, jokes, news and plays games with me. Alexa plays music too but I don't use it very often for that. I enjoy the ease of communicating with Alexa."
1,This tablet is very affordable but its well made. For 40 bucks this is a steal.
1,This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
1,"I did not know what to expect when I bought this, but after getting it home and experimenting, it was very helpful and my eight year old loves it. There are so many things Alexa can do, only limited by your imagination. We love it!"
1,"Best gift ever, now he leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now"
1,i am amused buy what i know of this and nowrealize much of what echo can do depends on how i research the resources and how much iinput information. the bluetooth possibilities are something i would like to know more of and how to use them.
1,I've not really been a reader in the past. I thought maybe I'd enjoy reading at the beach and so I tried my tablet. It blew. I couldn't see the screen. It had a glare. The Ereader has been great and I'm reading more than at the beach now. It works well. No issues. Wish it was waterproof/sandpfoof
1,"great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
1,i purchased the fire for my self to play games and surf the web. then my husband took my fire so i purchased one for him.
1,"I purchased this for my wife who had been reading e books on her Samsung tablet with the Kindle app. She reads 2-4 hours each day and had been having headaches and realized it was from the glare. I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite 3 and she absolutely love it. It's light, turns pages on a touch and the back lighting is adjustable. So far I have no complaints"
1,I enjoy reading my Kindle and also wanted the benefits of a tablet. Kindle Fire offers both options for me. It's not much heavier than my Kindle reader and the size is only slightly larger.
1,I bought the fire stick but wanted something a little bigger for my den with more storage. So I looked at the amazon tv and it was exactly what I wanted.
1,Set up is simple and more useful than I imagined. I added amazon music so I can listen to virtually anything I think of or Hear some new tunes.
1,Works great! Easy to setup and has great parental controls.
1,"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."
1,Simple to use and my kids pove it. Too bad the unit has so much Ad's
1,Used the product almost everyday and love the product
1,"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
1,"my wife surprised me with this, and I wasn't sure I needed it... after all, I have a smart phone, laptop, surface and a mini-tablet ... seems redundant, no?Long story short, none of those other devices are optimal in bright sunshine. This one is. it has more capabilities than I am sure I am using. need to learn to read magazines on it. but it works well, and especially outside."
1,Firebox is awesome! Would recommend to everyone. Great option.
1,"We had wanted an echo for quite awhile and when they went half price we couldn't resist, it synced right in with our other smart products without issue!!"
1,Highly impressed with my purchase. Allows me to use my iPad again since my 3 years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet. Great support and numerous educational apps for children!
1,"I used to read late at night with a bed light that kept my husband awake. After I started using the backlit Kindle Paperwhite my husband exclaimed, ""No more white nights!"""
1,"Im not a huge fan of the striped down android sytem. No google app store. But pretty powerful for the $35 I got it for. Plays movies , expandable memory, so-so speaker, and of course as far as e reading goes, it works."
1,Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less.
1,I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this Kindle. It is a good size and the price was right.
1,my daughter is girly so the fact that its pink is perfect! we take it everywhere with no fears of her breaking it when it drops and she stays entertained .
1,Voice recognition is nearly perfect! Quality and performance of the Echo is impeccable. WiFi connection and Alexa's connection to our Smart Devices is also great (much better than I had ever anticipated). Music is played all through Alexa which is convienent to the next level with great sound quality. We also have two Dots and a Tap; all highly recommended.
1,"Was attracted by the low price and bought this item spontaneously when strolling at a BestBuy store - perfect ereader / tablet, although an e-ink screen type is more pleasant for your eyes. Nevertheless for short readings it is OK."
1,This product is great and would buy for all my rooms in my home.
1,I am enjoying my echo and keep trying to find new uses for it. Having fun playing with all the features.
1,"It has some cool uses when it comes to books, music and home controls. However it needs better capability for voice control and command."
1,"I had an older Kindle and enjoyed it for many years. After I accidentally left it out in the rain, I was worried that I would not enjoy the newer versions as much as I had the old version. I was wrong. I absolutely love it! I enjoy reading outdoors and it's great to be able to read into the night - the fact that it is backlit is great!"
1,Bought for my son as a bridge between phone and computer. Fits in perfect
1,"great price, great screen and resolution, easy to use and good performance for less than $50."
1,"I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a ""kiddie"" tablet, as she calls them."
1,the tablet is very helpful when using the internet
1,Best that is out there at this time.would like if you were able to connect to Bose speaker with Bluetooth.
1,"Very easy to set up with an Amazon prime account. Haven't had to pay anything, great for small kids. Like the protective cover that goes on this device"
1,"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it."
1,"Good starter product for someone. If you use this a lot, the 8G is not big enough."
1,"Bought as iPad alternative for children 8 and 6 for reading and game play. Kids had iPad minis that both had charging port failures requiring costly repair/replacement. Easy to use, light weight and portable without the worry of significant replacement cost associated with iPad."
1,Black Friday buy for the family. Good entertainment for the kiddos
1,if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore
1,Its very user friendly for someone not good with computer at all.
1,"Can't beat the price and features on this tablet. All the features are competitive even with Amazon's proprietary operating system and appstore. Most common Google play apps are available, but if they're not, chances are there is something analogous. Navigation can be a little cumbersome as it isn't as customizable as some might like, but bottom line is, it's a pretty full feature tablet for fifty bucks."
1,Great tablet! Nice interface an button location. Will but again
1,great tab in low price and worth to spend. It has everything what i am looking for.
1,The Amazon Fire TV is an awesome system. We love it and use it every day!
1,Feels durable and battery lasts a long time! The screen is easy to read.
0,The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke
1,I bought this for my niece .It is user friendly and easy to carry. The features allow her to explore and use her imagination and of course the price was right.
1,"If you love the idea of having all your books in the same place, at all times. you should get an Amazon Fire. I purchased this tablet for my Fianc√© because he reads tons of books. Now he doesn't have to remember where his books are, because he can now have them at all times on one device!"
1,"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward."
1,No problems so far.
1,My only frustration is that you can't use a flash drive to view video or photos without purchasing a app that may or may not work. Other than that the product is awesome!
1,"In the past I have avoided tablets at such a low price point, and while I was skeptical of this one as well it has been a great purchase. I use it for tasks I would normally do on my phone such as web browsing, streaming videos, reading, and Android games. It performs all of these tasks admirably. Battery is great as well. I can get up to 7-8 hours depending on the task at hand. It is small enough to always have with me (typing this review on it now), yet large enough to give that real tablet feel as opposed to my phone. I have already purchased another for a friend. At this price you cannot go wrong!"
1,"Voice recognition works great. Wish Amazon had more sophisticated features available through this device. However, there's lots of innovation going on here. You won't be disappointed. The speaker is pretty good for something this size."
0,"An OK product. Bought on Black Friday for $35, you get what you pay for. Runs slow at times, good for simple tasks."
1,My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
1,We did not know it would cost so much to add the necessary extras to make this work the way we want.
1,5 star product would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get rid of cable
1,Got this to read on the train. Too Man ads. iPad only from now on.
1,"I bought one from BestBuy instead of buying one that is jail-broke. That is a moral choice for me. That being said, I can add the apps I want. The hardest part so far is getting used to not having a DVR and not being able to fast fwd through commercials...but I'm saving over $100/ month over cable, including the $40/month of apps that I'm currently buying."
1,"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
1,I bought this tablet for my grandson as a birthday present. You can set time a child use it and what your child can view on the Internet
1,Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
1,Plan to buy a second a second Amazon Kindle for a hi e year old.
1,Use for surfing and general use. Had for 2 mths works and operates great . Screen is clear
1,The setup and use of the Echo were quick and easy. My wife and son are having a lot of fun using it!
1,"Alexa is very responsive to questions, requests, and plays music. Also works as an alarm clock. And plays games."
1,We bought this for my Mother in law who isn't very tech savvy. She has no problems using
1,"Now that you don't have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it, its great. Have the original Echo, and the Dot also. Wish I had only bought two of these, the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go."
1,"Purchased for my wife, she loves it and was amazed at how easy it was to use after setup. Does everything as advertised and more."
1,I had brought this for my daughter and father.. They love it!!!
1,"Awesome speaker, love that I can talk to it and it responds well"
1,We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
0,"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well."
1,"My Fire is easy to use, lightweight, and small enough to carry in my purse."
1,"Wow, so impressed with this new kindle. Its replacing my 3rd generation kindle and its so much easier on my eyes. Also love the size, weight of the unit. Very pleased with this purchase."
1,Until now it look as a nice product.Just a bit expensive.
1,Cheap tablet that runs great and plays hearthstone silky smooth
1,"Although we haven't utilized any of the smart features (we will eventually), do enjoy asking questions and listening to music. Entertaining for the family"
1,Got for a 4 year old solely for games has enough memory for kid apps
1,Without a doubt the best bang for your buck amazon tablets are in the runnings for great tablets come in various sizes and definitely will give you apps to fill your every needs amazon hit a home run with price and value highly recomend!!!!!!!!! great for gifts. Dont forget black friday and Christmas will be here soon get your points rolling treat yourself to a tablet best buy will be more than willing to help !!!!!!!!!!
1,I AM GLAD I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS E A SECOND ONE FOR NEW YEARS!!
1,"this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I'm not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more."
1,We love this product and enjoy streaming movies and such.
0,Should of did a little more research. Do not like the ads on the start screen.
0,I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts
1,"This incredible ""gadget"" does so many things it's hard to quantify. Just ask for weather, news, music, traffic...you name it. Plus, lots of fun interacting. Will put a smile on your face!"
1,The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.
1,"Compact and very versatile, really very useful to keep things up to date"
1,We bought this to replace my children's aging Ipads and they're very happy.
1,I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
1,"Love the Echo, only wish the sound quality was a little better for music. As the contact point for your smart devices - 5 stars. As a speaker for music, 3 stars. Good, but not as good as the UE Boom."
1,"I bought this as a retirement gift for a friend. I love the size and weight of this kindle, as well as the ""paperwhite"" lighting."
1,"The Echo is quick to setup, easy to move around the house and outside to listen to music. I love my new friend Alexa and all the features that come with this product."
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter. She is 6 yrs old and loves it. it's easy to use and she can scroll between programs without problem,"
1,so i got this device to start setting up home automation. the first thing is that my kids love it. my wife gets to sing all her pandora songs. it also works great and sounds good.
1,Went from nook to Kindle . Love it. Awesome item. Love it
1,"Works great, excellent voice recognition, tells great jokes too."
1,I love my fire TV. I use it mainly for watching movies and TV shows. We also use it for Pandora listening to music. You can also side load applications that aren't available directly through the App Store. I cut the cable cord and haven't looked back!
1,Like it use it everyday. I have 3 grandchildren that live with me and they like playing on it too.
1,"I purchased both this and paperwhite, but it turns out I like it better than paperwhite even it cost me 20 bucks more."
1,The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.
1,"I would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. It is real easy to play games, Facebook and google."
1,"The Amazon Fire TV is a great choice. Voice operated system via remote with capabilities to download specific apps delegated to Fire, along with all the Android apps that are available on Google Play easily sideloaded. Sideloading is simple with the Apps 2 Fire app your phone sends your applications directly to the Fire TV wirelessly. As detailed this is an all around excellent Movie/TV/Music/Game System at the very least."
1,small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
0,"It is a great idea needs some improvement,lots of questions asked,its reply is I don't or can't answer that."
1,Seems ok but not what i really needed. I'm not much of a reader
1,"I was pretty hesitant at first when looking to purchase a Kindle. There is just something about having a physical book in your hands while reading and seeing the progress in how far you've gotten into the book. Being a person who is always reading on the go, at work, and in the dark at home when others are sleeping, the Kindle has been awesome."
1,I got this to give voice activation to a Phillips Hue
1,"I was in need of a new small speaker for music in the kitchen. The Echo has been a surprisingly awesome addition to my home. You know that best friend in college you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tapes you had ever seen? With my prime account through Amazon, I have spent countless hours playing music long forgotten. ""Amazon, play {insert artist here}..."" and I am reconnected to old music and exposed to new. I love asking Amazon about the weather while making my coffee. The sound quality is fantastic. There is so much that the Echo can do that I have yet to explore. I started using the grocery list this morning and feel like there is more and more to get out of my Echo. I will be buying an Echo for my folks soon- and my teenagers love it. 5 stars!"
1,Love the new light feature added. since 1st generation
1,"1st tablet,easy to use and set up.plenty of apps preloaded to start."
1,I cut the cable and my bill with ooma for phone is 84$ a month for triple play
1,Great for reading and relaxing on the eyes with no glare. Will not buy any paper back books anymore
1,Great device.=============================================
1,I purchased this as a gift for a family member. She recently used this on a week long vacation and enjoyed the long batter life during the plane trip. The reader was also easy to read in the sun while at the beach.
1,This is a tablet that's moderate priced with good results. Recommended highly for beginners or pre teens.
1,Great gift idea for kids. I would recommend the item.
1,"Useful for adults, educational and entertaining for children. Fun to explore all the things the Echo can do, from ""play easy jazz,"" to answering ""why isn't Pluto a planet?"" or ""take a note."" Something for everyone in the house."
1,"I purchased two Fires that were on sale. The quality, speed and display can't be beat for less than $50 by any other company. And having the ability to expand it's capacity with a Micro usb card is definitley a plus."
0,"Although I had a Roku three that did most of what I needed, Playstation Vue isn't available but it is available on the Fire TV. If you have a prime membership, this is probably for you. If you are one of the people that don't like me, this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them. You can't set the menu's to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded can't be put first on the list."
1,I bought this Kindle for my grandson and my son wanted one as well. They really enjoy using their Kindle's for all types of entertainment and downloading apps to play games. Keeps them entertained for hours. It was a great buy!
1,"I love my Kindle & bought this for my mother for Christmas, she is very hard to get for but I know she will like it for the simple reason she can enlarge the letters just so she can see without having to put her glasses on. That in it self will mean everything to her. Now, she should be able to read her magazines or books or look something up online without any issues. Love Kindles!!"
1,"The kindle was a graduation gift for our son who was going to travel with friends for a month. He usually fills his backpack with a ton of books, which he is reluctant to leave behind once read. This really lightened his load and he loved being able to read in all light conditions"
1,Exactly what I was looking for! Has most of the apps available that I wanted :) Very easy to use and set up.
1,Man. I was blown away with this. The voice recognition in fantastic. Answers almost all questions. Very helpful.
1,"I know there are other options out there, including the Fire Stick but this box is great. Doesn't lag at all, unlike my Apple TV (last generation though). I wanted to have a product based on Android for the goodies available and so far I'm liking it a lot, and it's 4K :)"
1,Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .
1,"Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more"
1,"I bought this for my wife and she loved it! We bought this specifically because it has no glare in the sun, tons of books through Amazon!"
1,Amazon - Echo - Black has come a long way from its roots as an online bookseller. Looking to branch into the Internet of Things the company released the Echo -- an internet-connected speaker that acts as a personal assistant.
1,We are really enjoying this product so glad we purchased it
1,"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
1,"I have an iPad that I read books on. Unfortunately it's horrible to read on the beach, park or anywhere outdoors in sunlight. The kindle paperwhite is perfect for that."
1,"I use it mostly for fun games, although I listen to books on it too."
1,I'm so glad I made this purchase. My Kindle is exactly what ive been looking for in an e-reader. Plus it's the perfect fit for my purse so I'm never without my favorite book.
0,Didn't like the return policy on this item. I couldn't purchase insurance on it in the store.
1,"Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
1,This is a smart buy! Wonderful for reading and watching movies. Perfect if you have Amazon Prime!
1,I was looking for an affordable tablet for my kid. This was a great buy.
1,edge could be wider to make it easier to hold. other then that a very good product.
1,This works great. It is a great way to get rid of cable.
1,I love this tablet so much that I bought 7 of then for my family so they can have there
1,Great product and I'm in the process of cutting my cable tv.
1,"I got this to go along with the Vizio P65-C1 I bought. The Vizio is a great display, but with no internal tuner. It must be connected to cable or a streaming/casting source for programing, The Fire TV makes it easy to connect to Netflix and Hulu, among many other program sources. But, it's especially great if you're a Prime member, giving you access to Prime Video, both free and purchased. The only think I'd change is if it could receive HDR programs/movies. Amazon Video does have HDR programming available for a growing amount of its content, but this version of Fire TV does not. If you don't have a UHD TV, Fire TV is about perfect."
1,Bought this for my godmother. She loves it to pieces.
1,Got this item to watch movies.... has Netflix and most other places to watch movies and tv shows
1,I have this tablet and liked it so much I purchased another as a gift. It was easy to set up and use. She loved it.
1,"I've had Amazon Kindles since v1. Each new release surpasses the one before it, as you would expect, but does so in ways that always improve the user experience. I love the feel of this one - great size, great weight, and I love the backlit screen."
1,"This is a great buy for what you get. We always buy the low price great quality tablet, Amazon fire, and then get a micro memory card and upgrade the memory so they can download tons of games and videos. I highly recommend this tablet"
1,purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law. he loved it and works well. great sound and loves the portability of the unit.
1,My six year old turned this tablet on immediately on Christmas Day. He knew how to operate it easily.
1,"Great design, decent remote, 4k support, tons of app support, ethernet support, I love it!"
1,"Great tablet, easy to use. I used to carry a laptop when traveling, now this does everything I need."
1,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."
1,Bought for my wife as a replacement for a Fire purchased a few years ago. She likes this better
1,"got this for mom since she has bad wifi , wired is the way"
1,"The 8 inch Fire is s great reader, 5 star. The only down side are limited add on applications."
1,"Great little tablet, fast, does a lot but does not do it all. Missing Google Play Store and screen is only ok. Price cannot be beaten"
1,"This tablet gets the job done! It is a 50 dollar tablet, so know it is limited in what it can do. It does what I purchased it to do. Basically read email, watch videos and to do social media. You shouldn't compare it to a higher end tablet. NOT the same! You'll have no complaints if you know going into purchasing, you get what the price reflects!"
1,This works a lot faster than a fire stick love the product
1,"The Echo is absolutely amazing, I have it controlling so many things in my house! And all tied to my iPhone"
1,Great addition to the family room. Movies on demand and very smooth streaming!
1,"I have one and my mother liked mine so I got her one she loves being able to check her email, go on the web, and play games."
1,Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it.
0,This tablet is great for minimal use for a child. It is slow so I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.
1,"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100"
1,It is a nice convenient tablet for carrying around.
1,I used this charger right away and my Kindle is up and running. I like the compact size.
1,"I love my fire stick movies , music, even movies that just came out are all free wow this is the best Valentines Gift ever and for all ages to enjoy so get yours today"
1,i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read
1,"Good this is an excellent tablet, I will recommend it"
1,"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve."
1,upgraded from prior models and like all new features
1,Very light to carry and easy to read in all light situations. The battery life makes it great for when you are on the road.
1,"I like this Kindle paperwork, it works good and relative cheap."
1,"After being really hesitant on switching from hard copy books to a kindle I decided to go for it. Ever since I've used it I have loved it simplicity and how adapting it can be to light. Still love paper copied books, but kindle versions are much simpler."
1,"I seem to enjoy this in most catagories. Wasn't sure about the tall and narrow screen layout at first with reading books, but when placed side by side with old ereader, no strain to learn new layout. Only thing not happy about is the lack of under $10 cases. Not wanting to spend $25 and up for a $49 unit. I'm sure that will change. This is a real good product in a usually subpar price point. I think this will be a game changer."
1,"I already have a Kindle Paperwhite, which I don't leave home without. I now have my husband hooked on the Fire 7"". I have used it a little, but it it primarily his. He really likes it. Easy to use. Nice large display."
0,"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
1,"My family loves our Amazon Echo and Alexa. She is used mostly for playing just about any song available, as well as weather reports, creating shopping and ToDo lists, and learning bits of trivia too."
1,Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
1,"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
1,"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android."
1,I bought the tablet for my one year old son so we can use it in the car. It just a great buy. I recommend it to anyone that has young kids.
1,"So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine."
1,"I purchased 3 of these on the BLACK FRIDAY sale ($34.99 each) and received them in 2 days! Had to wait until Christmas to have them opened by my kids to see their potential. Great tablet and features (especially kid mode) but have only one complaint so far.....one of the tablets had a BAD DIGITIZER right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet. Hence only giving this item a 4 star rating as this issue should NEVER happen right out of the package. However Bestbuy is doing everything to make sure I'm a happy customer by ""price matching"" when the item is available (completely sold out everywhere). Other than that issue this tablet is user friendly, fast processing/web browsing, decent battery life and great WiFi connection (doesn't drop signal like other tablets). Would recommend!"
1,Great tablet I love it and does what I wanted to do and that's it
1,"Could not be happier with this purchase. The voice activated command button on the remote works fantastic. If you do not have a smart TV, highly recommend this device. It buffers for maybe 5 seconds to start a show and then displays perfectly."
1,"Like it its very easy to understand,clear to read,easy to access to the websites."
1,Product is great. Highly recommended and extremely easy to all around the house/office.
1,Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.

1,"purchased this for grandson, great price easy out of the box. awesome price had some leftover for a case an essential part for a 7 year old :)"
1,Good tablet for twin boys four yrs old. Don't have to worry about them dropping it too much. Easy set up.Would recommend.
1,Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
0,This tablet is okay however the screen is too small and the WiFi does not work well. The WiFi turns off and I have to manually reset it over and over. The camera is nice however the resolution is not sharp enough for my needs. Does not make sense why there is not a version without cameras with a bigger screen size.
1,Got this for my pre teen who took to it like a duck to water. It is great size and easy to pack
1,I started with a basic kindle four years ago After two years I purchased the kindle Fire HDX. I have been very satisfied with it. Now I also have the new kindle fire. So when one is charging I can use the other device
1,"What can I say, it saves you money. It's a no brainer. Destroys the any other media streamer on the planet. Put your dollars into this device if you want quality."
1,My grandsons are very entertained with the tablets.
1,Purchased these for Christmas gifts. Assuming they were satisfactory because I didn't hear of need for returning. Purchased as angel tree gifts for preteens.
1,"She's always there to answer a question, and the integration with other home automation systems is great. We just tell the house what to do and she does it :)"
1,Bought it for a 2 year old and she loves it. The only thing she uses it for is YouTube videos
1,"I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She is constantly reading, but was using her cell phone.So glad I got this for her. What a difference! Free shipping and super fast delivery."
1,4k capable .....memory expandable...faster than firestick....perfect...
1,Of you're looking for a tablet with all the bells and whistles this may not be for you. If your looking for a great reader with easy access to all Amazon has to offer at an affordable price this may be what you're looking for.
1,This Kindle Paperwhite makes it so easy to read ebooks in several different file formats. I use it every day and am very satisfied with this purchase.
1,"Bought this for my wife on her Birthday, she loves it."
0,Great for a first tablet. Needed something larger than my phone and it comes in handy when the grandkids visit.
1,Love it. Works great. Need good wifi signal. Easy to set up.
1,"I bought this for my 9 year old and it is perfect for reading books and playing games. My only disappointment is with kindle because if I put him as I child under my account he has access to my books, which I do not want to happen. I had to create an account just for him."
1,Was holding out til the price drop. Got it for $33 on Friday after thanksgiving. Love the tablet great for my little girl.
0,It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
1,"Absolutely love Alexa! Great sound quality and very easy to use. Love being able to just ask her questions and she can quickly answer. Also, fun to play games"
1,BOUGHT FOR MY KIDS!!! THEY LOVE IT!! WORKS WELL!!!
1,"Love, love love it! Great for turning your tv into a smart tv!"
1,Thus was purchased as a gift for a friend. Don't know how well it works.n
1,This is great if you need a bigger screen than your phone when you're commuting to and from work on the train or wherever you go
1,Salesperson did a good job recommending this item after we explained what we would use it for.
0,Enjoying it not so easy to setup but once you get it all is good
1,Very happy with the firestick. Does everything that I expected.
1,Good screen resolution. Keep wifi off and adjust brightness for best battery life.
1,"I was hesitant at first to purchase the echo bec of my experience with the Apple Siri. But I asked around from people who has it and I got good reviews. Alexa is always there to answer me, quick response and could understand even people with accent.Great product specially at the price I got.."
1,Purchased for kids. It is easy for them to use it. They love the apps. Great parental controls.
1,"Smart Amazon Echo I am enjoying having theses Amazon Echo, my life much more easy then before. Excellent Amazon Echo....!"
1,"Never thought I would enjoy reading again because reading a boundbook made my eyes to tired to finish one. With the Voyage, I don't get that feeling."
1,"Great speakers and helpful turning lights off and on when I can't get up to do so. Also, I like that I can tell Alexa to play old time radio and Spotify."
1,I am very happy with this purchase. The price and quality of the product is very good.
1,It works wonders it gets the job done for a cheap one it's really not bad at all for the price
0,Good tablet to purchase for a first time tablet user.
1,Set up was fast and easy so many uses for this product. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,"This tablet is great! Unfortunately got a defective one at first, but Best Buy was happy to exchange it for us and had no problem doing it! I'm sure it was only defective due to the hundreds of people who were there on black friday shopping! Works great! Very satisfied!"
1,"I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy."
1,The Amazon Echo is nothing short of amazing. A must have for anyone that listens to a lot of music and wants the ease of selecting songs!
1,This is an incredible product. I would much rather read on this than my iPad!
1,Bought as gifts for my parents. Good tablet for introducing them to smart devices.
1,This fit my price range perfectly so that is why I bought it. Works as expected.
1,Easy to use with all the functionality she needs. Perfect size for her little hands
1,"My son absolutely loved the 7"" tablet. Wasn't too big or small. Perfect!"
1,Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
1,"i bought this for my niece and she seems to love. It was easy to set up, but a little different to navigate from other android devices. she mainly uses it for netflix, but sometimes i catch my sister player finding nemo on it."
1,by far the best streaming box out there i loved the first one too but all the new stuff on this one is wow 4 times faster and better wifi cant go wrong love it if you aint got one go get it this is rhe game changer !
1,This is the 2nd fire tablet ive purchased. The first was for my daughter ans she
1,This was bought as a Christmas present for my other half. She is enjoying it very much and it is user friendly
1,This was a Christmas present for our child and it was exactly what we expected.
1,My son loves his kindle. It is a great device. Our only problem is switching from internal memory to the memory card we put in it. It's not as easy to do as I would like.
0,Its a beginner tablet. Not so great interface. I prefer larger size tablet
1,I'm glad I chose the kindle with lighting. I use it often in bed. No regrets here.
1,"Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can't wait until he opens it"
1,"I love Alexa! Sure she is just my play thing but, much to my surprise, she has been more useful and efficient than I thought she would be. The Alexa app coupled with Alexa herself and I can keep my day organized, informed, and on track. I'm thinking about buying one for upstairs as well...."
1,Simple to set up and use. This is the second Fire 7 inch I have purchased. First one was for Mother-In-Law for Christmas. She loves to read and this tablet works great for her. I use this one mainly to play music through blue tooth speaker on deck. Battery life is very good. Also Grand kids love to play games on it.
1,My granddaughter loves this tablet. It's the perfect gift for a 2 year old
1,very easy to use. this is just perfect size to carry with me
1,tablet is good for older kids with added boundaries
1,"I was hesitant to buy the Echo, but waited until it was on sale. It's great for music and ties to Amazon Prime or Bluetooth to your phone. Unfortunately, it needs to be plugged in at all times to be powered on."
1,"The Echo was a great purchase. As a whole, we ordered groceries, batteries and everything else just buy asking Alexa. The deals of the day are fantastic as well, just ask Alexa what the deal of the day is!"
1,I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal!
1,This new kindle is smaller than the large one I had. It is made for easy reading. Definitely very happy with this updated version
1,"I bought my wife the fire when they first came out a couple of years ago. She found it difficult to use and passed it onto our youngest son. He showed her all the features and when the latest fire came out, he bought one, showed us all it had to offer, she bought me one for Father's Day, and then she bought herself one. My son helped us set it up and showed us how to use all the featured it offered. We love it. We take it everywhere, especially in our travels. It is offered at a great price and I purchased two more for Christmas gifts along with the cases...Love them."
1,I have been looking for an e-reader with backlight so that I could read under low light conditions. This Kindle has met my needs.
1,One of the best new products today. It is like a assistant to answer all your questions.
1,Comes in handy when staying at hotels you can connect and find your shows.
1,"I love that this guy supports 4K content since I just recently bought a 4K TV. Please be aware that if you don't already have an Amazon account, you'll have to set one up before using it. You can set it up through the Fire TV, but It'd be best if you just do it through a computer because the process to set up the account through the device I tedious and frustrating at times."
0,replacement for broken screen tablet on grandson's tablet...he's happy
1,"This is the center of my home theater system. Plays music, movies and anything else you throw at it. Excellent!"
1,Got this for my 6 year old. She really enjoys it for playing games. Pretty good built-in security features
1,Should be included with the Kindle.
1,"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it‚Äôs not cable. I miss cable, but I don‚Äôt miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer."
0,"The paperwhite was excellent at first but just yesterday (Feb. 22), less than 2 months since I purchased it, it froze and nothing I do will work. I am taking it back to Best Buy and hope they can fix it."
1,Awesome media device. Great option for those looking to get rid of cable.
1,This tablet was perfect for my 10 year old. She bought it with her own money because it was so affortable.
1,"The tablet was on a great deal for black friday. I purchased it just for reading books and lightly going online. I am not expecting amazing power from something so cheap, I dig it for what it can do and not for what I think it should do."
1,We have this and the echo. We love them. My grandchildren have fun asking questions
1,Love this product. Been thinking about purchasing this for quite a while and very happy I finally did
1,"I love it from the first moment, would love to be more intercative."
0,"the internet server SILK is not compatible with free wifi on southwest airlines and I bought it to use on the plane. also I cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane. so I don't really need it since I have a computer , iPhone and kindle at home."
1,Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
1,the recipient of this gift was very happy to receive it. worked great
1,"Bought this for my Granddaughter, she absolutely loves it!"
1,Good Quality tablet but the only drawback is that you cannot download every app that a normal android user wants!!
1,Easy to set up and use. Good volume and pre loaded lists. Seems to have good range and can be used in a large area.
1,Love this gadget!!! I highly recommend it!!! Easy to set up too :)
1,This is great tablet for anyone. It's an adriod tablet so it's different than the iPad features
1,"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
1,Like the product but haven't utilized it enough yet for home automation.
1,"Bought for our child who has vision issues but LOVES to read. ‚ù§ She can borrow library books and they return ""automatically"". Appreciate that the screen lighting is more gentle than other tablet items. Grateful for no game options. Wish I could control the ads better! That's my only complaint. Some advertised books are plain wrong for a young one but there it is with a sample or picture. Just gotta keep an eye on that."
1,I am very pleased that I was able to purchase this as a gift for my daughter
1,Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
1,Loving it so far. Easy to use considering I'm not super tech savvy.
1,Tablet could use a better speaker otherwise a great tablet
1,"Did a lot of research before deciding on the Amazon Fire. I actually bought a Roku which had a user friendly interface, but ultimately settled on this device since there seems to be more apps available. Good connectivity and ability to extend memory another plus."
1,Purchased as a gift for my mothers birthday she will not put it down. She exclaimed how easy it was to pack for her trip last month and she said she can read it even when all the lights are off. She wonders how she has lived without one all this time and would highly recommend it to everyone.
1,Good product to have for your family entertainment.
1,so far daughter really likes it and it alexa sang her Happy Birthday! had no problem with getting it started either.
1,Still to new to review but have high hopes for it.
1,"Amazon Echo is a great product. Gives you information (news, music, restaurants...), turns on appliances, lights and more. Highly recommended for the techie in your family."
1,Continuous updates make the echo up to date always.
1,It's my family's third kindle device. Very convenient for reading although my daughter wants to read paper books after using her own kindle for 2 years.
1,I bought this for my three-year-old and he loves it
1,"Very user friendly product. 100 times better than Siri. Play music from Prime music. If you have a Amazon Prime account, I would recommend you to try this product."
1,The Amazon echo is really amazing. It makes everything easy and friendly to use.
1,"Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games."
0,"I purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new Playstation Vue service which it did run pretty well. It does everything they say it does but one of the main issues I had with the original and still have with this is the interface. The layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous. After using Roku for years, the Nvidia Shield TV, and the new Apple TV I would recommend any of those over this device any day. They offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part (except playstation vue)."
1,Good for the price. Expandable memory. Laggy at times.
1,easy to read and great resolution. will probably get another for a family member
1,"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
1,Since my apartment is paired with Echos and Echo Dots the Fire TV was a must have for my place. Not as sexy as an Apple TV but its UHD capability paired with my TVs made this a great addition.
1,"I have 3 dots and kinda stayed away from the echo, because seriously its the same thing except with a giant speaker. However I was super super wrong with how useful that giant speaker is, for one this thing is loud. At 10 I can hear it at the other side of a 2 story 3500 sq ft house. (like its next to me practically) The quality is incredible and the voice detection on it is awesome. Best purchase of the year!"
1,We recently bought all our grandkids a tablet to have of their own.. great tablet to play games on and educational things as well.
1,this device has been a wonderful addition to our home the sound quality on this device is amazing
1,"I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance."
1,"The speakers on the echo give great output. this smart technology is fun, and I am learning new things that it does every day"
1,"Easy to use. Bought this for our grandson, he loves it!"
1,Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
1,"I already have a Kindle, and a tablet, but I wanted something smaller to take when traveling to download movies to. This is perfect! Good price, and the color and clarity is perfect!"
1,"Very good quality and easy to use, you can read anytime!"
1,This device is small and compact and super light. The words really stand out and looks like a real book.
1,"I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music."
1,This a a great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate!
1,Bought for my GF and she literally has not put it down since she received it. She was optimistic at first but now loves it.
1,Item was a replacement for an earlier version whose battery was declining / not holding charge. Replacement was more cost effective than battery replacement. An added bonus is the fact the the newer device is faster.
1,This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..
1,"It's very useful device, so easy to deal with. The Pandora radio can play whatever I want!"
1,"We bought this for our 3 year old because she enjoys playing games on my IPad. This is a much cheaper alternative should she drop it. Android apps so she can get most of the same games and apps. Timer apps available so I haven't checked to see if you can limit time on the device itself. Bonus is the size, it is perfect for her."
1,"I bought an echo, tap and dot..... doing it over again, I would buy 2 taps. Sound from the echo is slightly better than the tap, but I LOVE the portability of the tap at 30% less. Cant go wrong with either echo or tap."
1,"..who is an Ô£ø fanboy, and now he will more than likely trash this when the HomePod arrives.. yay Ô£ø .."
1,I was going to buy Roku 3 but the team member suggested buying Fire TV instead. I'm glad I did cause you can get Kodi on this and it's still got HBO and Netflix. Works great!
1,"much faster than previous model, screen is super crisp and readable. No jaggies on the text."
1,"I have never owned a Kindle and was using the Kindle ap for iPad for the last several years. This little device is remarkable. The page is crisp and clear, the navigation is so easy. Purchases are simple and straight forward. I love it!"
1,I have bought 6 Amazon fire tvs in the past and they are far better than chromecast and apple tv in terms of simplicity and volume. I highly recommend them.
1,Good adorable tablet. Don't have a bad thing to say about it. As long as you purchase a micro SD there is no issue with storage.
1,"I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it."
1,Great product for the price. Has everything my child needed. I recommend it for starters
1,"Easy to use, love the color and my daughter loves it. Easy to set up very happy with my purchase."
1,"I don't jump on the electronic bandwagon when new things come out, but this thing fascinates me."
1,I like my kindle and got it at great price.I would recommend it to someone and it's kid friendly as well so it's great to read books.
1,"Bought the Kindle Paperwhite as a gift for a friend. He loves it and uses it daily. It's great for reading outside during the day, even in the South Florida sun, and the adjustable lighting is great for reading at night or in dim lighting."
1,"Keep up the good work, works fine with smart lights"
1,"Love this device, long battery life, very useful, great for on the go lifestyles, love the backlight and the overall clarity"
1,"Cost is not outrageous. Easy setup, fun to use and syncs with my iPhone Bluetooth. Practical uses for home as well."
1,Purchased this for a Christmas gift for my nephew. He loved it. Very nice tablet at an affordable price.
1,I have a couple kindle fires myself. I loved them and she was looking for a reader. So I got her this kindle fire. She loves it.
1,I love Alexa it's fun to use and so convenience. I use it as a timer when I'm cooking. Ask it to play music. Even my kids like it. Great product!
1,My sons love playing on their tablet. Not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided.
0,This product is fast a stylish. Good battery life. Helps to be a regular Amazon client.
1,"very fast tv stream, netlfix is super fast and good quality"
1,I bought this for my youngest to read and play. Awesome!
1,"This tablet is great especially for a child. Granddaughter is responsible but accidents do happen so I didn't want to buy her an iPad till I saw how she did with this. After playing with her fire and being able to download so many free games, she informed me that she does not need an iPad. Needless to say she is very happy and so am I. I like that I could buy the smaller gb one since you can add an sd card to it, to increase the storage. This is really a great purchase."
1,"Me and my family we love amazon fire tv.You can find any tv show,movies ,all kind of streaming apps.some paid some free."
1,It was a great gift for daughter in law. She loves it.
0,"Cool device but not totally useful as internet tool completely...but do use it for several helpful tasks, music, alarms and weather updates"
1,"The Amazon Fire works terrific! It great for emailing, social networking and web browsing. I can even play a few games on it too. Battery life is really great too. I recommend this to everyone!"
1,"Helpful, learned a lot. Gave good information. Good comparison"
1,"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up."
1,This has been an exceptional hit for us she totally loves it.
0,The plug in part of the charger is fine BUT cord could certainly be longer.
1,I have been missing out on reading books. This kindle is perfect. My wonderful husband gave this to me for my birthday. What a wonderful surprise.
1,This is a well made tablet that has many great features.
1,...browse. Buy a good case as this might slip thru your hands and fall.
1,"I purchased this tablet as a gift for my mother. It doesn't have the drills of some other tablets, but it meets the basic needs she was looking for."
1,a gift. He LOVES it. was a reasonable price. thks.
1,love alexa it is so unique I am enjoying it tremendous
1,this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
0,Overpriced and should be FREE with Kindle Purchase
1,I have purchased this item for 3 grandkids to date. Exactly does what it needs to do.
1,"Alexa works good for the controls and ways that I am using the system. Using to control some home automation (lights, thermostat, etc)."
1,"I bought this kindle paperwhite for my wife, she has a kindle and she likes to read at night, this paperwhite has a light so you can read anytime. She really loves it."
0,The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
0,"I purchased this item on sale as an alternative tab to android RC tablet. Fire tab is extremely slow, my son had been using RC tablet without any problem, but this one is slow, takes forever the web page to load, apps are also slow. Absolutely waste of money."
1,amazon fir is absolutely the best for streaming movies
1,A great addition to my fledgling smart home. I can hardly wait to see what Alexa can do next!
0,"It's a good tablet, mainly because I order so much off amazon"
1,Like it very much. Enjoy using it. The whole family participates and has fun.
1,Read Kindle books daily and had been utilizing my iPhone and IPad to read but neither of these are conducive to reading in the sunlight. SO I bought myself an early Christmas present and love the ease of use and the ability to read while outside in the bright sunlight. Worth every penny!!!
1,"I have amazon prime and you really get a value out of this tablet if u have the prime. Reading books is good with it, browsing web, video play, music, casual games, good battery life. Only thing thats not so good are cameras ."
1,Love the kindle fire.This is the eighth in my family
0,"I had to buy it, what else is there to say."
1,Bought this with a dot and we love these. So easy to play music and set alarms and other cool things this does. Love this and highly recommend for house
1,"The Paperwhite is a terrific e-reader. The text is clear, the backlighting easy on the highs, and if course has a huge selection of books."
1,"Great tablet, great price, wifi has great range compared to apple products"
1,Simple to use and great for a child's first electronic
0,"Overall for an Alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones. This one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activated (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apps better."
1,Bought for younger daughter and loves playing games on it.
1,"Better than I even thought it would be. Such a great purchase, I bought one for my parents."
1,"The biggest drawbacks to this product is the lack of any instructions/user manuals included with the package. You are forced to experiment with the controls to boot it up and start using it........if you are adventurous and PC oriented, it's no problem.........if you aren't.......good luck."
1,"Simple tablets and I get along great! I don't want to spend the big buck to get someting that a much cheaper alternative will handle just as well. Gave my much older tablet to a child, who was overjoyed, and updated version for me."
1,I have been trying to cut the cord on cable/dish for a while now. This definitely makes it much easier and I'm saving a few bucks. However it does have some glitches. Every once and while it will freeze but it is very uncommon and could be my internet and not the box. I can't dock it too many stars. Would still recommend.
1,The Amazon FireTV is an easy to install device. You can view so much content; and the apps are a plus. Become an Amazon Prime member and you will enjoy much more content.
1,"I bought the fire tv for using my Sling TV subscription. It works great but the only thing I don't like about this product is we cannot install apps from external sources, I tried to install an external app which worked fine for 2 days and stopped working later giving me message that the app was not installed from Amazon app store."
1,Yhis tablet is great for the price. You could do almost anything another table can do for that's 5x the price.
1,Easy to use. Great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.
1,"Use my echo daily. Easy to set up and use. Great for background music, weather and traffic in the morning."
1,My 10 year old granddaughter loves to read. She can now download books from the local library as wall as other websites. This is a wonderful tool for a child that loves to read
1,"Not my favorite tablet. Its good for the price, but its function is limited."
1,I bought this tablet on Black Friday for an awesome price. Could beat the price for a quality tablet
0,"Alexa can do basic things, hard to find tune skills"
1,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.
1,"I enjoyed the way the Fire 10 transfered all of my books, games and apps. It only took a little bit of time to go through the start up. The Fire starts up quick and I love the larger screen for reading my books. The colors are brilliant."
1,"We all really like Alexa, especially when cooking you just ask her a question without having to get your phone out. Music is great to listen to also"
1,"The experience of reading on this device is not the same, you should try. Quality is awesome and light adjustment as well."
1,I purchased this item thinking it would show a higher quality in picture than the firestick but it does not in my opinion. Only difference it has more storage.
1,this kindle is absolutely awesome! it has a great reading light on there and is easy to use. i would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an e-book reader.
1,"The screen is adequate and the service is reliable. I did not play with it much due to it being a gift. Sadly the person it was purchased for was unable to hold onto it long enough to use it (elderly lady). I still have it though, and it's a great little backup to my primary tablet."
1,"Great price for the fire, my other fire stopped working after 4 years, I logged into amazon, and it updated the new one with all my apps"
1,"I knew about this from its crowd funding start and wish I had jumped on board then. This is an excellent platform to start home automation and the entertainment value is a welcome bonus! Even my 88 year old mother-in-law can use it! The sound quality is great and the listening range is amazing. I can tell Alexa to turn off a connected light upstairs from upstairs.Note, it does not work with Google Play yet. I have hope that it will in the future."
1,My kids had an RCA tablet before and this is definitely an upgrade! Overall quality is better!
0,"I have not had time to set everything up yet. My granddaughter is enjoying hers! My daughter had an issue when she first set it up, all her books downloaded onto the new one and took up most of her space. I do believe that has been resolved."
1,"A nice update to the original 5W USB Power Adapter. Despite how wonderful the 9W USB Power Adapter is for Kindle Fires, I still actually prefer to use this oldie but goodie due to the way the 9W folds. I actually prefer not to have the pointy bits (lack of a better term) fold away as this causes problems when trying to connect it to something new. I actually prefer this to charging my Kindle Fire faster as the 5W is really for the regular E Ink Kindles like my Kindle Voyager.Now the 9W is fine for traveling and if you leave the charger plugged in. But this new sleek and black and white charger works and turns heads with a white or black cord depending on if you still have those old white cords laying about."
1,"Amazon echo better known as Alexa is much more than a smart speaker. To unlock its true music potential, one should have amazon prime. Great at understanding basic questions, Alexa will also give you news briefs and play music via amazon, Pandora and Spotify membership. The true joy of Alexa is its home automation commands via smartthings, hue, nest, etc. Highly recommended for those seeking more than just a smart speaker with decent mono sound."
1,Nice product . Love the fact that my 5 years sons are gaining computer experiance.
1,"From the moment I set up the box I have not had any problems, I restart it from time to time being that it's a small computer so to speak."
1,Set up was really easy. It has been really fun to play with. I have enjoyed the emails that come giving tips about different commands and fun things it will do.
1,I purchased this for raffle prizes and they're great for the price.
0,"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
1,"Alexa has been the best new addition to our family. This device has helped control lights, HVAC, and our home security system. Alexa provides lots of entertainment with family games like trivia. A big plus is that Alexa will start my car so it's warm for me on cold mornings...she's earning big points in my eyes! ;)"
0,"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
1,"Got this for my college student! She loves it! Uses it for weather, news, speaker and more!"
1,"The echo and Alexa are fun to use, convenient, and way more useful than I thought initially. She is the best roommate ever. She does whatever i ask and doesn't complain about my choices of music."
1,The battery life had been incredible. Fits in my wife's hands comfortably. She can't wait to get her next book.
1,I really like this - Great product and with a few work arounds fits great into the Apple Ecosystem!
1,"So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!"
1,Pretty easy to use...small enough for little hands...nice as card slot toExpand memory
1,"My mom is not computer savvy, however she has really taken to the tablet. It is easy to us and just the right size for her to handle. So glad that Best Buy recommended this product for her."
1,I enjoy the access to alot of the apps. Wish there were more sports apps though
1,Great way to get rid of cable. Easy to setup an de use.
1,"We don't have the fancy tv or lights alexa can control. But, we love the music, weather, adding stuff to our lists and calendar. There are a few games my husband plays --jeopardy, magic door, etc. The trivia and daily news are also awesome."
1,"This is a great tablet, I have the Kindle Fire HD or something like that and I got this for my grand daughter. She loves it, I hate that she's only 9yrs. old and I have to add her tablet to my Amazon account on my tablet cause she doesn't have an email, cause you have to set up an account with email."
1,"I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want."
1,Excellent product. It's well worth the money. I have my system linked to my Iris Security System
1,Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon.
1,"Love Alexa especially if your are a Amazon geek. She does what she is told. lol Ordering finding music, help in kitchen. Find an answer to almost anything!"
1,"Was in special,, easy to get it online and pick up in the store,, nice service and the personal very gentle"
1,Bought as gift and have been very satisfiedGood sound and wonderful life aid
1,It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!
1,just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
1,"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
1,Great for reading on the beach very easy to use ad easytocarry aroumd.
0,"I bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price. However, it only lasted 6 months before the battery died and was not chargeable, regardless of troubLeshooting and what cord or outlet I used.Best Buy said they couldn't do anything but said Amazon could help me since it should be under warranty. I escalated multiple times with Amazon and they refused to help me each time. So save your $49.99 and put it towards a good product."
1,I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It's easy to use and the perfect size for his hands.
1,"I have a Fire tablet like this, so I knew my granddaughter would love it!"
1,Over all the product is good batteries that are supplied seem to of been dead but other wise very good
1,Love how you can ask her to do a lot including lights and cameras . Super fun my grandkids love it too
1,"Perfect tablet not only for experienced users, but those that are not that tech savvy. My mother-in-law is really enjoying the ease of use of this tablet, it was a birthday gift. The quality of the build feels top notch. I need to get one of these to replace my aging tablet and utilize my Prime membership to it's potential."
1,Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good.
1,I have all tipe of tablets. My favorite is the apple but I prefer fire tablets better than Samsung any time.
1,"Basic and no frills,exactly what i wanted for travel :-)"
1,"Where to begin? Let's see...easy wifi or Ethernet setup. Runs all my apps. Runs 4K. Super small footprint. The remote is nice, plus voice activation(if you're into that). Super easy navigation once you setup all your apps."
1,The service that I received was terrific. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely recommend your establishment to my friends and family
1,Works great but I wishI could get rid of the ads on the home screen.
1,Perfect gift for the grandkids. They have great parental controls. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a great gift for any age.
1,I like the tablet its exactly what i needed and also easy to use.
1,I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who has a Amazon prime account. Very good sound from the speaker. Highly recommend.
1,Friends were pleased with gift will be buying one for their family.
1,I love all the apps. All your favorite shows and movies at your fingertips
1,"I gave this Fire 7"" tablet five stars because of the price and quality. You won't find another for the price with so many good features. I purchased it primarily for reading books from Amazon and my library. The screen is excellent. This tablet can enlarge the size for best reading comfort. The sound is very good and it's best when connecting to a set of speakers. There's an advertisement when first logging on, which is not too annoying, (to pay $15 to remove). It's great for beginners and anyone who wants a light, compact tablet to carry around. I also have a 10"" Samsung, but this was difficult and heavy to hold while reading. I also purchased a case to protect the Fire 7"". It makes holding the tablet easier. I can't say enough good things about this tablet. The screen, sound and speed while browsing the internet are very good These were most important to me. I highly recommend the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet."
1,It was a gift. I have been told that they are enjoying it.
1,"The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper. The Voyage has a bezel that's flush with it's glass so it's not the ""crumb catcher"" paperwhite is but hey, maybe you want to skip eating while you're reading and save the dough!"
1,Does all of the basics and then some. A lot more than I expected from a $ 50 unit.
0,"it didn't work I had to return it after Christmas and buy something else, made for a wonderful Christmas mourning"
1,My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go
1,"This is my third Kindle, quite easy to use, kid friendly"
1,This was a gift for my toddler grandson. He loves it.
1,Best tab for kids with very low budget and as another good product from Amazon
1,"The best media player, very easy to work with. Love the 4k display"
1,"Works well with all Kindle models, either as a computer cord or charging cord. My original Kindle came with a charger and cord. The new editions don't. They come with a cord like this - but my mom's got thrown away with the box. This is a perfect replacement."
1,"Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked."
1,Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader.
1,The product worked great and easy to setup. Took the product back as the Fire Stick was all I needed
1,Great tablet for the price. Surfs Web well.great for her to watch netflix on
1,a great item to be able to stream tv/sports/movies without needing to pay a cable company for their services.
1,Back lighting bothers my eyes so I like that you can turn it off
0,The Kindle is better than the older version in the fact that I have used it a lot with game apps for the kids and it was bogged down with memory being used up but I held out on purchasing a new one the scores and in app purchases won't transfer to the new one so I got the new one and it works fast updates apps camera is not so good but all and all 3 stars
1,I love this tablet. Very user friendly and versatile.
1,Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
1,"Looks decent for $40, it would be better add YouTube app."
1,"I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
0,Slow to use because there are constant popups. Barely dropped it 2 feet to the ground and now it doesn't work. Highly unsatisfied.
1,Love this product! We have been able to get everything we need and cancel cable. Saving us lots of money!
1,"I was hesitant at first, but now I love it. I love turning the lights off/on with my echo."
1,"This is a good tablet for basic functions. It was smaller than I expected. We had a Fire when they first came out and I was thinking it would be the same size. The screen size is very small, but I guess that is why it was $49 instead of more expensive. It is good for reading, basic games and kids. But if you want to surf the web, it is really hard to see more than the top few inches of the webpage. It is great with the 8G, but would like a bigger screen for that price! :)"
1,We bought these a Christmas for our 3 children they have been a great present the kids really enjoy them
1,I got this as a gift for my mom. She loves it. I highly recommend it.
0,Bought this in thanksgiving sale. It's a great loss price tablet at the sale price but would not buy it for regular price. Would go for HD model instead by playing a bit extra though.
1,The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.
1,My kids just Love there tablets and they are Very Much worth the price.
1,"operating system is quick, screen colors are great. Easy to use and great for reading on kindle app."
1,originally had a 4g and needed a larger one for my nephew to play games and this is perfect for a 5 year old.
1,A very nice and very helpful tablet. I always bring it with me And it helps a lot with my art career
1,Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. Would have given it 5 stars but it hasn't changed enough from the last Kindle that I purchased several years ago.
1,Very good voice recognition. Wireless operation would be better!
1,"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
1,Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased.
1,MY KIDS HAD MONEY AND BOUGHT THEM FOR $33 ON SALE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THEY LOVE THEM. THEY ARE GREAT AND FAST TABLETS
1,I enjoy it a lot for my son yeah I really enjoyed it and likes it a lot of different options
1,Must have all family member's enjoy and can use love it.
1,"Great idea. Have only started using it, playing music and asking questions."
1,"I bought mine in store, I like having what I buy right away, so I didn't feel the need to buy it online, maybe that is why other people may have had a screen problem, could have been during the shipping process because who knows how well the shipping company treats the packages.I use it mainly for watching netflix, and reading books. I love it, feels like I have a kindle, and whats great about it is that its more than just a kindle so I can do more with it. I already have an iphone, and a huge laptop so I won't be using it for like everything like other people may need it for. So it is worth the price because before I was never planning on buying a tablet because I felt like they were expensive and since I already have a phone and laptop I didn't need it but when this came out I was finally happy to find a tablet that the brand is well known and popular."
1,This tablet is fantastic for the price. It's as good or better than my first fire. The only differences are this one has only 8 gb's of storage but has front and rear cameras. It runs as fast as the other and the resolution is as good.
1,"Bought this tablet for my little cousin and it fitted him perfectly. After 2 or 3 years, i might get him a bigger one."
1,This item was purchased as a gift. I heard nothing bad about this tablet so i can say it is a good tablet for kids.
1,Great item for the price. Reliable and works great.
1,"I had a previous model, one with buttons around the case, not the screen itself. The screen on the one I purchased is brighter, slightly clearer, and the touch screen is far easier to navigate. Well worth purchase price if you want to read without the bulk of a book. Different fonts and word spacing is great, something that will never be available on book. I gave the nook a try but did not like it, the back light was terrible."
0,"This tablet is good to browse the web, check emails, watch youtube videos,... The screen is small but still bigger than any smartphone.It's a bit slow but it's a good bang for the buck.Big drawback: no access to google play and no support for chromecast if you want to cast to your TV."
1,Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
0,"I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. At least it was only $50 :/My nephew has an 1st gen iPad Air, w a kid case; he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. You get what you pay for."
1,I bought it for a gift and the recipient loves it!
1,Wag glad I purchased the Amazon Echo. Easy to set up and link with the two iPads in our home. Use it to play music from ITunes as well as the IPad. Let's me do a quick check on the weather and a joke of the day. Impressed at how sensitive it is as I can speak with it from anywhere in my condo every with background noise. Heartily recommend it to my friends and family.
1,Like the tablet but didn't realize you had to put up with the ads. Also don't like how Amazon blocks a lot of apps. You can get around that though.
1,This speaker is fun and intuitive. Alexia keep learning every day.
1,"My first reader was a Sony and I loved it. But it was getting old and quit working well. So I did research and everyone seemed to like the Kindle Paperwhite and so that's what I bought. I like it. I don't LOVE it, like I did my Sony, because its battery needs to be charged every two weeks. The battery in my Sony lasted much longer than that between charges. But other than that, it works great and is easy to read in any light (sunlight or indoor lighting)."
1,"I loved the Amazon Fire stick but I enjoy the speed and 4k support of this product over the Fire Stick. I have owned and tested AppleTv (1st Gen), Boxee, Roku 4k, Chromecast, Nexus player, and by far the Amazon Fire Tv and stick offer the most and best content; much of which can be used for free. Great layout, easy to use and full of features."
1,Nice tablet for the price. My son liked it. Was easy to use
1,Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
1,Cool that you can link Bluetooth and the Echo and it is a great speaker! Neat features. Alarm clock and timer too. Definitely recommend it.
1,My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos.
1,Perfect for my needs and the needs of my students!
1,This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.
1,Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
1,Works great easy to operate well worth we use it instead off cable tv
1,"This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc."
1,Easy to use and set up. Been having a lot of fun with it.
1,Fire tablet is very simple and sufficient for internet browsing. Amazan Fire is at reasonable cost and cheap.
1,Great product... very reliable under various conditions garage/shed etc.
0,Took around 2 and a half days for the you tube to start the video.... But its decent enough once it started... You can never be sure when it is gonna work and when not
1,Great for my 7 year old son. Has all his games and favorites apps installed. Easy navigation user friendly.
1,I purchased this thinking it would be a cheaper tablet for my son with great graphics. It is exactly that.
1,"I love Alexa, she is fun to use and easy to use. She still needs to learn more though."
1,"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
1,"I bought this for my mom, who is 90 years old. She loves it, and it makes so much reading material available to her in a format that is easy to use and very accessible. Good job, Kindle!"
1,"I have been using this reader for a couple of months, and I am wondering how come I waited so long to buy one!"
1,"Lightweight, seems very durable. Bought so my toddler can use my kindle on a flight in a few weeks."
0,"I bought it cause I wanted to read more. That didn't happen, I tried and I just can't read on devices I need old school paper between my hands"
1,Like having an assistant. Use it to multi task while I'm at home and work.
1,Gave this gift to my girlfriends dad for Christmas and he absolutely loved it.
1,Just love got it for my granddaughter just plain great
0,Thought the Echo was portable. Have to keep it plugged it to operate or buy an external battery.Returned and bought the smaller TAP which has a builtin battery.
1,What more can i say it works great and it's cheap.
0,if you just want something basic cheap and cannot afford something better then it would be fine. But I needed it to do certain things that the other one was to small to handle.
1,"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet."
1,"I bought this tablet for my granddaughter. She loves it, it's easy for her to use, and just right for her size."
1,"Sound quality is exceptional. Responds incredibly fast. Just wish it's bank of knowledge was larger/more extensive so it could answer ALL of my direct, fairly simple questions."
1,"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light"
1,"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
0,"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
1,This product definitely gets the job done plus more! Plus I couldn't beat the low price offered by Best Buy!
1,I purchased an ASUS 2 in 1. I love it. It was so much easier to switch all my documents and load programs from my other PC. The only problem I had was the facial recognition. It kept saying it did not recognize me and got locked up. Customer Service was very nice and got me going again.
1,I was using a Kindle Fire HD 7--love this new one!!
1,"Got this for my ""non-techy"" husband and he now uses it daily. Easy to learn to use. Harder to figure out how to print."
1,"I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader."
1,Purchased as a gift - recipient has been enjoying the Kindle
0,"Good value for the price, though a little slow loading some apps."
1,"Unlike the fire stick, this item does not over heat."
1,This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase
1,"Kindle is the best. In this version, storage and resolution screen has been improved."
1,I could not be happier with the functionality of Alexa. She also has a great sense of humor.
1,"What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much."
1,"This product is similar to my old kindle; however, I wish the touch screen was more responsive or it had manual page buttons on the side. Overall it's great"
1,Ok but I wouldn't go to the trouble of buying this again. All I get is the weather and some music and it's really a waste of money and time. Even though Siri is slow at least serious with me all the time and this rests on my desk or on the table top and that's about it
1,"I bought this thinking I would be a cord cutter, but the service I have if I do that would make just my internet within $$ of what I pay for both internet & TV. BUT...I love the extra choices that the Fire TV Box gives. SO many choices to try, some free, some free trials and some pay that I really enjoy. Cons...you DO need a very stable internet connection for this device and I wish there was more guidance available on use. Set up was E-Z. Literally 1-2-3. but after that is trial & error to navigate and is why 4 stars not 5."
1,"I really love my kindle fire, it is awesome! And I love that I could order it in blue. I love to read and play word games on it"
1,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.
1,I purchased this for a Christmas gift to my niece she is learning a lot from it and it keeps her occupied with the games she loaded to it smart choice for first time tablet and its a great brand
1,These are great devices for the price. Good performance and awesome warranty. Having the Freetime is also very nice as app purchases are less frequent.
1,"For the price this tablet is not bad (it was a $35 black Friday purchase). It does Amazon prime, netflix, surfs, etc. It is not a truly ""open"" android system, as it's locked down in some ways by Amazon (i.e. you cannot easily access the google play store). Some apps do not run on this tablet (presumably due to system specs). I think I had trouble getting Disney Channel app for this tablet, which is a shame.But for $35, it's hard to expect too much."
1,Did every thing we expected. I think it is like having someone to help you. It has the weather for any city I need it for. Plays the music I want to hear
1,Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. I thought I saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if I find this to be true. Would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.
1,Easy to use and simple tablet. For the money can't go wrong.
1,Gave as a gift to my wife. She loves the size. Good battery life. Now needs to find a cover for it.
1,I purchased this as a gift and it went over very well. She loved it.
1,"I have been using my echo for about 90 days and I love it. I use is to control the lights and fans in my home. Almost any song I ask it to play it will. It tells me the traffic on the exact route I take to work and informs me of the weather. It tells me the scores of my favorite sports teams, keeps my shopping lists, and settles arguments when my family can't agree on a correct answer to some random question. It also makes ordering things from Amazon a breeze! It's constantly learning new things, so it's getting better every day. Love it so much I bought one for my son and mother."
1,I really like fire tv box it is user friendly and and I would recommend it to anyone I know.
1,"I like to refer this product for low budget tablet future owner. It has all the features needed in tablet at lower price. Good display, long battery life, good wifi connection, better speed"
1,The echo is fun and friendly and certainly helps with the kids math. Always fun to ask her random questions and try out new skills. Have one in all the kids rooms. Great for music listening.
1,"It's a great value & easy to use. Love the screen for easy reading & being able to access my games, music, & have access to the web."
1,"Nothing flashy. If you want something simple that you can just grab and go, use with babies/toddlers, throw around etc then this tablet is great. If you want something a little more robust save up for one of the more expensive models."
1,"I have since bought two Dots also, but the Alexa is the champ. Integrated with Insteon hub, thermostat, devices for whole house voice control also."
1,We bought these for our kids and they really love them
1,"Amazon - Echo - Black is a powerful and versatile product. BestBuy had the best price available for this product, at the time of my purchase."
1,The screen is clear and battry last for 8hr. The camera is easy to use and can been taken for good pictures.
1,Bought for our toddler so our kids wouldn't fight over my oldest daughters. They love them.
1,I love this tablet. It's durable and my niece loves it
1,"While everything about the Kindle Fire 7 is great, it is lacking good sound"
1,If you want to read anytime where there's a light source this is thereafter for you. If you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model.
1,This is my first E-reader and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size for me and I love the way I can adjust the brightness and the font.
1,"Echo is a great price of tech for the household. From playing music, controlling outdoor lights to answering numerous questions the kids have. So much Echo can do and they keep adding ""skills"" which are apps for it. No Brainer!!"
1,"I like how it runs Android, so I can sideload any app for Android on the Amazon fire TV. I just wish it supports NTFS file system and have a volume control and power for the actual TV (like a universal remote)"
1,"I initially purchased this Echo in order to be able to complete a verb al shopping list. I did not see myself using any of the other features. Well , I was wrong. I love this! I use it to make my shopping list, set timers for cooking, get a weather report, get traffic conditions, get a news update and with a Wemo plug to turn the lights off and on. I love it and I am going to purchase Echo Dots to place throughout my home and use with this Amazon Echo."
1,We got this item for my parents to use - who are not the most tech savvy - and even they love to use it! It took them a few days to catch on and fully understand how it works and why its so great but now they each want one of their own
1,"I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores."
1,"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
1,"Daughter, 8 yrs old, was starting to go thru books quickly and graduating to 2-300 page books. With my Amazon Prime membership, you also get a large selection of books available for free download... saving big bucks. Device is light weight and has a long battery life. If you have an Amazon prime membership and a reader in the house, this devise is a no-brainer and will pay for itself."
1,It's Great! I like being able to add things to my shopping list and set timers just by asking.
1,"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
1,The best item I have ever seen in my life and so glad I found this item....:)
1,This tablet was great for my boys. I would highly recommend for young kids. A+++
1,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
1,I LOVE THIS AMAZON FIRE. AND THE PRICE IS AFFORDABLE. LOVE IT
1,I enjoy it very much. It works good and does what it is supposed to do
1,"Love this product, and Alexa has become a good friend. I didn't think I would use this device that much, but I was wrong. From the time I get up for work to the time I turn in for the night, I can always think of something interesting to ask Alexa!"
1,"I caught this on the black Friday sale. Works well, way faster than the fire stick."
1,The echo is absolutely amazing. You can ask Alexa almost anything and she'll respond with an answer. My only downfall with the echo and the reason I only gave 4 stars is because you can't really ask her to play a song with Apple Music. She works better with an android phone. I had to pay for Spotify to be able to ask her to play a certain song.
1,Great contrast and battery life with easy user interface.
1,Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
1,"Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale."
1,This is my husband's second Paperwhite because the first received water damage when his waterproof case leaked. He bought a Nook at a pawnshop because it was cheap but he missed his Kindle. Bought this one for his birthday.
1,"Ordering this online to pick up at the store was easy until I got to the store where, as usual, there were workers standing around yet I had to wait several minutes for someone to address me at the pickup desk then I had to wait to pay for it at the registers. I would have thought I could purchase it at the pickup center. Honestly, if it weren't for the increased risk of stolen delivery items during the Christmas season, I probably would have gone with Amazon to purchase the Kindle. (The price was the same through both retailers.)"
1,"It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want."
1,"I am content with this purchase,bought it for my 5 year old and she loves it."
1,I purchase this item for my daughter and she absolutely love the item and color.
1,"This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy."
1,"I bought this to give as a door prize gift for a nonprofit. they loved it, I was impressed with the reviews and proud to donate it as a gift."
1,Bought the original Kindle a number of years ago and really enjoyed. This newer model is terrific. Fits comfortably in the hand and the readability is excellent. Downloading is even easier than before. I really enjoy using this product. Would definitely recommend!
1,"Still learning how to use all the features. Searching is a breeze. Can search by many options. Have used it by actor, movie title, or show title. It will bring back what is available and sometimes advises of other sources (ie. Netflix). The voice search feature is a homerun! No more typing in the name without a keyboard!"
1,Remote is just the right size and it gives you an instant response.
1,Great price only not enough memory I bought an extra memory card and my wife was very pleased. It was a very good birthday present!
1,"No problems, enjoy being able to watch movies without paying additional fees to rent. Netflix & hulu accounts are available"
1,"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it."
1,"The Amazon fire TV is a simple to install and use as advertised. All you need is your own HDMI cable and everything else is provided for you. Set up took minutes. I really like how fast the Fire TV is. I use it almost exclusively for Netflix, Hulu, and live TV streaming thru PlayStation Vue. I chose the Fire TV over the TV stick because the Fire TV has a faster processor and it works beautifully. I would definitely recommend this box for anyone who's looking to cut the cord from cable."
1,This item was purchased for my grandson and he Love's it
1,"This is my first Paperwhite and I love it. I've had a kindle keyboard (loved it), kindle fire (was okay), kindle fire HD (good for a tablet) but i just love a good ol' eReader for reading. Nothing else will do and this Paperwhite is perfect to read in dark and bright situations. PLUS....The battery last FOREVER!!"
1,"It is so much easier reading books with this. The backlight is good as long as set really low. It froze once, but it recovered."
1,"Like the product a lot. Mostly use it for playing music, not very useful though if you have a bad ISP."
1,My Grandson uses this just about every night. It was a great purchase and we're glad we made it.
1,"You couldn't ask for a best tablet for the price, great quality."
1,"Bought this for my mother, size is just right. This was a perfect choice for her first tablet. Wish I had bought myself one too."
1,My son was very happy with his Christmas gift. Kindle unlimited a must!
1,One of the best items I have ever purchased.. The fun never ends with the amazon echo
1,"Works great. Easy to set up, watch youtube.com for it. Some streams better quality than others."
1,Easy to use and kid friendly. The price is more than fair on these and offers some decent viewing options. If it breaks no big deal to replace it!
1,Great improvement in 4k downloads over regular fire stick on Samsung 4k set
1,First of all I pleased on how easy it was to buy the product on line and it was here exactly the date that they said it would be. I enjoy the kindle it's easy to use.
1,My wife uses & is quality product to use longer term.
1,"While generally a minor upgrade from the paperwhite, it's just the best e-reader on the market. X-ray seemed unnecessary until I was reading game of thrones and forgot who certain people were. The choice to swipe or pinch to change pages is nice too. It's a great device though if you're on a budget you would do fine with the last version."
1,"I love the Amazon Fire TV box, Amazon makes great products that are great for anyone."
1,Read online and price compared to get a great deal
1,I am very happy with my purchase. It is very small which I like because it can fit just about anywhere and does not take up much room
1,"If I have to make an addition to my list, Alexa does it for me...it remember my music and it's the best companion.So far I've purchased 2 Echos and 3 Dots"
0,"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
1,"Once you start to figure out all this will do , you will be very happy with your purchase"
1,Fun thing to have. And the voice activation for lights and everything is really cool
1,We really love being by able to play music with her.
1,I had the original Kindle and still use it but this new one is a delight. The screen is very bright and touchable. This makes it easier to read and also to turn pages.
1,Pros: preloaded with everything your kids will need.Cons: need to buy at least 32GB microSD with it.
1,"I got this for $33 on black friday. It was a great deal, but the ads are kind of annoying. Ads go away after you turn the tablet on, but it is a bit distracting at times. However, it is a small price to pay for such a nice tablet. It is a nice little device to keep on hand for web browsing and watching Netflix before bed."
1,Fast set up. Long battery life. Lots of options books. Music. Games..
1,"Great price for the internal memory size. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is it!"
1,I bought this one for my wife. She loves it. I highly recommend this Kindle reader.
1,Me and my Boyfriend naught this for his niece so she could play games on it. She liked being able to have us download games to help her spell on it v
1,Upgrading from an older version. This kindle is so much faster. Love my new kindle.
1,This is a great tablet ! I got it on sale around Thanksgiving and it was worth it.
1,"The screen is very clear and it's fairly light. IMO, the interface on the Nook is a little better, but the Kindle ecosystem is much better."
1,"Bought it for my 4yr ild daughter, and its good for kids. A little different from a regular android tablet. Layout has alot going on but can get used to it."
1,I was searching for kindle for gifting it to my bro. I got the best deal at bestbuy.
1,"Bought this tablet to give to a teenager for Christmas. Expected them to use it for games, etc."
1,I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! I still can't get over how the kindle pages look like actual pages. Highly recommended for everyone!
0,Bought the tablets for my kids. The tablet isn't really friendly for them. The home pages try to take you to amazon stuff only and when they download games it's kind of hard to find them. Battery life can't hold up to a 5yr old. He runs it dead quicker then it can charge.
1,enjoy all the upgrades. would suggest it to others
0,"I bought this originally for a younger child to download apps for learning for school and for a few games. It works well, no issues with that, but it is a little harder for him to navigate. From my standpoint, it is smooth and operates the way I expect it."
1,"It's a good product if you use Amazon apps for movies and music. I myself use Google and Cromecast, so I found that the Google Home worked better for me"
1,I purchased this for a family member for Christmas. I've owned this tablet and it's great.
1,"bought this tablet for my 5 year old granddaughter. Great value for the money and with Amazon Prime membership you get access to hundreds of videos, games and music."
1,"Boy was I surprised. I never intended to cut the cord but after I purchased my Amazon Fire TV and DirectNow TV o thought I'd give it a shot. Now I'm saving $80 per month, have all of the channels I watched on cable, and I'm saving $80 per month and very pleased!"
1,Bought 2 for my kids great price well worth it. Works great on wi fi
1,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas she had the original Kindle and it broke after years of use. At first she was disappointed that the screen was so small, but now that she's been using it she loves it ! Much easier to hold and flip pages !"
1,"Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus."
1,"Got this for both my children after the constant breaks on more expensive products. The best decision I've made!They are happy. Apps are amazing.If you are using this for internet usage... not so much.If going to amazon app store and books, it is awesome!"
1,I bought two of these kindles for two grandsons. They are very good with electronic items even though they are young
1,"Personally, I think the Kindle should have come with this item as 99 of people would need this. It works fine."
1,Great book reader. Works great in sunlight as well!
1,Its great .................................................
1,My son loves it! He plays with it daily. This is his 2nd kindle (we upgraded versions).
1,Great alternative to cable. Easy to use and set up
0,"It is a nice tablet to have, however I do not like the setup for making a kid profile and not being able to download to their profile. Also do not like amazon's charge for a kid profile."
1,"Nice device, but I wish it was wireless. Having a cord minimizing the mobility."
0,"Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though."
1,I have bought several Kindle Fire's over the years. I think they are great for streaming movies & videos. You can downloaded movies on the device and use it while off wi-fi.
1,"This does 4k, Netflix, Hulu Amazon prime video, and Playstation Vue. Does it all and works flawlessly. Have used Amazon fire stick before and there is lag. No here with this product ."
1,"My old fire stick had just died. So I upgraded, now I have the power to stream with no lag."
1,Bought this kindle almost 2 years ago and it's still going strong.
1,Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world.
1,Better cost effective tablet for basic usage of browsing
1,Great tablet for my kid. Great price great performance
1,"My family and I have been using multiple devices to listen to music and other types of entertainment for awhile. We are trying to get more out of some of the smart devices we own, so this was a good first step to integrate various devices we already use into a voice controlled assistant."
1,"A little slow loading compared to my HDX which just had the screen broken, so needed a less expensive replacement. Great for reading books of course!"
1,Works great. Hooked it up to our smart lights. Very convenient and useful
1,"This tablet is excellent! I'm able to download books, watch hulu and Netflix, as well as play games. Overall a wonderful product!"
1,One of my best purchase yet. One of the cool feature is the alarm.. I tend to over sleep sometime.
1,"Currently building a house and went ahead and purchase the echo to start 'building' my smart home. We currently use it for just the basic stuff right now (music, timers, weather, random questions) and love it. My 5 year old daughter loves being able to tell Alexa to play her favorite songs so she can dance. I plan to purchase a couple of compatible thermostats next as well as some smart plugs that work with Alexa."
1,"This is my second Kindle. The improvements over the older generation Kindles is huge. This Kindle is thin and light, I put it in my pocketbook and take it all over. The backlight is handy when needed. The screen clarity is excellent. Great device."
1,I bought this Best Buy! They are great and hook me up with the best deals :)
1,I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it
1,Easy to read books and it holds a great deal. Ideal to take on a vacation.
1,We canceled cable and love our firebox. It saves us about $200 a month.
1,I downloaded dozens of books and stream movies and tv with no problem in a wi-fi setting. The battery life is not too great. I can stream for about 3 hours and need a recharge but it's great for the price.
1,I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children
0,"I purchased this amazon fire. Because, Reviews are good. But, I realized they left reviews before they receive it.I found couple of issues not to buy this tablet.1. It is impossible to use google account.Even You can log in gmail account.2. Bad for web surfing. There are so many limits for web surfing.3.This issue is only for Koreans. It is impossible to type & see Korean language.Do not buy this tablet if you are Korean.I do not know why this tablet does not support Korean. Even supports other Asian countries languages as like Chinese, Japanese. Etc...."
1,This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.
0,"Great tablet for the price! I bought two of these for my Grandkids to use, as they are always using ours! The only thing that I really don't like about them is that they have so many pop in commercials for grown ups and it makes everything stop. Hard for my little three year old to get this! I wish it were a little more kid friendly as far as ease of use and getting to where you want to be. For the price, I guess we will just deal with it! :)"
1,"It is a little bit heavier then I expected, especially if you hold it for long. And I don't really like the flash when changing pages...Yet, it is much better then iPad or mini if you are reading an e-book. I bought it for my pregnancy cause I can read books while breast feeding~"
1,"Great tablet for internet, mail, calander, reading books, etc."
0,I can't get my tablet to set the time so I haven't been able to even use it a little disappointed with this purchase no instructions came with it!!
1,"For the price, it's a decent tablet. They way they get the price down is to psuh ads to your device. You can pay $15 to get the ads removed. Overall it's a good tablet."
1,I like the tablet for ease of use. It's a little slow in my opinion. Battery is good
1,we love this tablet and the price. awesome deal. it was so good we going back to get two more. it's amazing .. can't say no more except get you one
1,Amazon Echo is the best voice command device for everyone in the family
0,"Bought for my kids and very easy to use, and made homework easier"
1,"My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell."
1,"My wife and I have been trying to decide between the Paperwhite and the new Nook for a while. After checking each out, the Paperwhite was definitely a clear winner. Amazon support + unique features = a newfound interest in reading!"
1,Easy stocking stuffer or gift exchange. Reasonably priced also.
0,It is ok but I like my bigger screen one but it broke in less than two years
1,This tablet was a gift for my 10 yr old who loves my larger table. He loves it and it gets the job done for him.
1,This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning.
0,"Asked a Bestbuy employee if I could connect to my library. He told me yes so I bought the Kindle. When I got it home, found out that downloading books from my library was not an option, so I returned Kindle."
1,"I wanted a tablet that would actually work, this also has a good camera"
1,"She tells jokes, controls my lights and music, sets alarms... I actually got it on sale soooo I think it's pretty worth it. Not sure if full price is a good deal or not."
0,"I bought my son a kindle about 6 months ago and it was great.... Until my husband dropped it and broke the screen. So I bought my son another one last week, but I think it might be defective becuz the battery died not fully charge or it takes a super long time to charge, where this did not happen with my last one"
1,"alot of great free educational gaming, reasonable price only downfall is sometimes it runs a tad slower than a tablet"
1,"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
1,"I bought this a few weeks ago and use it every day. i've had no problems and it works perfectly! My only complaint is the camera. The pictures are not as clear as I would prefer. All in all though, for the price, I would buy it again!"
1,It`s better with a bundle of a memory cardThe operating systen doesn`t have google play by default
1,"I first bought an Echo Dot during Prime Day and almost instantly regretted not getting the Echo. So when Best Buy had the Echo on sale at Prime Day price, I bought it.The Echo is very easy to set up. The speaker system on the Echo versus the Dot is amazing. Very rich sound and it carries well. I have it set up in my living room and when I have a playlist going, I can hear it clearly in my bedroom (at the other side of the house). I've got 2 Echo Dots as well and like the intercom feature--my dog isn't a fan. LOL:-)"
1,The Echo is incredible. It gives you instant responses to questions thatYou ask. It is easy to pair with your phone and Internet. It has many unique features such as pairing with your lights and thermostat in your house if you purchase those specific pairing devices.
1,Bought tablet for my 4 yr old daughter very easy to set up and works awesome .
1,We recently dropped cable to save some money and this has been great. I literally can't think of a movie or tv show that I can't find on the FireTv.
1,Sturdy and easy to use. Not bad for teenagers to use
1,"I love the size, the portability, the reading options, the organization options, the look of the pages, and the price. You can't go wrong with the Kindle PaparWhite!"
1,Had a fire stick and loved it. Eventually got this because I wanted the 4K capabilities. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. I use it for sling tv a lot as well.
1,Got his tablet for my 7 year old she so she could play apps and watche videos. Works great and to be able to add memory is a plus.
1,For under $40 it is a great buy for a tablet. I don't like that the charger port is next to the buttons on the side.
1,Kindle voyage is the costliest of the kindle range but its worth it due to light weight and adaptive backlight. Enjoying it so far.
1,The features are endless. Perfect device for those who like to go hands free with doing simple tasks!
0,Hey man who was the only way to the next few days ago by the way to get the latest version of this message has a lot more than just the right now
1,This is a great tablet for the money!! I would recommend it to anyone...
1,great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday
1,amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
1,"Easy set up, easy to use! Highly recommend to anyone!"
1,"Great tablet for my kids to use. Plenty of apps to choose, easy to set up and add parental controls. Cheap enough as well for what my kids use it for games and videos instead of spending 4 times as much on a different tablet"
1,I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
1,Easy to setup and use. Had it pulled off the patio table onto concrete (10 min after I had it setup). Didn't dent it or damage it beyond some scratches. Battery would be great feature to add.
1,Great gift for someone who has everything! Very entertaining
1,Setup was going great until the remote stopped working. Replaced batteries several times but did not help. Had to return product.
1,Bought this as a Christmas present because I received one last year and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a hit !
1,My son loves his tablet!!no matter how many tapes he drops it its still works great!very satisfied with my purchase.
1,"Much better interface than Roku, love the 4K features"
0,If you want an inexpensive device to read Kindle books or do email this is it.
1,"Got this for my wife and she loves it, it's small but runs great"
0,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
1,"The kindle is perfect for fast browsing, reading ebooks, my kids love the product and I am now using the tablet for work. It fits perfectly in my bag and with the swipe method I can type a lot faster."
1,Excellent for streaming TV thru internet. Makes an excellent alternative to cable TV.
1,We really find Alexa very intuitive and works with ease. Would recommend to others.
1,The Amazon Echo is the missing link to the complete smart home strategy. A must get for anyone looking to unify their smart home devices into a sensible and easy to use gadget.
1,I was concerned it would be difficult to set up. Turned out very easy to set up and to use.
1,my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.
1,I purchased this as a gift for my great aunt. It's easy to use and light enough for her to carry around.
1,LOVE MY ITEM AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS BEST BUY
1,Easy to use for daily usage . Small and can be hold using one hand . Very good option for kid .
1,Notbing beats it. I tried getting the app on my iPad and it works. But nothing like the reader itself. I bring it everywhere. It's light and I hardly notice it in my bag.
1,"I love it, very easy to use and so much information so readily available. It's limitless to what it can be used for, from a radio to encyclopedia with no effort and no set up."
1,Great product. Works well with all my smart devices.
1,This case fit my Amozon Fire great. It was just what I wanted.
1,This tablet was well worth the price. It is a little slower than an iPad but not by much. Works great with clear quality on the screen!
1,This is a great device. I purchased this for the music but discovered it does so much more. I highly recommend the echo. I also purchased the echo dot for my office.
1,"Bought this for my girlfriends daughter, she can access Facebook, Netflix and many more apps now.. Nice convenient size. Good deal!"
1,Got it on Black Friday got a great deal nice little tablet
1,"Great reader, bought it for my wife at a great price."
1,Does what is needed. Can watch both Amazon and Netflix on TV
1,"I read the reviews, watched the YouTube videos, did tons of research and talked myself into getting an Echo. I am so glad I did. It has been the most useful thing I've purchased in years, turning out to be one of the most fun ones, too. I get my news, weather, music and audio books with nothing more than a request to Alexa. I also control my Nest thermostat and Philips Hue lights with a request as well. I have my alarms set up through my Echo as well as my shopping list, to do list and about a hundred other things it seems. I love my Echo, I think you'll love it, too."
1,It is very easy to set up and get started. The graphics are very clear. It Has everything you need.
1,"Bought this a month ago. Well worth the money. Excellent size and quality of use. This is my second Amazon tablet. Bought one for my Grandson. Loved his. Decided to buy another. You also access Alexa from this tablet. Only one problem, battery doesn't last as long as it could on a full charge. The large screen makes it great for watching movies on Amazon Prime."
1,"I have been using Amazon Fire products for almost a year when they first came out, and the 2nd generation Fire TV box is much faster! It is easy to use, and I can access all my favorite streaming video apps - and Amazon Prime services are great! There is so much content available with this device.Now adding Alexa integrates with the Alexa app on my phone. I can see my shopping list, which comes in handy."
1,Purchased as a gift. They absolutely love it! Great for beginners
1,I like it alot it has the basics that my children needed and even my husband loves it so we will be coming back for a few more :)....
1,"I'm very happy that I purchased the Amazon tv with voice remote. I was spending $108 a month, so I'm looking forward to the savings!"
1,"Bought this for my 2 years old son, and he loves it. I installed few kids games, enough to keep him busy and learn colors, shapes, animals, etc. Best Buy delivered the tablet on time as promised. Very satisfied with the purchase."
1,Easy to use and download books. I like carrying many books with me in this tidy little package.
0,Great easy to use great pictures great price. Awesome

1,"8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app."
1,i'm an avid reader and love the Kindle Voyage. i love the adjustable fonts and that it automatically adjust to the light settings. The push sides to flip pages but not if you accidentally bump the wrong side which has happened a few times. Great battery life it's usually a couple of days before i have to recharge.
0,"If you were looking for a tablet thats cheap, this is it. Great for watching netflix"
1,"Although I did like the Roku navigation a little better, the Amazon Fire TV has given us everything we need to feel good about not having cable anymore. We started with one and have gone back to buy 2 more."
1,"I love that this works just like the dot, which I already have 3. However in addition it is portable and has better speaker"
1,"I am now able to stream tv and movies from around the world, works great."

1,This is my first Kindle. Previously I have owned several Nooks. The Voyage is lightweight and the built in dimming light works great. I would give it the edge over the Nook.

1,This tablet is easy to use and it connects to my Wi-Fi easy as well.
1,Very easy and portable I take it everywhere with me

1,We really love our Echo. We have so much fun playing around with her.
1,"great for streaming music, getting weather or news flashes, and we always enjoy trying to answer the extra Jeopardy question from each category every night."
1,It was for a gift and it has been really liked by the receiver.
1,The resolution and contrast are good. It is comfortable to read books on this device. the price is ok. I would say it is a good reading device .
1,Much better than my original Kindle. Lighter and easier to read. The old Kindle served me well and I won't retire it but it;s newer version is good.
1,I'm enjoying it and finding it to be good except it doesn't record.
1,My niece loved it! I love that it is designed especially for kids. She
1,great products lots good appscompatible with many appsloves the speed and quality of priduct for the money
0,"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
1,"Ive always used apple devices, but this little gadget is full of surprises"
1,"I have used them all, but when it comes to performance this tops them all. Its a very powerful device. Especially if you LAN wire it, I hardly experience buffering with my streams. Perfect for open-source media players such as Kodi and Plex."
1,for the money nice tablet perfect fo my seven year old granddaughter
1,Tablet is exactly what I was looking for. Works great.
1,"My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at."
1,Bought this for my son who is in college. He has most of his class books online and wanted this tablet to read his course books versus having to tote around his laptop all the time. He uses it almost exclusively and loves the small light option to carrying his laptop all the time.
1,I gave the Echo to my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.
1,I have the basic kindle but decided to get this one. Now it's my main reading device.
1,We got a great deal on our kindle fire. Perfect gift for young child who wants to play games on a tablet.
1,Bought it for my nephew and he loves it;his old one was slow and the space for bigger apps was limited.Good parental controls.
1,"maybe i got a dud, but from every forum i read it seemed the fire tv box was 10x better then the stick. although it is faster, i still have a lagging experience with this streaming device"
1,Unfortunately my grandson has broken the glass somehow.
1,Can't beat the price a lot cheaper than other companies prices for a tablet and it works well
1,"The voyage is lighter, and thinner than the paperwhite. I love it!"
1,The paper white feels kinda like real paper. The page is clear and bright. I love to read at night. It's awesome
1,"It is nice to take to the grocery store with my list of food I need, not as heavy as my iPad."
1,"My wife has used a Kindle Fire for years now and it was time to upgrade her. This device went on sale right before Mother's Day and I knew it was time to upgrade her 3 year old device. I picked a color and ordered and delivery to the store and pickup was just in time for the weekend. Overall, great product and great service from Best Buy for getting it to me in time."
1,Love my echo and going to purchase a second one for an RV.
1,Great tablet and price for my four year old she really enjoys it
1,"Very Fast, Excellent Quality. The most I like is Alexa! You can ask whatever you want and she will respond"
1,Tablet was everything I expected and some. Great product for the price.
1,This thing is great it not only plays music but you can tell her what grocerys you need & she will add them to a list & email them to you in real time.
1,"Bought tablet for my daughter and like the price point and it's capabilities, along with the parental controls."
1,"I bought this kindle for my daughter, she loves it. Now I have three kindles at home for my kids."
1,"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop. This does not compete with them. Absolutely outstanding outside in Dallas. This does not overheat, with absolutely zero glare. Yes I can read in the pool on a sunny day. I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail. I wish the unit was truly water resistant and it's built in browser is almost worthless. This is an eReader and not a tablet."
1,"This is my 3rd Fire TV, so yes, I am a proud owner. I am able to watch any program that is on cable television with a simple tweak and you can too if you do a little bit of research. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Heck, I would even recommend it to Charlie Mix."
1,New for 2015 tablet is some what different to use than the 2 version. Bought these for gifts.
1,"no problems so far.I am satisfied so far, however, it was just hooked up yesterday and I've only used it a few times."
1,Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use
0,I can't use until I can get the webroot installed...I tried a geek but they wanted $40 to do it...I only paid that much for the tablet. Print is so small I can barely read it...there is probably an adjustment to font size but I don't want to get online without the webroot protection.
1,"Understand me very well, Use it to turn on liights, open the gargae , etc."
1,I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet.
1,"My kids love it, great for games and youtube video"
1,"If you know what you like you can easily use this instead of cable and save yourself a whole bunch of money. Has lots of great features, like Netflix and Hulu, and its very easy to use. The direct connect to your router makes for a flawless connection! We also have the firestick but this is better for a busy room like the living room. Definitely a great investment!"
1,Gave this as a Christmas gift & they loved it. I had to buy a couple more!
1,"I love this product,echo. Easy to use and the direction is simple to understand, I don't recommend children to use it, it's voice activated and if a child doesn't speak clearly the echo will pick up words similar to what they're trying to say and the echo may give inappropriate info based on the sound of the word. Speak clearly when using it. This is not a toy for young children."
1,I love the new kindle. I have a third generation and the new features are awesome.
1,I love the jokes and music. It brings my favorite songs with great speaker quality.
1,I recommend this product to anyone who loves to read...great great great
1,"A friend at work mentioned this product and told me that it is pretty decent for movies. I am amazed at just how much content you can access on this fire tv box. If you like to watch tv; movies, cable series and play games you can't go wrong with this purchase."
1,"This is my second kindle paperwhite. I lost my first one on a plane, so I had to replace it as soon as I got home from my trip. It's a great e-reader and is easy to set up and manage. Never had any problems."
1,"Kindle works really well in sunlight, there is no glare. Very easy to use and navigate."
1,Its the best and affordable tab for every one and super cool
0,"Very limited in capabilities. I am used to using ""OK Google"" on my phone.... Alexa is nowhere near as helpful or intuitive. It's more like Siri Wish it were easier to put iTunes purchases in the Amazon library for Alexa to play. That said, I knew what I was getting. Hoping the technology improved within a couple years."
1,Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value.
1,I Luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to
1,"The screen quality is excellent, and while not all android apps are available for the Fire, a vast number are. The batter life is very good and the responsiveness for the apps that I use is wonderful. my number one negative is it's continued use of the old industry standard USB cord and socket for charging. My wife often uses the tablet while it is plugged in, which leads to damage to the socket and the connector. This intern will lead to a third rate connection and the eventual inability to charge the device. I'm hoping that the new standard (USB C) will fix this problem in the future. For now, don't use the tablet (or any tablet) while it is plugged in!"
1,We bought Amazon Echos for both mothers for Mother's Day. They are learning to use them but love them so far!
1,Movies were great. Would recommend to all my friends and family!
0,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
1,"This is a good tablet for what you pay for it. You can read books,play games and surf the web. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have bought one with more storage!"
1,"This a great tablet for the price. Compared to other tablets that are twice as expensive, this one is far better for the money."
1,"It has sleep timer capability alarm I use it at work, or use it at home while I'm in the shower and I'll bring it to Friends houses and we use Alexa to gain information or just have fun. quality a 9 its loud too."
1,I got this because it was much cheaper than the iPad and it supports flash. The bonus comes with the ability to binge on my Netflix series and listen to music.
1,Install was easy. Only issue was using it with PSVue.
1,I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in
1,My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it
1,Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
1,Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.
1,my daughter loves it. she plays several games on her kindle.
1,"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button."
1,Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
1,The Paper white replaces my original Kindle. I really like the new screen because it is easy on my eyes. Great improvement to an already great product. May purchase one for my wife.
1,"Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2"
1,Needed a tablet that I could use at night before going to bed that wouldn't have bright light and this does the trick.
1,Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!!
1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 4YR OLD. WE HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET AS IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. FROM WHAT I READ THIS WILL DO THE JOB FOR HIM. THE PRICE AND COLOR WAS GREAT.
1,My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.
0,It was a nice tablet for the price. It's a nice beginner tablet and a good tablet for children.
1,"Bought for my wife, and she love's it. It's fast and very convenient!"
1,Bought it as a xmas gift for my daughter who doesn't read too much and now with the purchase of Amazon Kindle she's reading more.. plus she gets to play android games.
1,Great tablet that works well for ebooks and basic apps such as internet browsers etc. Great bargain for the money.
1,The Amazon fire is a good tablet for everyday use.
1,This is a great tablet. It's user friendly and has some great features. Great buy.
0,"I do not like the fact that every thing is in pictures instead of words. On my old paper white I had a list of unread books, now I have pictures. I don't read pictures. If there is a way to make it into a list, I have yet to find it. I thought the that reading is the point."
1,"Very good tablet. Only issue was starting it up. Great processor, lots of storage and great camera. Highly recommended for the price. Practical Steal."
1,I like this Fire very much. The background is bright so reading is easy. It would have been nice to have some instructions included.
1,I love my Alexa I can ask it questions and it gives me the answers I can use the timer on it it's pretty handy.
1,This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
1,I bought this for my friends kid. It works perfectly. There are no problems so far.
1,Love how covenant and quick it is. Easy to use and universal.
1,"A must have for the smart home designer! I use my echo to control my Phillips Hue lighting, TP Link outlets and switches, Nest smart thermostat and my Home Theater Equipment! Plus having information just a question away is awesome!"
1,This is very different from my other kindle it does so much more the read books.
1,I bought two of these as Christmas gifts and my little sisters absolutely love these!! Almost as fast as my iPad. Hopefully they continue to work this way.
1,Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age!
1,Nice tablet for reading articles and downloading books. A downside is Amazon limits some of the apps that are available. For the price it's a good buy for my purpose.
1,"It isn't my first e-reader Amazon - Kindle, and last model - Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite is very-very good!"
1,Good over all i had competitors sreaming devices and none were as good as this i would recommend to buy
1,I think this is a great tablet. I bought 3 of them. You can't beat this for the price.
1,Love this tablet. Easy to use. And price was right
1,I wish it was designed to do a few more commands. It is modtly geared toward Amazon products and services.
1,Great gift idea and reasonably priced. Love the alexa feature
1,Great product and so affordable...easy to operate and download programs.
1,"I'm an apple guy, but got this tablet because I'm a prime member and the price was right. Works fine, but I think the iPad is easier to use."
1,Had the original kindle and didn't use it as much as this one. Love the convenience of being able to pick it up anytime no matter where I am and use it without having to worry about the lighting conditions of where I am.
1,Very satisfied with this purchase! If you have a doubt Alexa will get you an answer.
1,This device is easy to use and I like it very much.
1,"After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
1,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Originally I thought of the idea for her to read on so she could make the font larger, but now she is using it for so many other things. She is a happy mom"
1,This is a major upgrade from the fire stick. Works extremely well no lag. Would definitely recommend to anyone that has Amazon prime.
1,"Works like a charm, just what I was looking for."
1,Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
1,Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
1,Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
1,Handy device to have near family rm and kitchen. Great timer for cooking and excellent speaker for any kind of music.
0,"The product is good for children. The downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. If you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless."
0,I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
1,I bought this tablet for my 9 year old sister as a birthday present. It is decent but not as good as other tablets on the market. I recommend it for first time users or light tablet users.
1,"I love the voice control, that was the main reason for the purchase. Works awesome if you have Amazon Prime Music. The sound quality is good, although if that's the most important feature to you, there are better speakers out there."
1,I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids
1,"The amazon Echo can be a bit finicky when asking Alexa to perform automation routines. for example, most of the time you must ask for a light by the exact name it has been given. You can't say turn on my Middle Theater Lights, if you named them Mid Theater Lights, whereas my Google home assistant can identify these are the same device. Hence, my Echo gets to hear me swear frequently.The sound is nice and rich, unlike the Echo Dot that sounds a bit cell phone'ish."
0,When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
1,This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
1,"After ranting against e-readers for years, I decided that I could use one for the long bus trips into and back from work. Tablets gave me eyestrain, and one of my brothers (who happened to have the same problem with tablet-reading) suggested doing what he did and getting a Paperwhite.This thing is amazing! I am now a firm believer! The simplicity of its controls, the portability, and Best Buy's 2-year extended warranty have made this something I ALWAYS carry with me!"
1,Nothing all that special but does exactly what you want it to. Very easy to set up and use.
1,We love this product. It can do so many things and the sound quality from it is quite good.
1,Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
1,Just now got it activated. Looks good for now.......
1,Same as other tablet just has blue back witch i have not seen before in colors works really good
1,"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker."
1,Easy to set up and use. I bought this for my five year old son.
1,"Bought these for my kids worth every penny!! With the micro Sd slot I was able to fill it with movie upon movie for a 1000 mile road trip, these were a god send for the kids"
1,"Very user friendly no issues, very easy to setup. I"
1,"Got one for each of my kids. They use it to play games, watch movies, read and do homework"
1,Great mini portable smart stereo for a beginner! Sitting in my hot tub listening to free Pandora. Alexa controls my Hue Go lighting. Also portable. Cant wait to get the Hue Bloom for the back porch too. These are my relaxation toys to wind down with on the back porch at the end of a long day. I also use Alexa in the house. She controls lighting in the bedrooms and kitchen and Im increasingly learning more about her. She gives me my daily flash briefing of the news. She answers questions like who sang that song and so on. Lots of FUN!
1,"This Fire Tv box is great. Bye bye cable, hello savings. I'm glad I purchased this item."
1,"I gave this as a gift to another and got it back. I use it for fb and web, also, reading and Alexa. Can't be read in the sun."
1,Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips
0,"Very hard to set up child profile without paying for a subscription to freetime. Once I got it finally set up though, runs smoothly, but battery doesn't seem to last very long."
1,Bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it.
1,Device is smooth running and streams content seamlessly. More advanced settings and GUI smoothing is needed. Runs KODI extremely well.
1,I'm really enjoying my amazon fire tv. I should have bought it a long time ago. Alexa is a very cool feature.
1,"It is not the greatest tablet I've used, but it is by far the best value for the money."
0,"I found the Fire TV to be a good box for streaming, but not great. Two things that stood out is the low internal drive space and so so speed.I would recommend it, with a clear understanding of the short falls."
1,This thing works great. I highly recommend it. Good price on sale.
1,Bought for my wife. She seems to love it. Links to Internet and phone very easy. Easily understands voices from multiple people with different accents. Turns kitchen into an instant dance floor during cooking.
1,"Good screen resolution, very handy, easy to operate, compact; great reading device"
1,"I love this product, is excellent for my 4K video streaming. Really easy to use and a great price."
1,After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It's the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday!
1,Had bought 2 Fire sticks and decided to get the fire tv box to get more space to download movies and games.
1,My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
1,"Fun to play With. Smart and innovative, great deal after thanksgiving."
1,"We use it for lots of things. The shopping list is wonderful- anyone in the house can no add something to the list as soon as they finish the last item and it is sent right to my phone. The to-do list keeps us on track. The music option, combined with Amazon Prime Music, is awesome! We use Alexa every day. We even play pranks on each other! I love to have Alexa tell my husband a bedtime store about himself. We laugh every time. The kids and hubby will send notes to my to-do list like ""Be sure to buy your daughter the new video game she wants!"" Very user friendly. Two things we would like changed- the pause between when you say Alexa and when you can say what you want is too long. I also wish there was to make an intercom out of multiple units. We have a dot upstairs would love to be able to project my voice from one to the other rather than yelling to the kids or going upstairs. :)"
1,I now have 5 Amazon Echo Units. Can't get enough of them. GREAT...!
1,I have kodi installed and this box works wonders if you don't have one get one
0,This doesn't have the ability to control volume or turn off and on the tv. Liked the programming didn't like the features.
1,Exactly as described
1,"Great tablet for the money, especially after you put the Google Play store app on it(see xda forums for instructions on how)"
1,I bought this for the ease of downloading for travel this is amazing I would recommend this
1,This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.
1,This is a great beginner tablet for a small children. Definitely recommend this starter tablet.
0,goes with the kindle for charging port
1,The Echo is a great little portable speaker with many uses.
1,It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
1,I would give this tablet great recommendations for anyone to buy it. We purchased for family members in Mexico and they love i. Easy to use. Great buy.
1,I would tell everyone ik to get this. U can format it however u like to. Very easy to understand.
1,"I've been contemplating on expanding into a smart home for quite some time, and getting the Echo was a great first step. I hope to get pretty good at it's functions. It's easy to use, recognizes my voice very well and pretty much does what I ask."
1,Great love that I can monitor the time used in certain things
1,It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
1,Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.
1,"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one."
1,Excellent product. Good Price and a good buy for the entertainment.Will recommend to others.
1,This reader is great for consuming your digital media on the go. With a few tweaks it is quite a function tablet for cheap.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my wife who in the past said she would never use a Kindle. Since getting one, she uses it any spare moment that she has. It is convenient to take on trips, easy to use, and can be read in low lit areas. The antiglare screen is great when used outdoors or in brightly lit locations."
1,"The fire tablet works great for what I use it for, games, email, buying, entertainment."
1,I got this for running kodi and it does the job much better than the stick. Definitely worth the extra. Much faster and the Alexia on the remote is awesome.
1,Such a great deal for a great product!!!! My 69 year old mother loves this!!!
1,This is a great reader. As a tablet it will not replace my iPad
1,"First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!"
1,The kid really love this kindle fire. The protection for the kindle help protect the kindle
1,Christmas present for the spouse which she asked for. Happy wife equals happy life.
1,Daughter love it can download all her app good battery
1,I wanted an inexpensive tablet that would allow me to surf the web and this was perfect! On top of it there are many other features that could be useful but you can't go wrong if you're just looking for the basics so purchase and enjoy.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for a special needs child, he was able to use mine with ease so I bought his his own. Best Buy carries amazing covers as well and he is now able to listen to music, learn colors and numbers, and access movies in a fun interactive way. This is an amazing purchase for the price."
1,It works great for what I need. Not a fan of ads and that it sends e-mails of all the apps I download. But I just use it for a few apps.
0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
1,I brought this for my 3YR OLD and she loves it. It'd very easy for her to use.
1,I love listening to music and awesome tell play certain radio stations or music to enjoy as I work. Took a little getting used to know how phase questions to get Alexa to answer but we are both are pro now. :)
1,very easy to work the only thing i dont like the cord does not plug in good its like it not the cord for it
1,I love everything about my fire tv. I wish I wouldve gotten one sooner!
1,Easy to use for all kids. My daughter so happy to play her favorite games
1,"have purchased 4-5 tablets in my life, always Samsung or Apple, my first experience with an Amazon tablet, very happy with my purchase"
1,"Bought the voice fire stick, that is a nice feature. The ease of navigation in the apps is nice because of the streamlined interface. I am happy with the buy."
1,Purchased as a gift. They love it and I loved the price. Lower than Amazon!
1,"This device destroyed the competition with Google home side by side, so now I have virtually my entire apt connected via Alexa.Such an awesome investment."
1,Our technology and innovation are great and this device is a great tool to make life easier.
0,I love it. Will definitely recommend it to a friend.
1,"nice, compact, shipped in the mail. works well with supplied kindle cord."
1,It is more lightweight than my keyboard kindle 3. Love it
1,Another good buy for my daughter! Youngest one too! She enjoys being on it!!
1,I love my echo! I use it to listen to music and the timer the most. Its nice to get the weather and to use it w/ the Hue Lights to cut lights off and on. My daughter loves the tell a joke feature.
1,"Excellent -- has quickly become an invaluable feature of our house. Voice recognition, even from a distance, is very good."
1,This thing is used everday. I had this guy Vincent program it with cody.he has been doing this for several years. Cable channels movies just like my direct Tv.
1,Really good for KIDS use kids lock so they don't see what the don't suppose to see love this
1,They love it and when they are here that's all they want to do but I do limit their time on it.
1,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my kids on their birthdays. Very easy to set up and use. Also very easy to use and monitor the kids usage and controls to what they download and watch. Great part is anytime they download something, an email is sent to the parent notifying them what was downloaded."
1,"Very easy to set up and operate. The voice command is especially nice when playing music and so far I've found the music library to be quite large with a good selection. If you use Amazon at all I would recommend the Prime membership as it pays for itself quickly and drastically increases the available content in the media libraries. No, I'm not an Amazon employee :)"
1,"""Alexa"" Amazon Echo is the perfect personal assistant. From ""to do"" lists to music, alarms and so much more. I have it on my night stand and the plan was to eventually put it in the kitchen for the family to use, but no!........., she's mine! My wife is so jealous, lol. But seriously, great device, lots of fun and very useful."
0,"Alexa is tall, slim and attractive but too jealous to use Google and that makes her rather dumb. And she is just a shill for Amazon prime. Dropping the personification, music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time. The database Amazon Echo draws from is very limited: Alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common woman's shoe size is; what Serena Williams' age is but not how many guns Ruger sold last year. Stand by for more tech-savvy companies to take the Echo concept to maturity."
1,Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
1,The kindle is a great alternative to buying so many books. I bought my kindle and have over 100 books to read at any time. The new kindle lets me read at night without any other lighting.
1,Easy to set up. Fun to use. Working toward whole house automation.
1,I would recommend this to anyone it is a great deal and it has a great screen
1,"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
1,"Where do I begin? It comes with an amazing thick case, it's a fully functioning tablet. It also comes with a one year subscription to educational games and movies/ shows. If it breaks Amazon replaces! How could you choose any other tablet? This was so great we had to get two!"
1,"Our Amazon Echo is another step toward making life easier. As a senior member of society, sitting back and having a ""conversation"" to learn about news, time, weather, etc. is even easier than finding the remote. Relaxing with music I can just ""request"" is always a good deal. And, not to mention the potential for the summoning of medical services in emergency situations. A great investment."
1,Great sound. Awesome product. Loved it from the moment it came out.
1,Alexa is very understanding and knows how to please
1,"I like being able to add to a shopping list the moment I think of an item I need, purchased smart outlets and can run lights & small appliances too"
1,My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.
1,"This was neat at first, when I could stream music and goof around with it. Once I delved into the smart home controls, this went from neat to amazing. I can now tell Alexa Go to Bed and the lights downstairs go out, the TV goes off, the door locks and it can even adjust the thermostat. This is truly the easiest home automation device out there!"
0,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
1,"This was the perfect choice for travelling. It's very light and very clear, easy to read screen"
1,I purchased this tablet and have been pleasantly surprised how simple it is to use. Very user friendly and have not one complaint!
1,Absolute best for kids. Bought three for ages toddler to teen and it's perfect for each.
1,"I was a little concerned about the advertised display resolution, but it's good enough for my uses. It's not as sharp as a lot of the other tablets on the market, but it only cost $50. That makes it so I'm not so concerned if it gets broken or lost. I've watched some videos on it and the display seems fine. Mostly I use it to read e-mails and surf the web. As this is my first tablet, I'm still learning about its capabilities and limitations. I've taken only a few photos on it and it is not as sharp as a lot of other phone/tablet cameras, but still serviceable."
1,Have only had it a week but enjoy all the things it can do.
1,"Great Device. We use it in the kids room where we don't have a Sonos Speaker. I works well and my 3 yo is able to command and receive a response. The sound is ok for playing her lullabies and kid songs as well. When getting her dressed, I can find out about the weather and my commute without missing a beat. I have the remote also. It allows me to use the baby monitor and turn off the lights in her room from afar. Wonderful and is very entertaining! More Apps please amazon."
1,It took a bit for me to get used to the Kindle as I was used to reading the books on my phone with the Kindle app. I was a bit bummed with losing the color. I also don‚Äôt like that it has no sound. Other than that it's a nice lightweight device with a good battery life. At first I thought it was defective because it froze up the first time I plugged in the usb. It actually stayed frozen for a couple days before it finally started working again.
1,I love my Kindle Voyage.... it's light and oh so easy to use... it's wonderful to have so many books in a portable format!
0,Bought the fire TV excited about the 4K support. The first night it refused to load video content. I could only stream music. Now it refuses to load at all. It has completely stopped responding to the remote. Remote feels cheap.
1,My new Fire tablet is easy to navigate I have had two other brands and my fire is the best .
1,nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
1,"i am happy with my purchase of alexa, it is user friendly aand easy to learn i also find it convienient and time saveing in its ability to adapt, has some quirks but nothing major overall a joy toown and use."
1,"This is my third Kindle & each one has been excellent. My most recent purchase was the Paperwhite because of the built in light. I really enjoy reading with, especially in dark places."
1,"This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps"
1,"Had been using a normal tablet to read for quite a while, but really do prefer e-ink to an LCD screen. Very light and small so makes it easy to travel with."
0,I purchased this as a after thought. The tablet has 8gb but from the moment you start to use it almost five is already used by Amazon I was totally disappointed. I love how the screen savers changed though it was so clear and unique but the memory took the cake for me!
1,"Pretty cool piece of technology- very smart and fairly easy to use. Definitely recommend as a gift. I haven't fully learned the capabilities yet, but try new things each day. Works really well and she understands everything. Sometimes she talks when you don't say her name, so that can be weird."
1,"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options"
1,This was the best thing to happen for me and my family with the way you can set up the kid mode is awesome and the overall functionality of it is very easy
1,great product--exceeded expectations. Love the paper white screen
1,"Cool little tablet. Does what you would expect a tablet would do. Screen quality isn't the greatest, but you get what you pay for."
1,Got it for the kids great find just the best first tablet
1,Perfect gift for my wife and I use it too! It's so easy on the eyes. It's like reading paper but the luxury of technology. Will be getting one for me soon!
1,"Great product, fun to use, and brings all tech together in the house"
1,The Fire is a perfect tablet and reader. you can't beat the price.
1,my son loves it. I have bought him tablets before but he never liked them as much. this one is easier to use.
1,Nice for my daughter good product reliable easy Carrington convenient
1,"So with that said, I cannot complain. I purchased this so I could have something inexpensive, small and could throw in my purse or pocket to read school books on the go. I own an iPad Air 2. I paid $450 for that, so it's not fair to compare the two.Of course Amazon doesn't have the apps that Apple has. If you're looking for something to read books on, but to be able to hop online from time to time on a screen bigger than a smartphone, this is it.The screen resolution isn't top of the line, the audio isn't great, but you can watch Amazon video, youtube and other streaming services on this table.If you know the capabilities of this tablet, then you won't have your expectations set too high. With that said, comparing this to any other $49 tablet, this wins. With the low-end cost of this, if I had the finances, I'd find an under privileged school district and buy these for them. The features of setting these up for educational time for kids is great. If you haven't already exposed your kid to iPads, I'd recommend one of these.I think the Fire would also be good for someone who isn't a techy. I don't even consider the camera on this. They could have left that off of the device, but I suppose if you purchase one of these for grandma, she can use it to skype the grandkids. I just see a lot of possibility for this because of the features and cost."
1,for $50 this tab does what it is supposed to do. It has the gaming apps and social networking apps. You can take photos and videos. Its like a poor man's ipad.
1,BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT
1,Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
1,"Amazon - Echo - White is a powerful and versatile product. BestBuy had the best price available for this product, at the time of my purchase."
1,The Amazon Fire is a great device and for a great price! This new device now has a camera where as our older version did not!
1,easy to be understood and the color is a nice arctic white
1,I got 1 for myself after the kids got them for Christmas and I can check up on them and see what they are doing and set parental controls fairly easily
1,Absolutely love the fire Tv. I first purchased the fire stick which does just what it should but the fire Tv is awesome. Faster bigger.
0,"It does everything that much more expensive products do, but it is much, much slower when changing apps. Once using the app, the very slow speed is no longer an issue."
1,I like this Fire...First time...love the books and apps
1,This speaker sound great. I was surprised at how loud it gets. The sound is clear and you also have Alexa so that's a win.
1,Reasonable price yet love it my kids loves itttttt
1,I purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. It's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.
1,"I bought my wife a Paperwhite a couple of years ago while I did much of my reading on my iPad. She loved the Paperwhite and I didn't know what I was missing out on. Don't get me wrong, I love my iPad, it's just that it wasn't designed to be only a reader. Now that I have a Paperwhite of my own, reading has become even more enjoyable than it was on my iPad, and I can't think of one negative thing to say about my purchase."
1,"The echo is a really fun, handy device to have around. I always start my day with ""Alexa...good morning"" for a fun fact about the day. My wife and I use her in conjunction with our philips hue lights and nest thermostat which makes you really feel like you have a ""smart home"". Asking questions and taking advantage of prime music are a few additional things we use Alexa for on a regular basis. Overall I think, as long as you purchase the echo when it's on sale, it's a worthy investment, especially if you have other connected devices, but it's not an essential device that you can't live without."
1,Just like having another member of the family but it listens much better than any of my children ever did (LOL)
1,"With skills too numerous to count, and more being added all of the time, the Amazon Echo is the most useful and used electronic in my house. The sound quality is excellent. Alexa always answers when I call, does what I ask, is always pleasant, and never asks for money! My new best friend!"
1,Easy to use at any age level. Should of got another one
1,Not as smart as Google but it's nice. Wife is jealous
0,"You get what you pay for. A small tablet, with OK specs. What was annoying about this tablet was the fact that you have to pay to remove ""offers."" You shouldn't have to pay to remove bloatware."
1,Alexa is pretty awesome and the speaker really bumps!
0,You get what you pay for. Definitely not an iPad but they work great for our kids
1,"But you do get what you pay for. Charging cable doesn't work anymore and charging port is messed up. Other than that, good device."
1,This product is great! It is great for those that enjoy using it for reading but also for entertainment. It is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show.
1,This is a good product for the price easy for kids to use
1,"I really like my Amazon Fire Tablet, it's easy to use."
1,Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
1,The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. It works so much better than my Apple TV and I am a huge Apple fan
1,Took a bit of time but I figured how to get the most out out using Alexa and luv it.
1,Bright backlight- amazing controls + Kindle features
1,"I enjoy watching free movies, playing great games, and listening to the various music stations."
1,"We don't have the best wifi in our house which caused the firestick to continually buffer. Since getting the fire tv we almost never have buffering, it's quicker and much more reliable."
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is a great e-reader. It is light and easy on the eyes.I like that not only is it easy to find and get books from Amazon but also from my public library.
1,Bought this for my nieces and nephews and they love it. Parental controls are easy to set.
1,"For the money this is an exceptional value. Not the best tablet out there but it is the ""best"" for the money!"
1,My kids love the kindle. It was their favorite Christmas present.
1,"This is just the right size for someone who doesn't want to always use their phone while on the go. Must have wifi but that's not a problem. The response to the touch isn't bad at all. It isn't an iPad but it does the job fo rmusic, books, youtube, facebook and other small applications."
1,Good product and excited to use it bought some for our kids
1,"I very much enjoy my echo. Easy news and weather blasts. Music ,games and trivia. But it can be difficult to get apps to work. Overall very happy with my purchase and enjoy interacting with alexa."
0,"I bought this hoping to get a responsive android streamer, but was disappointed with the performance and the ""4k"" that was somewhat limited. I decided to return this and get an Nvidia Shield, which offers more value, instead."
1,We decided to cut our cable bill and start using streaming devices instead. The Fire has been great. The only problem is finding time to watch all the stuff we put in our watch list.
1,I enjoy Alexa's ability to sit in the kitchen and play music at the sound of my voice. She is also capable of many things after setup. I do wish she could search Google though when she does not know an answer.
1,I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
1,This fire has a lot more options than the previous one I had purchased
1,I bought this as a gift for my wife for college and she practically lives on it and even does her homework on it! She said that it saved her when her laptop died and needed to be able to complete her school work .... if she's happy I'm happy.
1,Bout this for my step-son. Easy to use and durable.
1,I like the fire tv because it's easy to use and I can get all my services in one box. I also like the voice control feature and the included games. The thing I dont like is that sometimes the cache gets full and the stream starts to cuts even with my 100M conection. A faster dual or quad core procesor with more memory would be great.
1,This was easy to set up and use. It is an excellent product for Amazon Prime members. We have cancelled our satellite subscription since purchasing the Amazon Fire TV.
1,Love the back lit screen for reading in all sorts of lighting situations.
1,Very easy to use and more reliable than cable tv. After set up by a friend it's all I use.
1,"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift."
1,This is my second Kindle. Tried using a tablet and that didn't work. Glad I went back to a Kindle.
1,I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
1,Great addition to our home. It's like having your very own virtual assistant.
1,Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things .
1,Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
1,Easy to use. Would recommend the Kindle Fire for any age person.
1,Awesome gift for the price... Small enough tobe carried around everywhere..
1,Bought this tablet as a gift for my grandfather for Christmas and he loves it! Very user friendly! It's also lightweight and easy to travel with.
1,My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
1,Perfect device for gaming apps and on-the-go streaming!
1,"Love this player, I have purchased 3 already and will put one in each room. The quad core processor is very good"
1,Works well. A nice upgrade from our old one. Easy to use
1,Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
1,"Great little reader, long battery life, light weight, easy on the eyes, I use it at the gym."
1,"You can use this for reading, surfing the net, taking pictures. The best deal and product you can get for near nothing. I bought 10 and have them to my now best friends."
1,For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
1,The echo works great. Every Day I find out more things to use it for.The sound is great for the size. I bought another one for the garage.
1,Got this for our daughter for xmas. It's small enough for a child and easy to use.
0,Small and lightweight. I wouldn't really recommend for teenagers or adults more so for kids under 10
1,I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games
1,Got my Kindle to play games. Has a lot more that you can do with it. Was easy to set up.
1,No disappointment for this Amazon Echo!Great product!
1,The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet.
1,"So this is more than just another electronic gadget. First the sound from the echo is way above average, not Sono's but not far off. Second is the ability you will have to make your home a ""smart"" home. Echo will be able to control your lights, plugs, thermostat, garage door, sprinkler system etc. some of the random features are fun like "" tell me a joke"" or sing happy birthday or what is the weather like in DubaiWell worth the price."
1,This tablet is great for the price. Gets everything done quick and easy
1,"She recognizes the commands they say she will recognize, however you either have to scream at her, very loudly, or being very nearby if you want her to hear your commands"
1,"I love my Amazon tv box! I love that I can plug an Ethernet cable directly into it. I love that my movies don't buffer. And I love Alexa, she does so much."
1,The box gives you everything Fire TV Stick does and A lot more. Expandable SD storage and USB storage. Both can be used for more apps or your personal videos. Also connect gaming controllers. PS4 controller works great.
1,"Love my Amazon Echo, the white looks good in my kitchen. Great speakers, play music all the time. Use the timer feature daily, also alarm ,shopping lists, and reminders. Wish I had one in every room!!!"
0,"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice..."
1,I bought about 5 tablets before. This is the best tablets I ever bought.
1,I purchased this as a replacement for my mom's old Kindle which was several years old.
1,"I bought this for my 80- year old mother. She loves to read books but has difficulty getting to the store. This was a perfect gift for her though it did take some time explaining how to use it. It isn't the easiest device to use but now that she knows how to download books, she loves it!"
1,It is extremely handy and easy to use. The library of books available on Amazon is extensive. The ability to have a device that can hold hundred of book in the palm of your hand is unparalleled.
1,Bought these for my kids and just love them. The different color choices give it a nice personalized touch.
1,Would highly recommend and Great product with great sound
1,The Fire TV box works great. We were looking for a device that streams DirecTV Now and this device was significantly less than a competing device that offered the service. We liked the first one so much we bought a second one.
1,A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
1,Awesome gadget plays music answers questions tells the time.
1,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.
1,The tablet is good for a child between the ages of 5-18. Great purchase!
1,Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
1,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.
1,"Love having hands free while in the kitchen. Didn't think I'd like it as much as I do, use it all the time. Sometimes it doesn't understand a command such as ""play polka music"" but if you are more specific, naming the artist, it works. It does recognize generas, just not polkas LOL."
1,"Like the screen,easier to read.happy that we bought it"
1,I first boughy alezxa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking
1,"I bought this to have some extra features and compared it to my roku sticks and roku 2,3 and 4. I prefer the roku for netflix and the roku for many maybe more use friendly. However if you are looking for something that can do it all with more capabilities and features the Fire TV wins. I am amazed at what I can do with this little box. If you have not tried one do so."
1,Excellent product at a great price! Perfect for my little boy
1,You can't go wrong when you get an amazon product. I got this particular tablet for my 3 year old daughter and she simply loves it. She navigates on it alone with ease.
1,I bought this Kndle for my daughter who is vision impaired. I was able to increase the size of the print enough that she could read without a magnifying glass. She hadn't been able to read a book for many years so she was thrilled. It's also great that she is able to read with no glare on the screen if she is outside. Great product!
1,Hello I got this product for my daughter and she loves it. Best Tablet under $50.
1,"Affordable, versatile and easy to use whether it is for e-reading or searching the web."
1,"I use my Amazon fire tablet to allocate kids to watch TV through my TWC app, as well as to download and stream music. If you are a heavy Amazon user this app is perfect for you. Holds charge for a decent amount of time as well."
1,I love this item and it's easy to use. I bought 2 of this already. Great gift also for your love ones.
1,Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times.
1,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too."
1,We love it. it is not uncommon to start up and let it go for several hours. It can play a very wide genre of music. ( That is what we primarily bought it for>)
1,For the cost of this tablet it is amazing. You can upgrade the storage via a microSD card so you won't run out of room. The Amazon version of android is easy to navigate and if you have a prime membership can't be beat.
1,"The Paperwhite is an excellent eReader. It's easy to use, has good battery power and is a good weight and size."
1,I have one of these already I bought this one for my cousin for Christmas she loves it.. is now able to watch Netflix and the like without having to fight her daughter and husband for the TV..
1,my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the books for school & screen size is prefect
1,Bought for my 4 yr old. ...great Tablet for his age. ..love the aps
1,Easy to download books. Easy to use. Easy on the eyes when reading. Can read anywhere in any light--even in the sun! Passed my old one on to a family member. Love this Kindle !
1,"I bought the echo after I used it at a friends house, we have a large family so the echo gets used alot and moved around alot, its a huge favorite of everyones"
1,This is my second KIndle. I use Kindle to read fictions. This is awesome!
1,I'm a big fan of Kindle tablets so i got one for all the kids for christmas
0,It is agood tablet for beginner kids and great for the price
1,There is only 1 e-reader that I like better. Kindle unlimited makes this e-reader great for avid readers.
1,Alexa rocks! Knows everything! Never talks back! A perfect roommate!
1,"If you are as invested into the Amazon ecosystem as I am, you can never have too many of these."
1,"I Love(d) it. I did return it for a Roku. Not for the product quality. I really Liked the Fire TV, the only downfall was the lack of TV Apps that would work with my Cable subscriber. I did have 1 issue with it over heating, After talking with Amazon i could not leave the unit on top of my cable box due to the heat form that unit."
0,Got this on sale during Black Friday. Great little tablet for the price. It isn't fast but gets the job done.
1,"I love my new kindle. I bought one earlier this summer for myself and just recently for my ten year old. One function that is awesome is its ability to work with the audible application. I can read on my kindle then audible will pick up where I left off, so I can continue with the read during my commute. My kindle will then propose to move my place to where I left off in audible. It has made my commute very purposeful because I am able to read literature for work a lot more efficiently. This may have been one of the smartest purchases I have ever made for professional development!"

1,Very happy with my purchase. Streams everything I need it too with no hesitation.
1,Love the sound quality and knowledge of ALEXA. The whole family really likes the way you ask Alexa questions and the answers she gives!. The choice of music knows no end. We play games and listen to the music day in and day out. Really love the Echo!
1,I bought this kindle paperwhite especially for reading on the beach and have tried it in bright sun and it is amazing

1,I brought it for my grandson. He enjoying his tablet

0,"Please support commands for the Energysmart Water Heater Controller by Iris. Lowes Item# 612026 Model:691121 . Command such as ""alexa turn water heater on"" or ""alexa turn water heater off"" would be nice. It would gave been nice if Amazon has added a command support for this water heater controller by Iris."
0,Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.
1,I wish they really would make a phone with this wait I believe they are. Huawei
1,It is awesome and my grandboy loves it. It keeps him from playing with my phone.
1,A tablet that is not too large with great clarity!
1,Love listening to a variety of music. Alarm setting is great
1,The capabilities of this product are absolutely amazing. I truly only wish that it could integrated with other product lines such as Google based products.
0,"This tablet is useful if you have prime and invest in the Amazon ecosystem. I prefer my other Android tablets more, but for the price I paid for this one it was a great deal."
1,This kindle paper white has a built in light and it helps a lot when you are reading especially at night.
1,"Love the Paperwhite, easy to read in any light, easy to carry."
1,Couldn't ask for a better tablet to read with. Does exactly what is says. I have kindle unlimited and read all the time. Battery life is excellent
1,"Purchased this for my wife and ended up using it myself...now I have to buy s second unit. Integrating with other ""smart"" devices gets easier as your do them...good buy regardless but a steal when on sale."
1,It's a great tablet. it does lots of things. It works great with school work.
1,i would buy this item again. however charging port is
1,My son really enjoys this tablet. It's easy to navigate
1,The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
1,Not only do we love the echo the kids can't get enough of the games offered!!
1,"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend."
1,We keep trying to find songs she doesn't have and only found a couple.
0,I am glad I bought it. It is easy to use and have given me good book suggestions.
1,I enjoy the product. It was easy to program. My toddler pushed a button that changed the setting. I took the product to the store and the kind salesman corrected the product.
1,"I use the email, search, and read books primarily. My fingertips are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve! I forget how to access some things but ask those who know. The Kindle Fire can do so many things for the modest price. I just need to keep at it!"
1,We open the box. We download a book. It's like magic. The words the phrases the complete sentences. So cool!!!
1,"Speaker is really cool. Sounds great, easy to use. Love the fact that it is portable. Only downside I see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button (not always listening)"
1,"We are having a lot of fun with the Echo. Purchased for my boyfriend for Christmas. We've bought a couple of the smart outlets, and it's very convenient to say ""Gameroom on"" and have the lights and fireplace all come on without having to turn everything on, as our hands are often full when entering the gameroom. Also have it connected to Fitbit, so if I don't have my phone and the Fitbit is charging, I can just ask how I'm doing. Good weather reports and news briefs, and the best part is you can just say, ""Stop"" when you don't want to hear any more. Convenient saying aloud an item for a grocery or to-do list, then having it on your phone when you get to the store. We've also enjoyed the music (have it connected to speakers in the living room). Only drawback is it can't answer a lot of things. One example, I asked when the new Bladerunner was going to come out, and it could only give me info on the original show."
1,"I ordered this tablet as a cheap replacement for my niece, but quickly found out how well made the tablet is. Not only that the version of android it uses is smoother than i expected. Nice tablet."
1,"this is a good one, easy to read and browsethis is a good one, easy to read and browse"
1,This kindle was purchased for my mother. She took to the kindle with ease. She was able to navigate through the device without any problems. She is very happy with her kindle.
1,The fire was a good size. Good image easy to setup. It was what I wanted. Ads popup every time you start it but not a big deal to ignore them
1,Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
1,"I love the Kindle fire. I have a nook from a few years ago and the Kindle has so much more. Very user-friendly, great price!"
1,We are so happy with the fire stick! Our friends kept telling us to get one and I don't know why we waited so long!
1,Good product for the price. Obviously it is not as simple to use as iPad or galaxy but still a great option for those who don't want to break the bank
1,"Bought as a birthday present for my GF. She uses it daily, and loves it.Easy to use, and convenient for those who are afraid to go full touch screen(they prefer buttons)."
1,My granddaughter is enjoying it thoroughly. My son likes the various parental controls
1,"Just bought a my first house and this was a fantastic addition as I unpack. I have an Amazon Prime account which gives me amazon music, so I've just been requesting music as I unpack and clean. Solid"
1,The FireTV box is a great device to help with cutting cable. It has 4K streaming and all the apps you need to watch movies and tv on the device or you can download them. You can install side load and install android apps on this as well. I would recommend one to anyone.
0,I purchased this tablet for my sister as a Christmas present.
1,"Overall, this is a far cry from the more popular iPad, and is nowhere near as intuitive or easy to use, but as a less expensive option for my children to learn on it is the perfect fit. The price point is perfect for first time tablet users, though you will surely need to invest in a memory card to expand the storage capacity."
1,It's like having the world in the palm of your hand it really is .it does everything you need it to do AND fits in your pockets AND when you hold it the balance is so perfect it's like holding a baby. I highly recommend for the times when your lap top is just too much
1,The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!
1,Plugged it in and it found my network easily. My server is on the second floor and have no speed issues. Much faster than my Apple TV older version and the Roku 2 paper weight that was always my network problem....
1,Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
1,The Amazon fire is a great inexpensive tablet. I only wish that it had a more true version of Android. There are some games and apps that won't work on the fire because of how much Amazon has changed the Android OS.
1,Bought this for my girlfriend for a replacement for her old kindle. Easy to set up. She likes that it is slim. she loves it.
1,Love my fire tv. Much better and faster than the fire stick.
1,I love it. Works great for what I purchased it for
1,This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
1,"Got this for a Christmas gift for a friend. She loves it! No issues with product, software or quality."
1,"The table is great she use it to plsy games, read books and watch youtube."
1,its a nice tablet for the basic uses i need it for such as apple tv and killing time with games.
1,"I had a problem with my Kindle not charging, Turns out I needed a new charger and cable. Everything is perfect now. Thank you Amazon for great customer service and for providing me with the charger and cable. Your support representatives are excellent."
1,i Haven't used by new kindle very much yet. You need 50 characters. I don't have that much to say.
1,Has options to add a scard that increases the low memory constraints on stick. Overall good
1,"I tried apple tv, chrome tv, Roku but I like this the best."
1,"Price was right, great tablet for playing games and reading"
1,"I bought these for my nieces for Christmas because their older version Kindle Fires did not have a storage slot and they were complaining that they had to delete things off of them in order to use them. I keep getting huge ""thank yous"" from them every time I see them. They are so thrilled to have them and be able to use them without deleting anything."
1,"This is my third Kindle reader and I love it as much as I loved the others! Light and comfortable to hold, especially in bed."
1,"Bigger screen, longer battery life and faster loading...an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet. As a college student, it beats spending more on books and having to lug the extra weight on my back"
1,Alexa could hear me from across the room and worked well for playing music but I think you need a lot of smart home devices to make the purchase worth it.
1,Very easy to set up and easy to use. Touch screen response is great. This is my first tablet and I am very pleased. There are lots of available Apps.
1,This an amazing device. Must have for prime members
1,works very well.. i was able to sideload kodi and along with amazon video and netflix fulfills all of my streaming needs.
1,"Easy to setup and use. I gave this as a gift to a 13 year old. % minutes later, she and the books loaded and started to read."
1,I love this product for my 7 year old. Its fast and has parental controls. Great product for an amazing price.
1,"great tablet, we love it, great for family with kids"
1,Works as advertisedSound from a small unit is very good
1,"For 48"" the price paid was excellent. The only con is that it isn't a smart tv. But it is 1080 HD. Would recommend."
1,The kindle was bought for my grandchildren that also have iPads. I don't have to worry so much about them breaking it and being out all the money for an iPad.
1,Very good product especially if you are into high end hq tv products fast easy to operate
1,"I love electronics and thought the Kindle would be nice but certainly not something I needed. It is a reading game changer. It is so easy to take with me, holds a charge for such a long time, but the best part of all is how comfortable it makes reading. My eyes are never strained, I can read in bright sunshine or a deep dark cave. Being an Audible customer, I can switch back and forth from listening to reading and the Paperwhite always keeps my place, it is just amazing!"
1,I wanted a Bluetooth speaker I am glad I got this....i like playing the games and asking it questions.
1,"Well, since I have to use up at least sixty characters in this review, I can say it woks."
1,I am able to stream movies without any buffering issues and the voice command makes searching for shows very easy.
1,"Wish the Amazon fire had more connections, i.e. Optical option."
1,"Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!"
0,Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
1,Enjoy not having to look up everything on the internet or my phone. Unique. Haven't learned all it can do yet. Interesting.
1,The voyage is so much easier on the eyes. The size is great and easy to carry in a briefcase for travel purposes.
1,The fire tv works well with ethernet. Not so much with wifi
1,Easy to use. Easy to download games. Kids love the color options.great for school work.
1,Purchased it for my son. He loves it and it is easy to use. Great deal too!
1,Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
1,I would recommend it to all my family very happy with this item.
1,"I absolutely love the Echo. I use it as part of my smart home set up and Alexa keeps me up to date with my appointments, weather and even traffic when I am about to leave for work. Glad I made this purchase."
1,"I love apple products but I'm a jailbreaker and unfortunately you can't jb the latest apple tv but amazon made things so much easier with the fire tv,especially when you can add more memory!"
1,Easy and fun to use. Nice to be able to now read e-books.
1,User friendly with so many more features than my older kindle. Love all the color choices and now I can read in the dark next to my sleeping husband!
1,"Bought this for my daughter to play learning games on and to watch movies on in the car. It is great!!! It was easy to setup a kids account so I could limit what she had access too, and I got to pick what she could see! Great features for all the family!"
1,This is a great product and I love listening to music on it. The sound is very good and when I want to listen to just one person I can. It plays that artist continually.
1,"I've tried Apple TV, chromecast, original fire stick and I love this one the best. Easy to use and setup, voice search is nice. Much better if you have add on products like Netflix Hulu or kodi. Only beef is the poor content selection from Amazon."
1,Gave this as a Christmas gift to my uncle because he has been given other tablets that did perform as they advertised. I have asked him several time if he is still enjoying the Fire and his answer has always been yes. I also purchased one for myself as well and it has continued to perform as well as it did on the first day I started it up. It is also a great tablet for someone who is a first time user of this type of technology. I would purchase another one should the need arise without giving it a second thought.
1,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack
1,Fire is all that I was hoping for and much more...
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.
1,"Very good item for a very reasonable price. Easy to work, gets the job done."
1,I got a second one for my downstairs TV. Works great
0,Took awhile to get it all setup. After getting it all setup it was fun to play with for awhile than it was just okay. Have to get the wording just right to listen to radio stations or it tells you can't find it or plays something totally different.
1,This is way better than the amazon fire stick. I would recommend in any day over it
1,It's a great tablet. Does everything you need from a table and for only $50
1,So much difference on viewing all the apps on 4k up scaling was excellent. Unbelievible.
1,If you never thought about getting a Echo you should now because this is the best thing since sliced bread.
1,I bought this for my son for his room since he didn't want to spend the extra money for a cable box...he really likes this and is getting a lot of use out of it.
1,"I like Kindle obviously but I find the 10 inch is bulky, heavier and difficult to handle by someone with carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis. It's easier to see the screen on the 10"" but I prefer the smaller screen because it's better for handling with my arthritic, weak joints/grip. I do have to admit the bigger screen is better for watching videos and movies!"
1,It does what is says it does on the box. In this day and age that is something to take note of.
1,Alexa has been a great addition to our home. She does many things that we have not began to explore. We just got this for Christmas and look forward to advancing our home with Alexa.
1,Awesome product. Everything works great and easy to use
1,"If is better for the price , I bought fur the kids."
1,I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.
1,This item works well. Will help you avoid those monthly cable fees
1,Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet
1,"I'm deepy invested in the Apple ecosystem so I approached using the Echo as a just something to experiment with. Now I understand Barry Diller's statement that eventually Jeff Bezos will be the richest man in the world. And for me it starts with the Echo. I use it from the (funny) morning alarm to bedtime when it manages my night time Hue light scenes. I prefer to listen to music through the Echo and not tie up my other devices. I've ordered several Dots and am looking forward to being able to use a more serious speaker for music. Now that I've been sucked into the Amazon universe I've abandoned my Apple TV and replaced it with the Fire TV becuase of the Alexa voice control. The kids use Alexa for homework and even my ""beyond cool"" teenage son admits it's a worthwhile technology. I have a lot of fun with the IFTTT recipes; its become a bit of a hobby. And rather than having a technology where you blink your eyes and it's out of date, the best thing so far about the Echo is it just keeps getting better with more product integrations, ""skills"", and ever expanding content. I recommend getting one soon so you can enjoy the new stuff as it comes along."
1,Needed a set of cheap speakers for a secondary computer. Couldn't get much cheaper and to my surprise they were easy to install and the sound quality is wonderful.
1,"I bought this for my mom who didn't have a tablet at the time and she had no idea what to do with it, but with very little help from me she figured it out through the tutorials provided. The screen isn't as large as I would've hoped but it does the job."
0,"Good for watching movies offline but not so good at internet. I also have problems with it deciding I don't have the SD card in and have to take it out and put it back in. Very frustrating!!! The first one I had didn't know the SD card was there after shutting it off. They were great about sending me a new one but now I have to call them back and tell them what is going on now. I prefer to use my old Android tablet. It also won't let me remove the password or I have to take off the free time. I have to call them and see what I can do about that. It is for her and not really for me anyway. Why do I have to have a password for everything? Not too impressed but a really good buy. The ads, when you turn it on, don't bother me at all and was worth saving the $20."
1,"Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all."
1,"Keeps my daughter busy, lots of app choices indeed"
1,Bought this for my son and he loves it. Only thing I wish battery ran longer other than that great tablet.
1,"This little android tablet does everything I want it to. And for the price, it can't be beat. 50$!"
0,"I had an old ipad and when it quit I decided to go for the amazon fire tablet--really only used it to play games and for entertainment....i hate it---battery life is very short I pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all times, and it freezes and just shuts out of screens. I can't take it anymore and am now going to buy another ipad---don't waste your money on this!! I am very unimpressed with this product and amazon in general now."
1,Never had an Ereader before but I love this. Really helpful for reading assignments in graduate school.
1,Excellent purchase and easy to set up. Great entertainment console.
1,"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
1,"Didn't really need this with how many options are currently on the market, however my wife received an Amazon Echo for Christmas, decided to give this to her to augment Alexa, My wife is happy, therefore I'm happy:). Works with Alexa btw:)"
0,It runs pretty slow. I wish it ran a faster then it would be great
1,"Aiden's is loving his tablet, using educational apps learning his letters and numbers"
1,I purchased one for each of my kids (4) and they love them and now I don't have to fight for my phone because they are on it playing app games lol!!!
1,Great Product - works great It has great range. My kids keep asking it questions and thy really seem to enjoy it.
1,I love my Alexa. Great product and capabilities. Can re-order items from Amazon!
1,My kids use this tablet. It works great! I think I got more than what I paid for. Can't expect more for approx $30.
1,"fast and responsive, love the interface, lots of content to watch"
1,I purchased the reader for my wife to replace her old reader. The old reader was the 1st edition. The paperwhite is amazing. It is much lighter and the page is much clearer. My wife is an avid reader and really loves her Kindle.
1,"Love it. never an issue, just like a computer but so much smaller and convenient."
1,This tablet was a gift for a child and they absolutely love it.
1,The Kindle Paperwhite reader is great for reading in the dark. Its very light and easy to maneuver the pages. I haven't tried reading it outdoors yet but when summer time comes I'll be using it alot.
1,"I bought this as a starter tablet for my 8 year old daughter. We first bought one just for kids, but the parental controls didn't work right. So I just set up a password on the Kindle for anytime it's in use. With moderate supervision, it worked out great. She uses it mainly for reading, watching Netflix, and playing games."
1,Good for everyday use. Grandsons wish there could be more free access
1,Its a great item if your looking to cut down on cable tv evrything you are looking for
1,"I wanted a cheap tablet to watch movies on. It streams all apps well ( Netflix, YouTube, and others). The only complaint is the internet browser is garbage. I also have a fire tv and 2 fire sticks. Amazon products work well."
1,My grandkids like to use my tablet when they come to visit. I bought them each one for at home.
1,"Great product that is easy to install and setup. It does not come with an HDMI cable so be sure to have one handy. On a side note, your email with get spam continuously with Amazon Advertisement to be sure to unsubscribe as soon as you can."
1,My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well
0,"I got this to use while I travel because you can connect to Wi-Fi that has a webpage for signing in, like pretty much all hotels require. It was awesome for about two weeks. At first it worked fine with my brand new awesome Samsung 4k tv, then a week later the tv didn't even recognize it. Apparently it doesn't pay nice with Samsung. Not a huge deal since I bought it for traveling, then it didn't display correctly on the hotel tv, it was just a tiny piece of the picture and it was jammed into the top corner and the rest black. The next hotel, it looked fine but there wasn't any audio. COME ON. Really stinks."
1,My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.
1,"Bought two of these for my nieces, they are truly enjoying them. just what they asked for."
1,I love my amazon fire HD tv box. This thing is the wave of the future. The 4k content looks amazing.
1,I have one of the very early versions of the Kindle and the Kindle Paper-White is so much more compact. That makes it really great for travel. I also love the self-recharging capability.
1,I like the fire tv because I can hook my lan cable to it
1,We needed to upgrade to 4K and this made it available.
1,My wife has had several Amazon Fire tablets. They all have one major flaw. Visibility in direct sunlight. This product addresses that issue. The Paper White screen is perfect for the days at the pool
1,Easy set up and usage! Great fun for all in the house! Got one for myself and one as a gift. Great for any age. Highly recommend
1,"The Amazon Echo is great. Good speakers, works as advertised."
1,"I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet"
1,"We bought this for our teenage grandson, who uses it for games, internet, and friend chat. Works great, and the price didn't break the bank."
0,"This product is well made, durable and reliable. I have had good experiences with this manufacturer. I recommend this manufacturer and this particular product. This product does exactly what I need it to do. Super easy to use. I have used other manufacturers in the past but have not always been satisfied. I am happy with this product."
1,The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
0,This movie could have been a little more action packed. Ok for what it was
1,"and you can't beat the price. Normally $50, these were on sale for $30 for Black Friday so I picked up 2 as gifts."
0,"The best reader out there - however don't expect to use this tablet for its web browser function - looks strange seeing ""paper"" versions of websites as the paper white feature cannot be turned off."
1,This product is as described. It's portable and the speaker is loud.
1,Bought a second Kindle so my wife would stop using mine. Outstanding product.. Easy to download books and the book prices are reasonable.
1,Good startup tablet for reading articles online & shop
1,This device is faster than the firestick by far. Remote is responsive and when you click something it opens right away. Love the fact that it has ethernet which is a game changer when streaming.
1,This tablet is the perfect size for kids. It's great for adults too if your looking for something not so big.
1,A perfect gift for entry level person. Very light weight and handy to use
1,Great way to listen to your music through all of your accounts and play lists. The voice commands make it real simple. I
0,"From the minute you turn it on there's advertising. The OS is very different from a standard tablet OS - I couldn't get an app that I wanted from the Google Play Store - it just wouldn't work on this. As I said before, I found the amount of advertising just ridiculous."
1,My Grandson uses it all the time. It was a great choice!
1,"It was purchased primarily for my nephew, to assist him in his upcoming schooling"
1,Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
1,"The best tablet I have had! Overall its great.Great camera, tools, apps & great battery! That will last."
0,brought it as a gift for my uncle and its a decent tab for the price.
1,The best thing ever. Getting rid of cable was due to this.
1,"Love this device. No glare, lightweight, and portable. Make sure to get a case, the outside bezel tends to scratch rather easily."
1,For the price & quality this produce is great for gifts or for the person that likes to read on the go.
1,Had to buy two for each kid of mine. They absolutely love it.
1,who would not love this product when it is so simple to use and you will get hours of enjoyment from it.
1,LOOOOVVVVVEEEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"This unit can tell you past, present and some future things and in an instant too!"
1,Love all the shows with no commercials. Soon i will save more money by canceling cable TV.
0,First got it for my wife who loves tech toys. We played with it and laughed and laughed. But after awhile it's used less and less as it can't find answers to things.
1,"Love how it is easy , kid friendly, and my son loved it."
1,great ultracheap tablet from brand you can trust! buy two!
1,Son reports it work FANTASTICLY at UC IRVINE.Displays PDFs quite well.Fewer non- school distractions than other tablets.
1,I love this tablet and it is very nice and reliable and would highly recommend
1,It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
1,Purchased as a chrismas gift. receipent was very happy with the present.
1,"Great price. My kids (5 years old) love it, they can download games and browse the web without a problem."
0,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
1,I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library.
1,"I love Alexa. I've purchased the light/other electronics control wall plug ins and now not only can Alexa keep me company, play my music, and basically be my personal assistant but she can turn on/off my lights and electronics when I ask. Next is to purchase the thermostat. I'm sure there is more to come."
1,Fun talking to Alexa and getting quick replies for so many questions.
1,My 15 year old is curious about adult material. But with this tablet you can control so much of the content he sees. You can even control how much he learns before watching videos and games.
1,Lighter than a helium balloon. So thin. Bright white screen. Crisp letters. Intuitive. Easy touchscreen page turning (or a gentle squeeze on either side of the book) and easy menu access. Ideal size. I don't know how they can improve this further. Just ordered their (Kindle's) Origami cover too.
1,"I bought this for my kids aged 7 and 3. It's strong, bright, light weight, affordable and easy to use. I have never used any of the Amazon Fire products so there was a learning curve but and hour later I feel like a Fire pro."
1,I bought this for my grandson and he likes it a lot He is only 5 years old and it is perfect size for him He wanted a red one but likes the blue.We put abc mouse on it and he is able to find it for himself. Great price
1,"We bought the echo for ourselves and enjoyed the features so much we bought several as Christmas presents. The music library is tremendous, love having the shopping list as it synchs with the app. Still some learning to be done by Alexa and our preferences, but overall, very happy with this purchase."
1,"We bought this tablet for my son to do his homeschool classes on, and he loves it!"
1,"I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
1,I needed to replace my old kindle and this one is perfect even has a camera!
1,why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!
1,"After going over all of the info on most all of the tablets on the market, I was having trouble deciding which one to get. But on Black Friday, for $35.00, for my first tablet, I was sold!"
1,Can you download drama fever application in this? Please share your answer..thank you
0,"It's a fun little toy but lacks practicality. In order to make it user friendly, I recommend a battery for it. You will also need Amazon prime in order for the music to play worth a darn. Otherwise you will be stuck searching through your phone for your song."
1,Very pleased with this product. I am now thinking about cutting the cable company out!
1,"Alexa is the best, she tells me the news, play my songs and ste the temperature of my home. I'm definitely enjoying the Amazon Echo."
0,"Bought for very young grandkids. You get what you pay for. A little slow. Good for watching things like Netflix and playing games and JWBroadcasting. Navigation okay. Not great. Kids are usually hard on anything, so if it gets broken, ok. But no problems so far and the kids like it. Would never buy for myself, or anyone over 10."
1,i really like my fire it has a nice picture and is easy to operate
1,Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.
1,Easy to set up and navigate. Got two for my parents
1,I purchased this for my husband who has been so busy that reading for pleasure just wasn't happening as much as he liked. If he'd take his tablets to read for pleasure he would get distracted doing work rather than reading for pleasure. He now makes the time to have some time off and is enjoying novels again. Good pricing. Now we are considering getting Kindles for each of our Grandchildren too.
1,Fire is still a good tablet and a great tablet for the price.
1,this was bought for my wife she loves it . She can get anything answered. what and how to cook things and how to fix things
1,I bought this for my young grand daughter to start teaching her basic colors and numbers. She uses it like a pro and we have a great variety of teaching games. Her parents just bought one for their house. Have been using for a year and still working like new.
1,It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
1,Amazing resolution is a great diference with the firestick
1,"Having realistic expectations is a must with the Echo. I had thought the AI would be much better than it is. Sometimes you need to say something three times for Alexa to find it. For example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two times she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she finds it. This is with voice training complete mind you. I purchased three echos to use as a starter system to play music on each floor of my house. They did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echos. Be warned though if you ask Alexa to play your group (multiple echos) you cannot play all your devises at once using Spotify for example. Verbally asking Alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music. The Alexa app needs some work but is fairly easy to navigate. I feel Im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone. You need to enable skills in order to get responses to certain questions which to me is a big draw back. I think most have the intention of buying the Echo, setting it up, and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup. Remembering specific phrases to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle. I gave it four stars because it works for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank. I think there is still a lot of improvements that could be made and it seems Amazons priority isnt necessarily the Echo. From reviews Ive read the request to play music on multiple devices was something people were asking for since the products release. I was able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if I would have paid full price I would have returned all three and saved my money. Wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfalls of the product."
1,"Helpful device, easy to install and setup, great speakers"
1,This product is easy to use for people that aren't to good with very high tech stuff. My mother likes it.
1,I love my amazon fire tablet. It's great to watch movies on and surf the web.
1,Easy to set up. Getting all my music through Amazon.
1,My son loves it !Never had this when I was his age
1,It's as near as the public can enjoy towards artificial intelligence.
1,Straight out of the box It was so easy plug and play. Voice prompt worked great
1,Great price on Black Friday. Bought for my grandson. Interface is a little different but a good purchase
1,"Great for streaming Amazon Prime amongst others. This is a must have, especially if a 4K tv is owned. Love it. Quick navigation speed, due to the memory and processor this box exhibits."
1,Works great sounds good. Only criticism is there is no volume control like the dots for manual adjustments
1,My daughter love it and is amazing thanks and I will recommend it
0,"Good Average device for internet content but for 4K forget about it, but if your looking for a simple HD content is good enough."
1,This is honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made
1,"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
1,I love all of my Amazon products and this one is no different. Great quality and clear pictures
1,"And never talks back. This is the best product out there to demonstrate just what technology can do for the average person, and it is constantly updated.every home should have one!"
1,And now I say cheap but not in the pejorative sense. Good price and with great functionality. Many uses. Reading. Surfing the web. Games. Love it all.
1,It works fine and is easy to use. I would recommend it.
1,I really love the fire TV. I use it all of the time. If I'm not using it my kids are using it. Great for all ages!
1,"Ok, so I will not say its perfect but it is really close, I bought it for my wife to have endless music... Yes its great.... But then I connected it to my home automation and I will say it really nice not to have to get up to turn on or off light in a room again...Constant updates keep me interested."
1,"This is the best affordable streaming player. Easy to use, and the voice remote just adds to the experience."
1,"This product is great, and I really like it. Especially for kids."
1,My daughters love this tablet and all they can do.
1,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.
1,"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,"Canceled my cable and got one of these. Steams netflix, hulu, amazon prime and anything else you need great."
1,It was a hit during our Christmas white elephant party! (:
1,Great tablet! New to me so I have a lot to learn about it's functions.
1,"I purchased this and the Dot for use with my elderly parents. Both have poor eyesight and this voice driven product has enriched their lives. Set up an Amazon Alexa product for them and enrich their lives. Alarm clocks, timers, weather, news, music are just some of the things that can help them."
1,Way better than fire stick. I needed more words and had nothing more to say.
1,The price is perfect and the portability can't be beat!
1,"Very useful! Love it! Love being able to say Alexa play this specific song, and boom there it is"
1,All I can say is wow. This is a really nice box. I would recommend it.
0,Except unlike the Millennium Falcon this doesn't have it where it counts. Software is a mess. I didn't expect much from a $50 tablet but man was it painful to use.
1,"I bought this tablet for my 5-year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. It's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games."
1,This is s good inexpensive tablet that works well for young folks.
1,The best add on to your tv ever!! Shopping streaming all together
1,It is great my husband and I enjoy it every day!!!!!
1,I purchased this product based on the reviews of no glare and its ease of use. Both are true.
1,I like using them so much that I bought one for everyone in the family and I have three at home.
0,When purchased it wouldnt turn on. After doing some research everyone said theirs did that after dropped or being dropped in water. I FINALLY got it to come on.
1,This is a great tablet for kids and is very easy to set up.
0,The free Geek Squad virus protection does not work and the apps you can download are limited.
1,"PROS: - A MUST for Amazon Prime subscribers - lots of media content - For PlayStation Vue subscribers, it's speedy and fast; works great- Noticeably faster than 1st generation Amazon Fire Stick- High-quality feel of the remote control- Smartphone App works great- Alexa-enabled CONS:- Vudu app is not supported by Amazon- Not compatible with generic universal remotes (unless you buy Logitech Harmony Remotes) TIP:- Prices can easily fluctuate from $79-$99"
1,"Good product, but if you have the old paperwhite, no need for upgrade in my opinion cause I noticed very little difference."
1,This tablet is very well made and well worth the price. Amazon has a great market place and the tablet has a nice clear picture and the touch screen functions very well. Got it for my 3 year old son and he loves it plus I like that it has parental controls so I can block out things I don't want him accessing...
1,"I love my fire. Easy to carry where ever I go,just great"
1,The amazon fire tv is amazing. Small portable yet powerful and good quality. It is also structured well so things are easy to find.
1,"No need to purchase a smart tv with this device. Wish it came with an hdmi but I pulled one off the unused x box system. I also purchased some velcro from a craft store to mount it to the back of the tv. It is very light, so no need to buy any kind in mounting kit for it."
1,"Bought on sale for $40. Good portable 7"" tablet for email, web browsing, etc. while traveling."
1,I added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house. I don't like that you have to tap it to activate
1,"This is my first ereader. I've wanted one for awhile but wasn't impressed with features until the two most recent versions of Paperwhite were released (I have the latest version). I've read a few books and several magazines on it, so at this point I'm familiar with it. Basic functionality is excellent. For reading text it's pretty straightforward; magazine articles with images worked well for me, but I can see where screen formatting could be an issue for more complex illustrations. The backlight is very good (I wouldn't buy an ereader without it). Pages flips are lightening fast, and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure (I have a few complaints, see below). Nice integration with the Amazon leather cover, you can just close the book and it shuts down. Buying books from Amazon is simple, and they are delivered via my home WiFi in seconds. Battery life seems endless, and recharge is simple (the included cable charges via a PC, wall charger is an accessory you must purchase). Great device for older readers, as you can kick up the font size and lighting for squint-free reading. It's about the size of a small paperback book and as light as a feather.My complaints: 1) Ads are mildly annoying, it's aggravating to pay more for an ad-free version; 2) Availability of books from my local library remain shockingly limited, even though these devices are hardly new; 3) The Amazon library for book loans (available for a monthly fee) is also very limited. I had a 30-day trial period, during which time I searched for several classic novels on both Amazon and my local library -- big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list. Want to read Catch-22 or Atlas Shrugged? You've got to buy it. ; 4) Highlighting is clumsy using a finger, although I've improved over time. Changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tabs is useless; 5) If you like to flip through a book, the Paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book. If you've read 50 pages, but went forward to see something on pages 180-190, you'll return to 191 next time. If you flip around a lot you'll get a real mess. Manual bookmarks are the only solution. 6) It's my understanding that when you buy a book from Amazon, you are getting a license to read that book on an Amazon device only (you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device). So if you buy a different brand of ereader 5 years from now you'll have to rebuy your library.Despite all this, I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it if you'd like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet."
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because it gives you the ability to use streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and many other android based programs. The Amazon OS and GUI is excellent. Smooth and not complicated. The ability to use the microphone on the remote is perfect for anyone as it is very accurate and easy to use. The video streaming is very good, the processors and RAM can give you smooth playback with any media file you can play on it. I highly recommend this box for anyone looking for a streaming device at a great price."
0,"Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok"
1,"I have waited to purchase a Tablet - when the Kindle Fire came on sale I decided to take advantage of the sale price. So far this has been a very good purchase for what I intend to use the Tablet for. E-mail, Facebook, News and BOOKS to read. Easy to use and have enjoyed this product."
1,"I bought the Fire TV because, as much as I liked my Fire Stick, I found it was not great at buffering and I found that often the image on the screen would freeze. The Fire TV doesn't have that issue, and the controls and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth. Also the voice control works wonderfully."
1,I use echo everyday to check on weather and listen to music
1,This is the 4th Kindle fire we have purchased - we love this tablet - its a great price and a great product!
1,It is a good product to use for child aged 7-15 years.
1,This is the second Fire tablet for $35 that I purchased this season. They are a great value and Best Buy has been a great place to buy them
1,Bought as a gift for a disabled relative. She loves it.
1,Cant beat $50 for a brand name. Both for reading and browsing.
0,Gave tablet as a Christmas gift - she uses it all of the time and loves it. She was thrilled to get it I bought the extended warranty so that the tablet would be covererd in case something happened to it. Her mother had seen it advertised and I bought it on thanksgiving day
0,Decent product that has great value. Definitely buy again for a gift
1,Easiest device to read a book on. Easy to read in any light and easy to hold.
1,Nice inexpensive tablet that is easy to use. Bought it for my 5 year old son and he loves it!
1,Excellent I love it!!!! It is the best assistant!!1
1,"Everyone needs to stop reading reviews and go out and buy the Echo! I used to ask myself the most random things; what is half of 3/4, do aliens exist, and how tall is Khloe Kardashian. Well, no more awkward silences to my own questions. Alexa has been a massive help in answering my questions. Alexa has made my life so much easier and I don't even have to push any buttons. Alexa is a computer and not a human, so you have to ask Alexa questions as if you were typing it in Google BUT you have to say Alexa, followed by your question. Definitely some kinks to work out but as a GEN1 product, the Amazon Echo is awesome! Literally, stop reading this review and just purchase it!"
1,"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job."
1,I like the e-reader on here plus I have all the apps as well
1,I bought this as a gift for my mother. It is very easy to set up and use. She doesn't need a lot of space or use many apps so this is great for her to use without having to go to her laptop.
1,"I was skeptical about this at first. Once I learned how useful the scores to further expand the capabilities of my Amazon prime membership, I was quite impressed. Her responses are very prompt and accurate. I look forward to adding on bills and whistles using Alexa turn on and off lights in the house or setting the temperature by speaking a command."
1,Purchased for step father who wasn't into technology (still has a flip phone). He was able to get the tablet up and running and was surfing online with no problems. Great tablet for beginners.
1,"After much consideration, we purchased Alexa. Amazing sound and love the new features that are added regulating."
1,The Kindle Fire is great for trips. The airplane mode is easy to find and it's nice having access to amazon prime video.
1,Bought it for my 94 year old Mother who is losing her vision. It has opened up a whole new world for her!
1,It works like it's supposed to. Use it for charging my new Kindle.
1,We are enjoying our new Echo and what Alexa can and cannot recognize.
1,Perfect for my grandson I love the easy to use set up and parental control. I have recommended this to my friend for her children. Case is great
1,"This has been a very nice addition, it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it."
1,"Works great even downstairs from my nighthawk router, responds much quicker than fire stick and works great with ps Vue. For sure get this over the stick."
1,Large display makes it easy to use. Very easy to use.
1,"I got this after discontinuing with direct tv. fast internet and playstation vue is half the price and ill i need. box is like an all in one entertainment, easier to watch netflix and hulu on here as well"
1,"It's not as user friendly as advertised, but I guess it works ok"
1,"Easy to use, providing many options and ability for add-ons, really great!"
1,Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
1,"This is a great tablet for gaming, movies and of course reading. The child's version is awesome also."
1,best money I ever spent for my grand child she just love it
1,"Great tablet to have for the kids and me to play games, read books, etc. I just wish it was able to get more of the apps that are on android"
1,"Before you spend a lot if money on a high end tablet for your kids, try this one. Great value!"
1,The pleasure of using this product in both my office and living areas can only be described as pleasant and convenient because of the ease of operation and the luxury of having voice activated commands to help you during a busy day.
1,I gave this as a Christmas present and they are using it every day!
1,My kids used the fire on a resent trip abroad . It works great for sending e-mails using the wifi and playing games.
1,Amazon kindle works great! Already reading lots of books
1,Fire TV works great for movies and tv shows. Download the KODI APP and open up 100s of movies and shows.
1,"Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot."
1,I bought this as a gift for my stepdaughter. She seems to be happy with it
1,i love this tablet. but my only complaint is the battery life. it sucks.
0,Not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up. Not a big fan of the online tutorial. Had a really hard time in powering it off. Camera setting did not take very good pictures. DID NOT LIKE THE MULTIPLE ADS ON IT EVERY TIME I USED IT. FINALLY IT LOCKED UP ON ME AND I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO GO TO SETTINGS SO I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH IT. Probably will be returning this product to Best Buy.
1,"Love the echo!!! We use it for weather, pandora, an alarm amongst other things. We plan to purchase others!"
1,Gotta love technology. What a cool device. I use it for playing music
1,We really enjoy the Echo. I really would only recommend it to someone that has a prime membership.
1,Very useful and easy to navigate! Def recommend to anyone who loves to stream!
1,"Im very happy with this purchase, i got it on sale for $30 and grabbed 3 lol.Kids luv it"
1,"I love my Amazon Fire TV box. I am using it with Playstation Vue, Hulu, CBS All Access, and a few of the movie channels. With these services and an antenna, I have both live TV and shows that I watch on demand. While it takes more effort to set up than cable, it is significantly less expensive."
1,"Enjoying this product. Easy to set up and the speakers are great. So nice to have a device that respond so well. Love the music, news, weather updates, and jokes."
0,Spectrum works with Roku and smart cast app so we had to return and get a roku. Don't buy if you want to stream Spectrum to TVs without a cable box.
1,Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.
1,No surprise here!! Works quite well!!
1,Muy recomendable.
1,Great sound and syncs well with andriod phones. Good buy
1,"My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
1,We bought the Amazon Fire TV device to watch streaming TV and it works great! Love the guide feature!
1,Wouldn't be able to live without this box! It has never let me down.
1,Bought this as a Fathers Day gift for myself using the gift cards my family gave me and love it.
0,This is great for a connected home. People who use this should buy it if they plan on making everything in their home wi-if enabled. Otherwise it's an expensive SIRI.
1,Fire Box works great. Much better than Firestick because it can be hard wired directly to modem and also had more memory than stick.
1,Really makes it easy to listen to any music I want without having to pick up my phon
1,"Got good deal on it from BestBuy, 50% off. I would not buy it at full price unless you buy a lot from Amazon and implementing automation at your house. Some skills are very useful, like Dish integration and Smart Plugs etc."
1,I had wanted a kindle for a very long time. When I saw the price I could not resist
1,Have a firestick and now a fire box and I am impressed with both products. The box however is a much more superior product. The speed is extremely noticeable and the expandable memory slots are a bonus. The ability to hardwire directly into my router makes for buffer free streaming. Well worth the extra money.
1,Quad core processing and the extra RAM makes this device really fast and the GUI makes it easy to use.
1,"Good tablet for my grand kid had to replace defective one, but otherwise great gorgeous his use"
1,"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
1,What can one say. It charges my Kindle.
1,This is perfect for my 4 year old. It needs an Sd card because the memory is low but it keeps him happy.
1,It was brought for my 67 yr old dad.....and he loves it.....
1,"I like the fire, wish it was vudu and flixst enabled but good"
1,Perfect gift for Christmas! After receiving it I ordered another one.
1,I bought this Black Friday for an exceptional deal and my son loves it!
1,This is a fantastic tablet. I take it to workAll the time.
1,Decent product given the low price point. Got it for gifting and the kid enjoys it.
1,"Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults."
1,"Works well, gives a to of additional options for home television entertainment for everyone."
1,Love it and now that I can play music throughout the house on all my echo and dots simultaneously it's even better.
1,I have had a blast since I purchased this Amazon Fire tv. I had issues with the remote but after calling they immediately sent me a replacement. Great service and I am considering reducing my cable now since I can do so much cheaper through this item now.
1,I absolutely love my Amazon Echo! I have several around the house and in my office.
1,"its great, i hooked my amazon prime up to it, that is the best"
1,Great gift for the whole family. I like the music most of all. Tells jokes and answers all your questions. Bought one for a gift and one for myself.
1,Really super nice way to watch TV...I am a Amazon Prime member so I don't know how great it would be without Prime but with it it's the best way to watch TV...PERIOD!
1,"faster then the firestick tv version but not as portable, still a great product for streaming"
1,This was a christmas present for my mom. She likes to read. Its a good tablet for a ridiculous price.
0,"The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage."
1,My son loves this tablet. No complaints. You can't beat the quality at this price
0,Product works ok. It's user friendly. I don't really need or use it much after purchasing it. For those that like it ..what a bargain
1,This is a nice tablet. It has a really good clear screen.
1,I have to say this tablet is perfect for my young kids and durable!
1,I love this thing so much it plays pandora non stop and answers all my questions.
1,"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."
1,Great product and superior technology. We use it every day.
1,This is how to watch TV via streaming using the FIRE TV that's also 4K compatible! LOVE IT-
1,Small but easy to use. Good selection of kid friendly apps.
1,Bought this tablet for my wife she really enjoys it
1,"Some apps, like youtube, will have trouble when on wifi network. All other games work perfectly fine. Perfectly aimed at teenagers and younger."
1,Was a gift for my mom and she loves it. Thanks Amazon
1,"I bought 2 of these because they were on sale for $33.33. I really like them, but the Kaspersky internet security that I received free for 6 months will not download onto the tablets. I am going to have to call the Geek Squad to fix this problem."
1,"So we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now. Buying one piece at a time and implementing them makes the cost less scary! We have a Wink hub, Cree LED lights, MyQ garage door opener, AT&Ts Digital Life security and automation, Nest thermostat, etc. It has been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit us in real life rather than in cheesy video clips on YouTube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone. You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do. Now, we just say, ""Alexa, bedroom light 10%"" or ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off"" or ""Alexa, play Bloodhound Gang on Spotify"", etc. The Echo makes utilizing your home automation much easier, plus with the ever growing list of 'skills' I can start my car, play a game, listen to music, get my news, control media playback, order a pizza, buy stuff from Amazon, even schedule an Uber pickup, etc. If your specific car or app or whatever isn't available yet, just give it some time and it'll most likely end up supported! Very, very cool technology!"
1,"My wife wanted this for her birthday. She loves it! Speakers could be better, but a great device for fun and information!"
1,My wife and I are so happy with the range of functions on this product that we bought one as a gift for her sister. Love the clear and crisp screen and ability to navigate easily.
1,"Bought this as a gift for my friends daughter, Works really well, good tablet for about 40 dollars. I did opt for the 2 year protection, Just in case something happens in the 2 years."
1,"I used Google Chromecast before but by far, this is the best, even better than Apple tv. I have also Amazon echo so this even makes it better for me."
0,"I purchased this item on the recommendation of many existing owners. However, when I got home and attempted to set up the device, it was frustrating and the instructions/FAQs were not very helpful. The echo could not find my NEST thermostat, nor could it find about half of my HUE lights. Once I argued and fought with Alexa for about 45 minutes, she finally started to pick up my lights and after COMLETELY re-configuring my thermostat, she could see it, but she would not work with it. Once she found all of my lights, she would turn them on or off, but would not change colors or brightness levels. I run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life. This should not have been this quirky. I would not recommend this item. Get a Google Home."
1,The new Fire TV has every streaming option that you can think of except VUDU. This is the only negative that we have found because we have over 100 digital copies of movies that have been either purchased or came with the blue-ray when we bought them. It is very convenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie. The Fire TV loses that convenience in that Amazon wants you to use their Prime service for digital movies. If you are going to subscribe to Amazon Prime then look no further than the Fire TV. If you have a large digital movie collection then I'd look to the Roku 4.
1,Great tech works well highly recommended no issues
1,"its ok, u have to buy all the subscriptions and sometimes half of them just buffer the whole time, I have very fast internet and its wired so idk whats up with it."
1,My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
1,I love it. Great product that I would recommend to all.
1,Very nice to hear most of my favorite music. Only reason i did not give 5 stars is i could not retrieve a popular radio station in another city i wanted to listen to.
1,"The tablet is fast, clear, and easy to use. Highly recommended!"
1,"I utilize my Echo every morning as I get ready for work. Alexa helps me decide what to wear with weather updates, which is the best route to take to work and all the while playing my fav tunes."
0,"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
1,"... and anywhere else! I love it. For the first time since I've had a Kindle, I can finally read it outside. Great for reading NYT on Sunday mornings by the pool!"

1,understands all the different accents and you have all the info ready and available alway
1,"Solid tablet with good performance, WiFi connectivity and app availability. It doesn't have all the breadth of apps that iOS or Android has, but the choices are reasonable. Most importantly (for me), this Fire HD tablet is a very good web browser, eReader and video streaming device. So, I would rate it highly for these functions alone"
1,"The Kindle Fire 7"" replaced my old and broken Kindle Reader and has exceeded all my expectations and requirements. I plan to buy a 10"" in the near future and pass the 7"" to my wife to replace her Kindle Reader"
0,"Love it, but at times it just goes black. I have to unplug and hook back up order for it to work, sometimes multiple times. Same with the reg fire stick that i have on anther TV."
1,Great item works perfect and great protection. Exactly what I needed.
1,"This is a good item, i purchased several of these including family members, friends, and ideal for gift. I do recommend these devices, the special offers are not annoying."

1,Good My wife likes it better that the more expensive ones and other brands
1,"love this firetv. i have an amazon account, but i installed and subscribe to PlaystationVue to get channels i used to pay comcast for - WAY cheaper. easy product to setup and use- definitely worth the $$ to be able to dump cable tv!!"
1,I use it for games and movies...its great..good picture quality....great sound...could use more storage space..but i guess thats why they make sd cards...
0,From the beginning we've had issues with our remote
1,I bought three of these tablets. They are the best tablets around. They are very fast and durable as well. They are simple to use both of my children use them. I haven't had any issues with this product.
1,and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot.

1,Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly!
1,Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children

1,Great starter to running the whole house with wifi. Client loved the gift!
1,We don't have one complaint. We are very satisfied.
1,This download movies fast and quick. You get a good picture when using the fire tv because you have to use your hdmi wire
1,"I purchased this for my 8 year old son, and he loves it. He can read his favorite books and play his games. Great for both education and games!"
1,Very satisfied with the small tablet. Larger than my phone so I can see things better when I play games and look up thing on the internet.
1,"This is great. So many things come with a plug that is to go into your laptop. I got this so I can plug it into the wall. I had Kindle chargers for my kindle, but I'm getting more and more things that have to be charged through your laptop. Not me...I use this plug."
1,I ended up having to get this or a Roku to use my playstation vue since my Samsung smart tv doesn't allow it. This works great!

1,"This is a great tablet for my elderly mom. Compact, but easily readable."

1,Good product with excellent options from the Amazon app store.
1,I was really surprised how easy it was to use and set up. I may be looking to add one in my man cave and bedroom too! Great device
1,The fire stick is the holy grail of entertainment. Easy to set up and easy to use. The apps are user friendly and easy to navigate.
1,I've had the Amazon Fire TV for a few weeks now an absolutely love it. My wife and I have cut the cords with cable tv and now stream everything through Fire TV. The quad core processor can keep up with the most demanding HD streams and 3D movies without buffering. If needed Fire TV can be hardwired to you router for additional speed. The apps are endless and you can run all of the popular options out there including Hulu and Sling. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to escape cable.
1,"Set up without a hitch. Downloaded MLB app and that works perfectly, and is the main reason I got this. Netflix also very usable on this device."
1,This is a perfect tablet for my 9 year old daughter we weren't looking to spend a whole lot of money since she has broke two already. The only thing I wish you could change is the home screen you can't customize it like most tablets but other than that great speed the camera is ok and the battery life is great.
1,This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
1,"This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc"
1,Glad that I get to control the time spent on which sure site and apps.

1,"Best price per performance reader amongst the Kindles, as of 06/2017."
1,overall a good product for the price. would recommend
1,Fun gift for adult children and their families. Bought three total for Christmas gifts
1,I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
1,"After a lot of research, decided to get the Fire for 80 year old mother-in-law. She is gradually learning it and is enjoying using it as a reader. Fairly quick learning curve for someone definitely not technologically inclined."
1,"Alexa Was my Mother's Day present and she now resides on our island in the kitchen. She is used for a timer for all the kids and they have even set multiple timers. Alexa is also set up to our living room lights and also our Nest Thermostat. Alexa can also tell you an unlimited amount of jokes, the kids start the day off with a joke."
0,I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
1,The Kindle's keep getting better and better. I purchased this for my son who is an avid reader. He loves it and I love that he is reading more.
1,This product was just as expected. Will order more.

1,Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............

1,"I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it."
1,Great starter tablet. Not all apps are available. Good for reading.
1,Bought the fire box for main Television in house and it works great
1,Purchased the Fire Box a couple of months ago and it's a great addition to the theatre room for watching movies. Easy to use and good download speed.
1,Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!
1,"Gave one of these to my sister for Christmas, who then RAVED about it. She said it was awesome. So I got one. I'm happy with it and I even got the remote, too.I especially like being able to tell it to add things to the shopping list/to-do list. In addition, I get a daily news briefing and get the best commute route for the morning."
1,"Now I can get Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime, and a lot more. There is more there than I can watch! Great value! Very easy to setup and flawless operation. I do have a very fast internet so I have no problems whatsoever."
1,I have multiple streaming devices in my home to include an appletv but I love that the fire stick is small and discreet
1,Very happy with this product and not having to pay outrages cable/satellite bills. Set up is a breeze.
1,I love Paper Books but my eyes do not like reading them. This E Reader is fantastic! I take it with me everywhere and Read in any light. Love Love Love this item!
1,I bought it for my nieces and nephews and they loved it.
1,MY DAUGHTER JUST LOVES THIS. EASY TO USE AND SHE IS ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING SHE WANTED ON IT. GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT
1,The resolution is great and price is also well. Best tablet I. It's price range.
1,"You're gonna need this because it doesn't come shipped with the Paperwhite. Great purchase, works perfectly!"
1,My son is a huge fan of it and I love that I can control what he watches and plays
1,This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!
1,ideal for reading books just like a hard cover book
1,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
1,"Use this device everyday. So much easier to carry than an iPad. Plus, Alexa is amazing."
1,We truly enjoy our Fire tv. It gives us a wide range of viewing from tv shows to movies
1,Great product works like a charm and has great speed even with bad internet service would recommend
1,I love this! I use it for my crochet patterns as well as my books!
1,So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
1,Got this as a Christmas gift for my father. So far (it's Feb now) he loves it and enjoys having Alexa tell him the news or the weather. Easy to set up and nice to be able to have music on demand without having to open any apps or turn anything on.
1,Very easy to use and to set up. All you need is a tv.
1,Bought this for my mom. Surprisingly very capable and fast. Quad processor for the price? Unbelievable. User friendly.
1,Side loaded with kodi and loving no cable bill. Well worth the money.
1,"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
1,Worked as expected and can use my old docking station
1,Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.
1,"I purchased this Kindle because I wanted the buttons on the side -- I prefer to hold my e-reader in just my left hand and it's hard to turn pages by screen press only. I love this so far! It's an upgrade from my Nook because it's so much easier to borrow books from the library! I've never used a Paperwhite so I can't speak as to how it's better, other than it has the side-press buttons (which was worth it to me)."
1,Awesome product. All voices in the house recognized. To do and shopping lists work great. Music playing is great
1,I wanted a tablet for easy internet access and an e-reader.This is easy to use and has exceeded my expectations.
1,"I am extremely pleased with my Kindle Voyage. It lives up to the hype. It is slightly smaller and lighter than the previous version. The ambient light monitor works well. Text is clear and very readable. My only negative comment would be that the battery does not seem to last as long as I expected. I have recently retired; so I am reading more. I recharge the reader about every week and a half. That said, I am reading indoors and perhaps the ambient backlighting is on more than normal."
1,This kindle is much faster than my old one. Great buy.
1,Easy to operate. Easy to download books. Size is great for carrying in a purse. Color is really good. Very happy with this product.
1,"Purchased as a Christmas Gift for my sister during Black Friday. Great tablet for reading books , surfing web, etc etc for your daily needs."
1,"Love my tablet, it is now my best of best friend!!!"
1,"Purchased this and the fire stick, this definitely showed a better picture quality and response compared to the stick. 4K imagine isn't bad at all and would consider this a good deal."
1,I have bought one for each of my kids and don't regret it for a second. Never seen them read more.
1,"We have dropped it a few times and the case is great. There is a ton of memory, great price. And how did I never know about Amazon underground. It's a great product and great price. I definitely recommend"
1,I run kodi and many other apps on It! Runs great for the price. I like the Nvidia Shield more but this is a third of the price!
1,It's not the fanciest tablet out there but it does everything I need it to do and does it well. It was on sale for 39 bucks! I already got my money's worth. Great buy
1,I bought the item for my goddaughter and she loves. Easy to use and durable. Reasonable price and great features
1,MY children love their new Amazon Fire Tablet. Quality picture and sound.
1,I would say Its a great Product Especially if You have high tech Gear all around your home to connect to Besides As a Speaker it has Pretty good Bass sounds Great!
1,"I bought this when it was on sale for a Christmas gift for a child in foster care. I think this is a great tablet for kids but wish there was more storage as you know with kids, they like to download stuff. It is a great first tablet for someone who is just getting started."
1,Excellent tablet for everyday use. It is not as responsive as the iPad Mini but can't beat the prices.
0,My daughter lovethis tablet.. only problem is it cant connect to my home wifi which is verizon
1,I have one and move it and I bought it for my 9 year old niece and she loves it! Works great!
1,"I received this as a birthday gift and I love it. The auto-brightness is amazing, the battery life is incredible, and the page turning feature is very useful. My only complaints are that it doesn't completely turn off, because it displays ads instead of showing a blank screen, and that the sorting and navigation could be more organized. Other than those two things, which are a minors to a whole, this product is wonderful."
1,Love hd qlty video awsome selection from music to tv shows
1,Good tablet for reading books and magazines. I like the tablet.
1,"I recently cut the cable and is using the Amazon TV to stream NetFlix, Pluto.tv and Plex. Works great. Response time is much better then the Amazon Stick. I have it hard wired to a gigabit port and Plex streaming works well."
1,"I love it. Can ask about weather, recipes, directions everything I use."
1,It's fun to have at a party when everyboby can ask it questions or ask for there favoite music.
1,Tablet is easy to use. Gives options for password as well as a protective case. 4 stars!
1,Perfect for my wife for her games; keeps them off her phone and much easier to work with ....
1,I love this product. It is exactly what I was hoping it would be.
1,Picked it up on the Black Friday sale it was a great deal
1,It is a good tablet to have. The books are good...
1,"Got rid of DirecTV and purchased an Amazon Fire TV. We stream video every night and the picture quality is incredible. Just make sure that your internet speed is able to keep up if you want to watch in HD. Nice to be able to cut the cord, save some money and not sacrifice picture and sound quality"
1,"Good run great ,no complain. You can try it and will see what happens ...."
1,Was purchased for a child. Works well and provides basic functions that were needed
1,It was a birthday present for a teenager. He carries it around and reads mostly on the kindle.
1,"I really love my Echo. I enjoy talking to Alexa every day and getting the news, trivia and podcasts. I love that it is a Bluetooth speaker and I can pair and play my phone or devices easily. The easy connection with other amazon devices allows you to easily call someone in your contacts. I want another one!"
1,"Really convenient, is amazing how many things you can do with Alexa. Also really responsive"
1,This tablet is mainly use for my children I highly recommend it
1,"Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver."
1,Upgraded from the fire stick and the picture is noticeably better. The quality and speed of streaming is much quicker.
1,"this sounds amazing , it is convenient to ask for a tune , and it does lots of other thing i do not know how to use it for yet , but in short , way cool"
1,Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
1,I cut the cord with cable and decided to try the Amazon Fire tv and it is amazing. Amazon Fire tv is the only box to offer basically all services. I did a lot of research and I am glad I went with this box!
1,I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
0,First day of purchase it overheats. Defective product.
1,This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user.
1,Excellent price point for feature rich product. The screen is clear & sound is passable. I would recommend this product as a great buy.
1,We purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. We spoke with one of the Best Buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. Made our decision easy. Thanks.
1,"Got this as a gift for my daughter. She's in College, and it's been very helpful for her to keep track of her schedule, emails, and appointments."
1,Great ereader! Easy on the eyes and the battery life last whole week. Enough said
1,"I really enjoy my echo. I listen to music, audible books, weather, the news. I talk to my mom with it because I bought her one also. This had a really amazing speaker. It's really great with answering science questions and anything you can find on Wikipedia. The only down side is, Amazon doesn't have a sever like Google does. So there are a lot of questions you may ask that the Echo can't answer. I really recommend this if you have Amazon Prime or the Nest thermometer or any of those smart gadgets that can be controlled with Echo. If you don't have these items or Prime, I would get the Google Home. You can listen to music and books using the different Google apps. With the echo you can order from Prime. You cannot link the Echo with other Echo devices yet to play music on all of them at the same time yet. I'm hoping that will change with time."
1,"The Amazon Echo provides great sound quality with no fuss. Just say ""Alexa play me some music"" and voila!!!Set up is easy."
1,"I purchased this specifically to take on a cruise. It exceeded my expectations. The voyager is slim, even with the cover, it is light weight and the screen is very clear. Battery life is good. I would absolutely recommend it."
1,Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy
1,The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
1,I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
1,I am satisfied with this purchase. It was cheap and good for my son.
1,I brought this for my nephew(6). He loves it does everything that the high dollar tablets do but at a fraction of the the cost. A very good buy!!!
1,I would purchase again. Great product for the price.
1,Entertainment or the quiet times you love. Perfect
1,"Best option out there for a plug and play device. The system is easy to use, set up, and is fast. I highly recommend the firetv over the fires tick, due to the power (much clearer feed and faster response). I previously had a roku which I gave away after getting this device."
1,I bought this for my daughter. She is 14 and loves it. It was simple to set up and to use. Speaking into the remote makes finding what you want even easier.
1,"Echo will read a book, play music, tell me a joke and work remotely to turn on a light at home while I'm out of the house."
1,The first thing I noticed about the echo wasn't speaker is very loud and clear. I can hear it from a good distance away. I'm upstairs in my house I can hear the speaker which is on the bottom floor. She responds to my music request how to make shopping list tells me the weather and gives me daily news updates I like this better than the Google home assistant since the speaker so much better
1,"works like a charm, easy to use, faster product. highly recommend."
1,"I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I'm very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price."
1,This is a great little device for a kid or anyone! My daughter loves it! Works simply and keeps her entertained and educated.
1,Great product! Great for kids great for games !!!!
1,Like the smaller size. Can read in sunlight or no light. Carry in my purse to read when have time.
1,My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
0,Great affordable device but does not have allow for android market app downloads and is basically good for simple browsing and games.
1,Amazon should improve the quality of the speaker. .
1,Bought for mother in law to play games on. Pretty simple to set up. Looked at other off brand tablets but the price on this was good so we went with it. Seems to enjoy it. Only got a call from her for how to connect to the Internet so I take that as a good sign since she's not tech savvy.
1,"I love the Fire. I can carry it in my purse plus I can read it anywhere. I took it on my cruise and every chance I had, I laid out on the deck and read books on it. It was a great buy!!"
1,The speaker sounds is rich and loud! Even at its loudest Alexa still responds when you call for her. Fast responses and ability to sync with my products is exactly how I want it to work.
1,Got it as a gift. The text of the ebooks werr crisp and very easy on the eyes. Usually with ths kindle app on ipad we distracted onto other apps or browsing but kindle helped overcome this issue. Highly recommend for anyone looking for ebook reader with good quality content library of books.
1,"I love the Amazon Fire TV. It is easy to use and setup. I use this almost everyday. Trying to cut the cord, this makes it easy to do."
1,This was a present for my mother. It was exactly what she wanted. She finds it easy to use and allows her to read Kindle as well.

1,My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books
1,"I love this tablet. It does everything that I wanted for a tablet when I was comparing between different brands. The only thing that I should have done was, purchased the 16 gig version. The space goes quickly."
0,fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
1,"I bought this for a child & she loves it, have trouble getting her away from it sometimes lol. Haven't had any issues with it in almost 2 months of having it & even with a toddler who loves to grab things that aren't hers & throw them it's held up pretty good"
1,"I bought this for Grandpa for Christmas, he has never had a computer or tablet and this was great for the first timer. Easy to use."
1,Great way to get kids introduced to using a tablet. A ton of free software is available. Guarantee seals the deal.
1,Who needs a laptop when you can do almost anything with the Kindle Fire?
1,"Good, inexpensive tablet for kids. It's nice being able to set up an account for kids that limits screen time. Amazon's Underground apps (free apps) and discounts on ebooks adds to the value.The only con is the limited built-in storage (only 4GB free after you account for the system software), so an SD card is highly recommended."
1,I love this product and use it every day. Easy to set up and connect to
1,My daughter loves her Kindle Paperwhite and reads on it every night.
1,"Basically, the tab's features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value."
1,Necessary for recharging Voyage kindle.
0,Easy to use. I'm still playing around with it. Purchase it for my son.
1,Bought these as gifts for family. Great introduction into the tablet world
1,"If you are a digital reader, you need a Kindle. This is excellent, but expensive. If you are a casual reader you will probably be happy with a less expensive Kindle. I do recommend a case."
1,I can't believe I didn't purchase this earlier. Fantastic
1,Bought it for my daughter as a gift. She was speechless
1,"The tablet has been used for netflix a lot. I am an amazon prime member on a trial basis,so the uses for the tablet are numerous."

1,"works great, easy to use, I use it in place of my phone so it's bigger"

Once you download items they become available to you offline. You can even add a 128 Gb memory card so you never run out of offline things to enjoy.The family sharing feature is excellent, particularly the one that allows you to created children profile. Your kids are protected and learn and play based on your criteria."
1,Purchased my Amazon Fire after my Roku was acting up and had complications with PS Vue. Everything runs fast and smooth over my WiFi.
1,This thing is awesome. I am learning more everyday
1,"I had to replace a kindle I've had for years and this one fit the bill. The back-lighting is a huge plus as I didn't have it before, still on the slow side but works perfect when reading."
1,I love my fire tv i like it better than cable because it cost last great to have in every room.
1,Its a good Laptop by HP. Keep getting the same HP update message even after updates have been installed is worrisome

1,Good you guys did a goood job nice workers good job
1,Replaces the stereo that has been a staple in our home.
1,A little pricy. I'm not a fan of the onboard speaker. You cannot tune it. It is preset and is a little flat and mono in sound. Otherwise I wish it would be able to easily be paired with more home items!
1,Great does all that I want it too. Will be getting another soon.
1,I LOVE this kindle!!! The battery life lasts for days.
1,"The Amazon Fire TV saved me from having to buy a new TV. My 2011 Samsung no longer supported HBO Go and other apps. Amazon Fire TV allows me to watch that and literally hundreds more channels and apps. Most are free, some you have to pay for. Easy to install and easy to use!"
1,love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
1,"Extremely worth the money. Also with kindle they offer the underground app which gives you completely free games with in app purchases that are free. The same games cost 5 to 20 bucks on android and the apple store.For the price you cannot get a better tablet, I have had many tablets and for 50 bucks you can't go wrong."
1,I love this tablet it works great. A great fit for me
1,This tablet is easy to use had a lot of great features.
1,great for first timers with technology...alexa is very smart. we not need our collectible cds anymore
1,Its a good tab for the price. Would recommend it for entertainment or kids use only.
1,Easy to set up. Works great. Helpful tutorial. Would recommend over a Roku.
1,I bought the Fire for a second tv as I already have one and like it. I bought the Fire because I am a Prime member.
1,"I already had an Amazon firestick, I really love this device because it operates faster than my firestick and I'm able to plug an Ethernet cord. Great buy!"
1,This purchase was for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.
1,"great screen, a little slow at times and screen touch could be better."
1,Bought the fire for a reader as a gift. My daughter in laws loves it.
1,This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I've bought one for all of my nieces. No other case compares to this one. It has held protected the tablet so many times from them dropping it.
1,This tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.
1,"I love my Amazon Fire tablet, I bought this all the while knowing that people had negative reviews... But honestly I don't know what they did to theirs because mines doesn't have any issues... I've had mines for over a month and still working perfectly like I just bought it yesterday..."
1,I have other kindle and got this just so everyone has access to all of our prime membership features. And so they would leave my kindle HD alone.lol. Easy setup and straightforward intuitive to use.
0,Very nice eReader - a big step up from the basic reader that I started with.
1,This was a replacement for a Kindle Paperwhite that was lost. I did find the old one after buying a new one and now everyone in the family wants it.
1,"Wife had one for years, she recommended one to a friend for her birthday and her husband purchased this one for her."
1,Purchased this tablet for my 6 year old. Indeed it's user friendly with parental control.
1,I purchased 2 kindle fires for my two youngest nieces! They have not sat them down-love them! Easy to connect & navigate
1,Very easy installation and works great! I'd highly recommend it.
1,Expectations exceeded on this. Works great. Very happy with it.
1,Bought for my nephew easy to use just could have more memory
1,I bought this for my dad and he absolutely loves it!!
1,Great way to kill time at the pool waiting for your tan to cook. Is easy to read in the brightest sun. Would like to have better search engine for new titles.
1,"I love the kindle fire. I have an I pad but I love to read on my kindle. The size is great, I like to read at night so my kindle makes it much easier. My grandson also plays games on it. It is a great product."
1,Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
1,"My two daughters really enjoy using their Fire tablet. It is really easy to use, sturdy, high definition, has tons of awesome apps integrated for children. My girls were Apple users, yet it was easy to transition."
1,Bought for my husbands birthday but I really wanted for my self. It's fantastic!
1,We absolutely love the Amazon echo aka Alexa. She is very helpful with information from the weather to new to sports. And listening to our favorite music. And plenty more. It's voice activated. Very easy to use. So anyone could do it
1,Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies
1,Easy fast and portable great fun for everyone!!!!!
1,"Really nice tablet/kindle for the price. It's good for travel and packs small. It's nice to have a ""tv"", ""book"", and the internet all in one."
1,Love the safety features for parents to protect their little ones from some content on the Internet. Love preloaded programs
1,Bought for a kid and can't be beat at the $30 sale price.
0,Like this but doesn't always get the commands correct. Doesn't answer questions the way the Google version does.
1,"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
1,"I love this I have bout three of these for my grand children and one of the wind up getting a different tablet and I was able to keep it for myself instead of returning and i just love it, It was confusing figuring out how to download on it but one of my grandchildren figured it out for me."
1,"Alexa what's the weather like today? Alexa what is 256 times 122? Alexis play soft rock. You ask, and the unit goes to the web and gets you the answer or in one case the music. What more needs to be said?"
1,My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
1,I bought the echo after reading about it and we love it. It was very easy to set up with our wireless network and everyone one in the house uses it to learn all types of information along with listening to songs.
1,Alexa is great addition to our kitchen. Still exploring all she can do. Easy set up through android.
1,It's great just wish it did not need a button to work. Otherwise love it!
1,Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.
1,My grandkids loved getting their own tablets for Christmas
1,For having a discount for this price it was a deal i couldn't pass up. Even when everywhere seems to be sold out of this item i was still able to find best buy mobile had them in stock. Makes a great stocking stuff.
1,It was a gift for my grandson . It is a great gift idea at a good price
1,"Fun, entertaining and useful. Wish the functionality was a bit more robust however amazon is making great progress with constant updates."
1,good tablet for my purpose. using when wanting to look up things when not at computer
1,"What's great about the Fire TV is it's great interface, and frankly it's affordability. If you want 4K streaming, a fast fluid interface, then this is what you want! The nVidia Shield is great, and yeah it's powerful... and plays games, but for the price, and if you just want to stream it's not worth it. The selection of Android games is so limited, don't waste your money! I've also been turned off by the Roku interface, it seems too kiddish, and just not as intuitive. I am using these Fire TV devices through out the house to stream Live TV, and my movie collection through an app called Emby. It's a fantastic experience for the whole family and saves me a bundle on rental fees from the cable company, and electricity due to it's low power consumption. If you want just want to stream, and play your home movie collection this is what you want!"
1,Works great! Use it daily for music. Like the sleek design.
1,I bought it for my nephew. The processor is quick. Good tablet for that price.
1,I love my Amazon FireTV. Very easy to hook up! Very user friendly!
1,This box is probably one of the best things that I've ever purchased!
1,This has increased my movie watching. It works so well I purchased a second one.
1,Purchased for a friends 3 year old. The parental controls are great and the price was more than reasonable for this kind of gift.
1,Love the size and quality. Easy to carry around and good screen quality
1,"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
1,"I bought this for a gift but kept it for my self. It has basic functioanality, but easy to use. This definitely not for those expecting a powerhouse tablet, but for a child it is great!"
1,"Great addition to the home. You can switch off lights in other rooms, use it to create appoint lists and dance the morning into life using the amazon music feature."
1,"No buffer, quick respond, and awesome remote control."
1,Perfect timing since this is going to replace the original kindle that was bought for my daughter. Definitely can't complain about the price
1,"As strictly an ebook, probably can't be beat. The internal illumination really is critical for all-around use."
1,Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it.
1,Easy to use and fast on. Great for sun or night A+++
1,I wish it was a little smarter right out of the box. Most of the questions I asked it at first it couldn't answer. Don't call her stupid. I did and she was still listening and she told me she is still learning. I actually started to feel bad I said it. I told her I was sorry and she forgave me for it. My wife listens to music everyday and it sounds great. The built in mics can pick up your voice from just about anywhere in the room and you don't have to raise your voice. After I did a little research and read up about all of the things it can do I could spend month's and still not use all of the features.
1,"Ive always been a kindle fan, you can play games, take pics, read books, listen to music, even go online, and the parental controls make it very easy to protect kids."
1,Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
0,"My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working."
0,You need gooooood wifi for this. If the wifi isn't good like it's in and out this will not work that good. You also need the app to set up alexa. I would only recommend this if you have great wifi
1,Great Roku TV; wish I had a separate remote for local channels
1,Great and super for reading and graphics are clear a concise
1,"To date, it's working fine. I'm hoping that it continues to work it's usually not the charger that goes bad for me though, it's the cord!"
1,Had previously been using third gen kindle (2011) but this paperwhite is a great upgrade. Love the backlight and new font.
1,Bought for little sister and it's very entertaining for her. Keeps her busy
1,Nice device I like to use it to read books online.
1,"not a i-pad that's for sure, but doesn't meant I don't enjoy it. If you have amazon prime membership - this is a no brainer. its not so preciousness allows me pass it to others without the stress."
0,Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
1,Family had more fun with this over the holidays. Between it telling jokes and playing music on demand it made for a great time
1,I got these for my children for Christmas they are great for them for the size
1,I got this for my 7 yo and she loves it. Used the kindle for her reading
1,Love the Amazon Echo will recommend this to all my friends.
1,I use the device to watch movie and my son watch YouTube on for his alphabet
1,Nice product works well with my stuff easy to use and set up
1,"(accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one."
1,This is the fourth one I have bought. I love them. So easy to read books or go online.
1,"This is a big improvement over my old Kindle. The Paperwhite screen is perfect, and I'm loving reading on a Kindle more than ever. Read on!"
1,I bought this just to have a new device to play with. I love it now though and love Amazon Prime.
1,"It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter."
1,"I have bought this kindle for almost one month, and almost use it every night. It's comfortable for your eyes. I like it."
1,It was for my nephew for his birthday and he loved it. So that's my review. If you decide to buy a Amazon Fire for someone's birthday or Christmas they will love it.
1,"I like it. it's better to read books online even I owned iPhone, iPad,and itc."
1,Purchased the Amazon Fire HD 10 16GB for my mother and mother in law for Christmas. They LOVE their Kindle and the large screen is very easy on their aging eyes.
1,"Good sounding speaker, using your voice becomes more natural as you use it. If you have prime the included music is a great deal."
1,not necessary
1,I love the new Eco. It is especially fun to listen to all the great music.
0,"Limited apps, screen not as easy to touch. Good for the price."
1,Helps me turn my lights off or dimmed. Wake up to news and weather. Love it.Memory aid.
1,Yes perfect for a bonus room can have Netflix and movies all at the same time
1,"Got this for my wife for reading Kindle and ordering on Amazon. It is a nice unit, has quick response time and was a good value."
0,"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
1,"Great for streaming music, weather forecasts, sports updates, news briefings, etc. Works as advertised. Only drawback is not as knowledgeable as the google home. Has some limitations, but works great with suggested applications."
1,"I initially thought this was a gimmick product and dismissed it for quite a while... until my wife requested it for her home-office work situation. Alexa is now her best and most convenient friend, both as an office assistant and as a home /kitchen advisor and entertainment source. Alexa was a bit expensive but has certainly earned her keep!"
1,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
1,No problems. Easy to setup and use. Streaming videos is pretty darn good with very little lag over my wireless router. I use a Netgear Nighthawk x6. Recomend getting the firestick tv. Great bang for the buck.
1,It works great I love it. It plays music and answers all of your questions
1,Works good and for $35 buy 2! Does exactly what I needed
1,I enjoy this product and HIGHLY recommended. You can not go wrong in purchasing this Alexa. It plays my smooth jazz while working in my office.
1,I bought the tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!
1,I enjoy my kindle fire very much. Great price. Buy
1,It's a great product I suggest that other people buy it
1,I have really enjoy this new kindle. I have the older version and this was a great upgrade.It is very good on my eyes and it is also great for night/bed reading
1,It's a great screen and extremely lightweight to hold. Perfect!
1,I was able to get this for a great price an my son is able to read books and of course play games. Great price and purchase!!!
1,We are very pleased with the Amazon Echo. The sound quality when you use it to play music is great. I have used it for a timer in the kitchen and that is a big help. This was purchased by my husband for me as a birthday gift and I am very happy with it and so is he. Jeopardy is fun to play.
0,"This is a great product and I did research it before buying 3 of them. Having said that, I didn't realize the apps such as Instagram and Madden mobile, we're not available on Amazon. This was a BIG disappointING factor for the young people using the product. The other big complaint we have with this product is the length of the charging cord. WAY TOO SHORT."
1,"Love this Echo Alexa. Gives me weather, news, appointments, unlimited music of Amy type & a thousand other things. Everyone needs Alexa!!!!!"
1,"Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device."
1,I purchase two of this tablets and I have to say I haven't had any issues with them. Perfect for kids.
1,"bought this during black Friday, best deal ever. would recommeded people"
1,The echo makes life easier and fun. Great speaker!
1,Love having the Echo in the kitchen/living area! Sure wish you could link it to Apple Music.
1,"From the small design, this unit packs big power. Although the newer model has an external memory port for sd cards that make this even better, the amount of endless apps, and movie choices(if you have prime) makes this essential. You can still order shows and movies without prime, and many apps are free. I would recommend the newer model and at least a 32gb sd card for heavy users, or if kids will be using it to download apps, as the internal memory runs out pretty quick."
1,Excellent for a first time ereader. Worth the buy.
1,"My first one didn't work, but was easily exchanged at Best Buy. New one works great, I watch streaming tv on it thru the PS Vue app. The Fire box is much quicker and smoother than the Fire stick."
1,The pages look like actual pages from a book to allow for easier reading. Bought this for my mother in her 60's and she loves it!
1,"Kindle paperwhite is a great asset for all kinds of readers at an affordable price! Lightweight and easy to throw in your purse, backpack, etc. no glare in the sun"
0,Absolutely love my Alexa but I am still figuring it out. I purchased it majority for listening to music & I love that. I ask questions & her response is I'm not sure or I don't know sounds yet. I know she can do more but I'm lost right now.
1,"Our entire family is loving the Echo, easy to use, very smart, and sounds great.."
1,"Good purchase. If there is a way to make the kindle flash less when navigating, it will be even better"
1,I absolutely LOVE my kindle paper white. I read a ton of books and love having all of them with me at all times
1,Right out of the box it was great and have had no issues to date.
1,"Great Christmas presents. Bought 8. Made my nieces, nephews and grandkids- ages two to twenty-very happy. Nice size and convenient."
1,"I love to ask Alexa a daily joke, she can tell me the weather...the news...love her"
0,this is way over priced
1,I love using my Kindle fire for reading books from Amazon.com
1,I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym
1,"Due to intl travel restrictions, I didn't want to risk my laptop. This inexpensive tablet fit the bill. I was able to upload ppts and other work on this device and was able to link up with an LCD projector for my overseas work. The built-in ads were a miniscule distraction given the quality of the device and the cost."
1,The echo has been a lot of fun and really adds to the convenience of my day.
1,"I bought one for myself and a few others for a raffle. This is a great tablet for a great price. It doesn't have all of the apps that the google store has, but Amazon underground has some great free apps. It's got good external storage options and a fast processor. I highly recommend."
1,This product is easy to set up and navigate. Great for catching up on missed tv shows.
1,Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
1,great streaming device for non smart hdtv. a must for any home
1,This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
1,I bought this kindle for my 6yr old so he would stop using his sisters KindleHD. It wasn't a planned buy but who could beat $49.99!!! Added this from 'Santa' to the gifts for Christmas.
1,"The Amazon Fire 7 exceeded all expectations that I had for this device. It works great as an e-reader, and is a functional tablet as well. You may not get the stunning resolution of an iPad or higher priced tablet, but it certainly gets the job done when watching videos or tv shows. Amazon's app store is also better than expected. The expandable memory (micro SD card) is a huge plus for me also."
1,"I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I'm loving it! I have an older Samsung ""Smart"" TV, but Samsung has stopped updating the Smart Hub for my model. The Amazon Fire TV gets the latest updates from the Apps (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc...) , so I know everything will work smoothly!"
1,"Bought this tablet for my wife. Basic email, Facebook and web surfing. Does everything you need to and for the price no other tablet came close. Second fire tablet we bought. I am using mine to write this"
1,"The new paperwhite is a big improvement over the first generation Kindle I had. The text is much more crisp and easier to read, and the backlit screen makes reading possible in any lighting condition."
1,"I like buying stuff from Bestbuy because, it's always seems cheaper than others!!!"
1,"I got this as a gift for a student and they loved it! very responsive and easy to add apps to, just buy expandable memory and it was good to go!"
1,Replaced an older kindle with this new one. Great product. My wife really enjoys using it.
1,This E-reader makes reading ebooks very easy on the eyes and provides for a beautiful experience. The product feels like quality but gathers finger print marks on the back quickly if it doesn't have a case. Overall the e-reading experience is excellent though as the lighting and colors come across very pleasantly.
0,You have to purchase to many accessories for it to work.
1,I love this tablet! Great price and it gives the ability for the user to do so much!
1,We own an Echo and purchased this one for my in-laws. We really love ours. My in-laws love theirs as well. Easy to setup and use. Amazon is constantly adding capabilities. It is a great gift for a great price.
1,"This item is very helpful, it is useful for all ages and I use it everyday."
1,Not a bad tablet if u like reading. If u prefer AOSP and customs Android OSes I suggest the Nexus 7
1,"Amazon has made a very affordable upgrade. Fast streaming, a responsive remote control and easy to set up. Picture is crisp and HD all the way. Supports 4K so future upgrades are a forgone conclusion."
1,Love it it works wonders great job greate product.will recommend to any friend
1,"Daughter gave me one last year, so I returned the favor this year! She's thrilled and obsessed (her words)!"
1,I do love my Amazon tablet. Wish they had some apps that google play and apple have like kidstub. But other than that great tablet...
1,Works great time to cut off the dish this is all I need to watch you get everything.
1,It is easy to use and has many apps. I would recommend
1,This product is great and user friendly. It's easily accessible and has plenty of apps and Channels to watch!
1,"Awesome tablet for kids, they love it. Would recommend it to anyone"
1,"Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark"
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is compact, yet big enough to feel book sized. The natural bridge screen is quite easy on your eyes and is visible in any light - quite an accomplishment! The battery charge lasts a long time so you don't feel in danger of the Paperwhite going dead on you. When I went to Guatemala, I was even able to find a browser that allowed me to get a message back home on my email using the Paperwhite! I got this one for my wife. If you like to read, I think you would enjoy this little gem."
1,gave up old tablet due to battery issues apps take getting used to but nice tablet
0,I would opt for an iPad rather than the Kindle just because of the ease of researching books by authors etc. the only advantage of the Kindle is the attractive comparative price.
1,I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
1,I especially like the variable lighting which allows me to read at night without any external light or in the brightest outdoor light.
0,"Does what you need, but because it has amazon's name on it, it's expensive"
1,"The Amazon Fire TV product is great, highly recommend it to anyone. Best Buy's service on the sale was not. I ordered the item online for an in store pick up the next day. Went to pick it up and they said it was scheduled for delivery to a home address in 10-15 days. Although they had plenty in stock, Their only option was to cancel the order and redo the sale. While this may not seem like a big deal it was not how I wanted the purchase processed, since I was getting bonus miles with a specific credit card."
1,I RECOMMEND THIS ITEM WoRTH ThE $$$$$$$ saving me tons on my cable bill
1,Very little buffering. Easy to use. Worth the extra money if you get a lot of buffering when trying to stream.
1,"love the echo. plays any songs you want or ask or weather, ect"
1,"Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. Such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. His brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. He's happy! I also bought me one!"
0,Got this for my daughter & grandson for their birthday.
1,love this tablet it was a great gift and it worked nice
1,Great price and lots of free apps! Definitely happy I purchased it!
1,I brought it for my best friend and she love it very much.I will buy one for myself when it has some discount.
1,"Small, compact, great for the beach. Easy to read in the bright sunlight.Love it, you won't be disappointed."
1,"pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
1,"My husband is bed bound and sometimes very weak. The kindle is great for him ,light easy to use and the back light allows him to read in bed without waking me to turn the lights on."
1,Its great it moves fast only problem the battery don't last all that long but its a good tablet I like
1,this was my first Amazon purchase and since then I have purchased a Tap and a dot. All are easy to setup and work flawlessly.
1,"Seems to be relatively user friendly but as a new tablet owner, I would have appreciated having some basic instructions come with it rather than have to learn everything by trial and error. I'm sure I still do not understand many of the capabilities this tablet has to offer."
1,"There is no substitute to the original Amazon Echo (tall cylinder). This unit has the turn knob on top for volume, has a much louder speaker, and is the basis of how Alexa was originally developed!"
1,Purchased for daughter for school - meets all expectations.
1,"Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it"
1,"Great color, great item, i bought it as a replacement for another brand, very happy with this purchase"
1,Great piece of equipment. Created rings around Apple TV. With Kodi install ....the best ever!
1,"I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!"
1,"I'm very happy with this purchase.It plays a good selection of music, sets alarms, etc."
1,"I was glad to get this device to help me ""cut the cord"" and get away from the cable TV high rates."
1,"I bought two for my grandchildren , 5-8 they both love them , easy to work .fast, and has excellent parental control feature ."
1,Simple easy to use. Plug and play so to speak. You should read the manual that comes installed on it. Can read anywhere with no glare at all. tt even has a browser for the web that is in the preliminary stages but it is pretty good.
0,Does what it is suppose to do - power adaptor / charger.Three stars because it's overpriced.
0,Doesn't do much except radio and a couple of games. Wait for future skills before buying
1,I got this box on special. This box is faster than amazon fire tv stick and perfect for all of u wanna convert your tv in smart tv. If you have amazon prime you can get more movies and shows
1,the tablet was a great gift and my kids loved it best buy online is great
1,"This is easily the best media player around. Solid hardware, blazing fast and snappy nice user interface and a ton of apps. Highly recommend"
1,REASONABLY PRICED. HAS MANY FEATURES OF TABLET COSTING MUCH MORE. DAUGHTER REALLY LIKES IT.
1,Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
1,"Echo is great for playing music. You can stream most songs with a Prime membership. I want to set up lists and calendar and even control lights, etc. I just need some time to figure out how I would actually use those features."
1,"Great first time tablet for a beginner , no problems yet. Very happy with purchase"
1,"exactly what we were looking for, backlit display is awesome for reading in bed."
1,This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.
1,This is one of the best buys for the price. Amazon outdid themselves with this one for what you get for the price. This is an excellent gift.
1,Got this over the google home because I felt it was more refined than the google's offering. Thwe most useful feature IMO is the ability to play music by just saying what you want to listen to not having to search through your own digital library or CD's. The other is the home automation which is great and very simple to use.
1,I bought 2 tablets for my cousins and they really love it! The tablet is easy to use and very handy.
1,"Very user friendly, and easy to set up. I would recommend this to everyone, especially Amazon Prime members as there are more options. Also no lagging time, as I experienced with other streaming devices."
1,"my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement"
1,Awesome tablet just what I wanted for my son he has loved it!
1,"The fire TV 4k is one of the best streaming devices I've ever owned. This version plays the media seamlessly. The 4k picture it displays is awesome. The only down side, there is no Vudu 4k."
1,Was looking for a nice size tablet when a great price..so far they love the tablet
1,I bought this product for my 12 year old niece. She was extremely happy with it especially the camera feature. It is durable and easy to carry around. Great product!
1,Great tablet for kids my son liked and easy to play with
1,I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I've had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job.
1,"Maybe it's because their older or have had other tablets, but this was the easiest setup ever!"
1,"My family and I are enjoying Alexa. Great for playing music, setting timers, adding to shopping list, etc. Still finding new and useful things to do with it."
1,Funny thing since Steve Jobs has passed away techies have been waiting for the next great thing from apple and sadly its more of the same well Amazon did all techies a favor with this invention something Apple should have done with Siri but didn't. Hands free Alexa who hears your command 99 percent of the time instead of 50 haha aka Siri. Team this up with a smart hub like Phillip lightbulbs and a nest system and a harmony hub and you living like Ironman.
1,This kindle has better resolution and contrast ratio.It is light and comfortable. I would recommend this device at deal price.
1,It's ok for the price and what u can do on it I would buy again
1,good and helpfull i like it get it its good my kids love it
1,Very good product. I really enjoy it. Easy to use.
1,i'm glad i took the opportunity to buy the echo especially when it was on sale!
1,"I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise. I like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and I also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and I like that. Generally, I am happy with this purchase."
1,No bells or whistles but does what I want for the price.
1,"Easy to use, great product. Cost is great, many features."
0,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
1,My grandkids love to use it. It has so much for them to choose and they learn too.
1,Wanted to be able to read outdoors w/out glare and also at night w/out a light on. Already have laptop and smart phone so don't need another connected device. Works beautiful in all lighting conditions.
1,"The item that I needed was very good in value and easy to find in the store The cost was reasonable and exactly what I was looking for, which was what I needed for the new printer that I also purchased at Best Buy. thank you"
1,I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation.
1,brought them for my grandkids easy to use and they love them and the price was right
1,"Got this for my wife's birthday but the grandkids and I use it more. The grand kids use it to spell, we don't get the "" how do you spell this"" anymore, which is worth the price alone. This unit does so much more sound machine, alarm, timer, reminder, it even calls my wife,s phone when she looses it. Best purchase I made in a long while Love it."
1,I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount
1,Replaced the Roku so I could have Alexa change my shows.
1,Amazing item that everyone in the whole family enjoys.
0,"Slightly slow. However, really good for the price. Also... these Amazon tablets don't use the normal google app store... they use the Amazon app store, which is not as extensive as the Google App store. This can be a significant drawback."
1,This worked well as an extension of the Amazon Echo to cover our basement living area.
1,Love that it is so small .it fits in my purse. I wish I could have gotten a different color
1,This is a great tablet for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure it all out. I would recommend going ahead and purchasing a sd card bc the storage space ran out very quickly.
1,"Overall, this tablet is great for kids and adults. It's not overpriced and you can do a lot with it. Including, browsing the web, downloading paid or free apps, downloading books free or paid, listening to music, shopping right through amazon, storing files, and plenty more. I wouldn't trade this tablet for any other."
1,"Pretty good at understanding what you say. Can't do everything You would think or hope but, for The most part, gets the job done."
1,I cannot believe this came with the SD Card slot. This is by far the best amazon tablet purchased
1,I read the reviews online before purchasing and this product is for real Excellent.
1,"Simple to setup, use and update. We listen to music 3x as much as we used to as a family since it is so easy to use Amazon prime music or Pandora."
1,"I bought this item for grand daughter, she loves it"
1,"Great product and only $40! I purchased 2 of them along with the compatible SanDisk 200gb micro SD cards to max out the storage capability. I was able to copy my child's stored tv shows & moves on to the sd cards from my PC's hard drive, now they can watch their shows on the go, it makes car trips a lot easier!  I also purchased Skullcandy Bluetooth headphones for each of them (got em' for $10 during Christmas). They paired with the Kindle in seconds, no trouble at all. + Kindle's customer support is awesome if you need them, their service is like no other..."
1,I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
1,"Very excellent product, I am very excited about using it!"
1,It was a fun gift for the family. Alexa does many things and is easy to work. The sound quality of the speaker is great. Overall a great purchase.
1,This is a great product for watching movies especially if you're tired of paying those high cable prices.
1,Loved Alexa. This gadget is so handy and easy to use.
1,Very easy and dependable. It fits perfect in a purse or pocket to take to work to use on breaks.
1,have the amazon fire stick and box the box is alot faster worth the price love it have 2 of them
1,"Fire tv is good for watching prime movies, but great for making a easy Kodi box."
1,Bought as a gift but have one as well...love it! Great price!
1,get this and you won't go wrong. I love the speed of it and how easy it is to set up. My child loves the ability to play games esp if you get the game controller with it as well.
1,Really like it but Alexa Search uses Bing which is very limited compared to Bing on line. Wish you could choose different search engine - I like Google over Bing. Thinking of getting Tap as well.
1,"I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet."
1,This is a great tablet. I bought it for my daughter and it's very easy for her to use.
1,"I got this for my mum and she wanted it to watch movies in bed or download a book. It works well for this, but a manual would have been a boon as she is older and not tech savvy. It's not always easy or convenient for an older person to use new tech without a struggle. This wasn't too bad in the end, and she is enjoying it."
1,It's a great product that allowed me to cancel cable television.
1,We already own one of these. Purchased another for my mom. We all love it. Connects easily to the Echo and all other apps we normally use.
1,"I love the size of this, it's the size of a book! The only thing I don't like is the lock screen has ads."
1,The Echo is a really nice to have item. My wife bought one for me for my birthday last year and I bought another for our bedroom.
1,I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it
1,my four year old has trashed this one again. it really is great but I need to find ways to make it so the glass doesn't break. the computer itself is wonderful cracked like crazy and I cant cut my fingers.
1,My grandchild grabbed it and giggled. I love anything that makes a loved one happy.
1,"I purchased 3 of these and I loved them, until I tried a Samsung tablet. I rather have a Samsung vs the Amazon fire, but they are great for the price."
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite does the job it is supposed to do, but noticeably slower than the methods I have used previously (iPad, computer, phone). I think Amazon needs to bump up the processing power of this device to compete with other tablets and devices. I would recommend this to a friend, but with some reservation."
1,Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job's Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books.
1,my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
1,It is fun to use ... requesting music ... asking for sports updates ... asking for weather forecasts ... shopping lists ... much more not even tried yet ...
0,it wasn't worth my money to be honest but it is good whenever your bored
1,"I currently own 3 Kindles, including this one, so I am very familiar with the Kindle Fire tablets. I love that this new Fire has updated the look and feel. I can add a memory card to download books, movies, photos and games on so I can take them with me when I'm on the go and don't picture, which I love! So for $50, it's a great value. There are only 2 things that I wish this Kindle had: there is no sleep/wake function and it doesn't have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my TV, but again, for the price it's a great product."
1,"Simple, easy to use. Good parental controls. I also loved the price."
1,"This is the best tablet I have ever owned. Everyone in my house now have one. Lightweight and perfect for reading e-books, playing games or just about anything. It even has parental controls. Very easy to use."
1,"My wife and I have enjoyed using ""Alexa"" and look forward to it getting more apps to use."
1,"Works great, easy to use for my 4 year old. I can adjust settings easily. Easy set up"
1,"Excellent performance, Alexa really performs, outperforms apple and roku."
1,"Picked this up for a spare tablet, and at $49 it was a no brainer. Videos, games, books, music work great. lots of capabilities. Screen looks great and it does feel a lot sturdier as it was a more expensive tablet. if you can't find an app, you can install Google Play store (have to search for it online for instructions). I did return this tablet as we specifically bought this to be use while on the treadmill, and you can't access Bravo or E! Tv. They only make apps for iOS (iPad/iPod/iPhone) other than that...its not a problem with Amazon or their tablet, I blame it on Bravo.Excellent tablet otherwise.. I will definitely buy it again in the future. Just don't need it at this moment."
1,I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
1,"It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price"
0,"For me, it is only great for playing english-language music. I may try to connect to light switches and socketsss through something like nest, but until then, answering questions about history and societyit fails."
1,Great product. Love that I can download Kindle Unlimited and read for $9.99 per month....a great savings.
1,"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
1,"Pleasant experience, I still love paper books, but you get used to the versatility of the kindle"
1,"Great all around product. Sleek and does its job, since purchased I haven't looked back"
1,"Any one lower than this one is not worth it, and if you're a serious reader you will not put this down."
0,I bought this as a gift for a less technically inclined person as a gateway into learning tablets and apps. It was a good gift.
1,Was a christmas gift for my daughter she loves it.
1,This has a lot of great features for kids and for parents who want to protect them. My kids love having their own.
1,Access to millions of songs with a prime membership
1,Lightweight easy read easy page turning self adjusting read light great too.
1,This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
1,I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
1,"I previously had a Kindle Fire, which I liked, but this is much easier on the eyes for reading, and the battery lasts for days instead of hours. It's great."
1,"Great for the price! Love that there are so many free apps, games, etc I can down load through amazon prime. There are some apps not available for down load like Instagram but not a big deal. Happy with purchase!"
1,Nice clear picture and easy to follow instructions for use of box.
1,always learning new things that it can do to make my life easier! if the speaker was just a little louder it would have gotten 5 stars.
1,Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.
1,"I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. Her only disappointment is that she is unable to access the ""Musicality"" app."
1,I really liked the many facets of the Tablet. Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.
1,I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point.
1,"Fun and capable device. I would like to see it be able to link to my calendar on my iPhone, I may have just not found that program yet. My kids love interacting with it."
1,I love the updated features with this kindle. Although I did like the length of the Fire.
1,Best product ever!!!!! I would buy another and another lol it's great for everything music movies etc
1,The fire tv box works far better than the Roku 3. The picture quality is excellent. Nervous works great. The interface is better than Roku. Overall the Fire tv box is well worth the money.
1,I got this for my brother as an early Christmas gift. He has never owned a tablet before and not super tech savvy. He really enjoyed it and never put it down over the holiday weekend. It was easy for him to use and adapt to.
1,good product for this price. I like my Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet
1,"Weather, traffic, music plus over 1,000 more skills and counting!"
1,Great product and works very well with no buffering on wifi.
1,Very high quality item good sound. However preferred the google knowledge of the google home so ended up returning this item.
1,"Better than I thought From a techie guy... I'm a big geek I have tons of boxes and electronic toys I even have several Google TVs which are now outdated. I'm pretty blown away by this box, and the amount of content apps available. For instance the unknown Pluto TV app has over 100 HD streaming stations. Some of them obviously aren't great, but it's definitely enough to keep you busy. For hours on end. Some of the channels have an hour or two of programming and just loop over and over again, but there's enough content on other channels to keep you busy for days.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider passes through the HBO, Netflix, etc programming through to this box. So for instants if you had an outdoor TV, TV in an attic or basement, you don't need to add another cable box to watch movies. .It has all the standard bells and whistles like Netflix, Hulu, and those sort of services . The box is fast, does what it's advertised. I have a Ultra HDTV. Although ultra high definition content is scarce these days, this box probably has the most ultra high definition content of any other unit. Granted a lot of those ultra high definition videos are of Flyovers of nature type videos. if you have Amazon prime, then you can stream several of their in-house shows in ultra high definition.Read more"
1,Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on.
1,I love this product! The price is great for such a deal.
1,Works great. Easy to set time limits and goals. Easy to set up multiple profiles. Excellent product. As advertised.
1,The perfect fix for any book lovers delight. Allows you to see in the dark and maneuver without needing to shine a light on the device.
1,"THIS IS MY 2ND TABLET AND THERE IS NO BETTER TABLET FOR THE PRICE, GREAT SCREEN AND FEATURES, VERY RELIABLE, RECOMMENDED FOR READING BOOKS, SURFING THE WEB OR KIDS, CHEAPER THAN MOST KID TABLETS!"
1,"I bought this for my wife for mothers day. She likes it a lot even though I use it more than her. It stays in the kitchen, so we can listen to music while we cook and hang out. The kids love it too."
1,This is my second paperwhite and I love it. I already recommend the paperwhite to my friends.
1,This product is great! It allows me to watch whatever I want to watch from old TV shows to movies in the theater. I love this product.
1,Good product. It is easy to use and it organized item very good.
1,The Amazon Fire Stick is compatible with a Samsung television
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift and my sister loves it! Great price on Black Friday as well!
1,Has greT sound quality. And picks up my voice from the other room.
0,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
1,The tablet has been a great gift for a 10 year old
1,Easily to set up. Second Amazon Echo for the house. Only drawback is speaking too loud causing a response from the first Echo and an Echo Dot we have in the home.
1,Absolutely love this thing! It controls my lights and works as a fantastic alarm clock. This thing has plenty of awesome features. It's basically Jarvis in my house
0,Bought for my grandson he doesn't like it it's to slow..
1,This does everything I would ask of it. No complaints.
1,I like that it has an Automatic backlight adjustment
1,This tablet was purchased for a gift given to a friend with no prior experience using a tablet. The tutorial given in the beginning made it simple to understand.
1,This was bought for my daughter and she has not stopped playing with it since she get it. I highly recommend this easy to use tablet.
1,Alexa makes this worth it. AI is intelligent and does get smarter as you talk to it. She has some jokes too. This works even better with a Prime membership. I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't fond of the tube. I can see myself knocking it down. The sound wasn't full or rich enough for me compared to Bose.
1,Has worked very well with Sling TV and other streaming apps.
1,Good tablet durable lots of apps just right for 3 year old
1,We own one of Amazon Fire and like it so much we ordered another one.
1,"Great tablet and pretty easy to set up , front and back camera and good resolution I just love my tablet"
1,This was a good proce and does what it needs too for the price!
1,I like to use my refrigerator it works like a champ and it freeze
1,Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
1,It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.
1,I have enjoyed these little tablets and now they come with the micro sad card port making it better
1,Me and my son love this thing and we use it all the time to turn the lights on and off in my house we have a lot of Phillips hue lights. The only thing I don't know why this thing will not change the color of them. But it will turn them on and off and set them at a low and high brightness
1,Really like reading a paper. My eyes feel good. I put many books inside and easy to read. Like it.
0,"It will not charge in USB on computer, have to take it in."
1,Alexa is great with the minor things like weather and music. I really enjoy how easy the set up is for other smart devises and the ease of operation.
1,Purchased four of these for xmas gifts and theyIt
1,Lots and lots of channel to watch. better viewing and entertaining to use.
1,"Gave to my mom for Christmas. She had an older kindle, loves the fire, too. Has more features. She is happy."
1,"We started with the Nabi the 2nd edition when my son was 4. Then came a few other RCA tablets that ran out of memory or quit charging in 6 months. But I just can't justify the cost of the ipad for my 8 year old that dropped my work ipad and I had to pay $250. The Amazon fire tablet is the perfect fit for his video game playing. Since I am a prime member he loves that he can download music, books and videos for free. Being a prime member is almost necessary to make this tablet worth anything. You can only buy amazon gift cards no google play or itunes for this. So let the grandparents know. I like that it has multiple users so I can restrict the time and what he is able to view/play."
1,I bought the device for my grand babies and they absolutely love it. My son says they pretty much haven't put it down since Christmas and I may need to buy another one so they don't have to share.
1,It's a great table for adults or children!! I do recommend purchasing this item!
1,The Amazon Fire is a great tablet and it is very easy to use.
1,Has all streaming media platforms. It even supports 4K resolution.
1,Great tablet for grandson to watch videos. Good sound and picture.
1,I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
1,I have wanted this tablet for a while. I had to get rid of my Galaxy Tab 3 and when I got the chance I went and bought this one. I am so happy I got this.
1,"I purchased this for my dad as his first tablet and he loves it. Technically, it's not a powerhouse but for the price it's the nicest little tablet you can get your hands on. It's perfect for a child, to use in the kitchen while cooking or kill time in the bathroom. Looks-wise it's pleasing and feels good in the hand."
1,Excellent streaming device offered at a reasonable price.
1,I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
1,I love this echo everybody in my family loves the echo. kids play music ask Alexa questions all the time and they are adding new things all the time.
1,Excellent product and makes reading books very easy. Very light and allows you to have access to numerous books on the go. The E-paper display makes reading really enjoyable and does not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the displays on phones and tablets
1,This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
1,"This was a great price for a entry level tablet, It can do all the things I need it to well like Netflix and checking the weather."
1,Beach necessity for avid reader! It is a must have if you want to read in direct sunlight!
1,I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.
1,"I absolutely love this product. I set alarms, listen to music and ask science questions while doing homework with my kid. Would recommend for sure."
1,There is absolutely nothing that I don't just love about my kindle. The built in light is a nice addition that my old kindle didn't have. I would highly recommend the kindle paper white .
1,"Unfortunately we did not purchase one of these to keep for ourselves, we gave both of them away to our children at Christmas!"
1,Those who enjoy reading! Has great life span on the battery and enjoy having access to a interior light for easy reading.
1,I have been using the Amazon fire tv stick. Getting the box is so much smoother.
1,easy setup and works flawlessly but always wants you to purchase Amazon products
1,"Pros: - A beefy machine for the price;- Great battery management in standby.- a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price. Cons:- Proprietory Amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference- The app selection is limiting. But you can install google play and get all you need from there. - Brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but completely usable - a compromise for the low price- had some wi-fi issues on several occasions (compatibility issues?). It is a little weak, also-7"" may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird (long an narrow)Overall, a reasonable tab that does the job done (not many games, though) for a minimal investment"
1,good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
1,"I wasn't sure if I needed this, since I heard some are good some are not worth it if you own a smart phone! But, I bought one anyway! I now own two Alexa's. One for the living room and one for my bedroom. I love the simplicity of having two!!"
1,Great little tablet and it does everything I need it to do. Love playing games and keeping up with social media with it!
1,Our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options.
1,"After your initial kindle library download, the battery should last 2-3 weeks with the backlight close to the highest setting."
1,"Upgrade from Fire Stick and it's the best decision I made. It's fast, easy to setup, and came with loaded apps. NO MORE CABLE FEE."
1,I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.
1,Having the freedom to pay foe what you want to watch instead of a package.
1,The Amazon TV is great for non Smart TVs. I bought this to be able to replace an old Google Chromecast. This gave me an option to hard wire into my network and utilize it like I did with my old Google Chromecast
1,I would have like Alexa to help me f8nd stuff in YouTube and other apps instead of typing it out though other than that it was an awesome investment
1,My kids had a good time with the kindle and now I feel like best buy is the best store ever.
1,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
1,"good for the price, better than i expected. highly reccommend"
0,"Maybe I didn't give it enough time. I had it a few weeks before I returned it. I just didn't feel the love. I see a lot of potential. I was wanting to control some of my WIFI connected devices like my thermostat, TV, and some lighting. but it took a lot of programming to get it there. So maybe after they do the heavy programming for outside devices then I'll try it again."
1,I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
1,seems to do all that it says it can do and is durable
0,doesnt do me any good without a cord to go with it
1,Good reader for travelers. It allows for people to read in a variety of environments.
1,I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife.
1,Absolutely love it! Battery life lasts long and great screen with the back light.
1,Easy to use for kids and elders. Very Basic functions.
1,"I bought an Echo Dot that I connected to an existing bluetooth speaker, but the speaker was too old and kept losing connection. I went to Best Buy for a new speaker but while there, I realized that buying the Amazon Echo would give me a decent speaker as well as coverage in the rest of my house. Perfect!"
1,"The 7"" Amazon Kindle Fire is the best starter tablet on the market, which I have purchased and gave a presents to high school and college graduates..."
1,This was a gift for my girlfriend a she loves it wow
1,the paperwhite makes reading in all conditions a pleasure.
1,This is perfect cause my nephew is more calm.. this tablet is awesome. He loves it.
1,"I think that for the price, this product is fantastic. It is more than acceptable for media consumption. I highly recommend it for those on a budget or need a secondary consumption device."
1,"This is so great, music, news, questions answered."
1,Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage.
1,"Me and my family love Alexa, she is very important part of our day."
1,"Works great, don't have any trouble with this charger."
1,"For the price you really can't beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!"
1,Better than I thought easy to set up small enough where it dosent take up much room and sound is good
1,Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football
1,It's been a year and the tablet is still working great.
1,Can use it for best streaming. Can watch all the shows in best quality. Nice piece of equipment when we have no T V
1,It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!
1,"Excelent product, cheap and great quality... love it"
0,Hard to figure out to use this tablet can't figure out how to close apps. Also says no storage to run wifi. Lastly bought three of them and one is not working wish it came with a user guide
1,"I got this so that I could read books on it that I didn't have an actual book version of. I like it because I am able to take it with me on trips and occupy myself that way. Also, I am able to have my daughter read books on it too. The battery life is great and I have just purchased another one for my fianc√©."
1,"Echo is more polished and ahead of the curve. It integrates well with my smart lights and plays music through Spotify. Needs integration with my Fire Stick, but Harmony Hub is a great solution for this for now."
1,"Small, light weight, bright ... this is the best Kindle yet."
1,"We love the echo for music if you have Amazon Prime. Just ask her to play a song, artist, or even genre and she does. We also love using her for timers, reminders, and to create grocery lists."
1,I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
1,What else can I say. This is a must have device for anyone willing to dump cable TV.
1,"Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words."
1,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
1,"Everything you need to surf the web, watch videos and take care of business. . .all in the palm of your hand."
1,"Enjoy how easy it is to set up and use. Since I enjoy old movies, this unit is good for A movie lover like me."
1,and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
1,Just what I wanted and expected.
1,"Until the tablet stopped being responsive, I spent many hours enjoying casino games. I used the tablet primarily for gaming but also I was able to get news on occasion.I bought the tablet because my laptop had ceased to function. If I don't get a new laptop, I will most likely get another tablet, perhaps an upgrade."
1,"I waited a while before going with Amazon to start automating my home. I had considered Google Home, but since I wanted to have multiple rooms linked, it was much cheaper to go the Echo route since the Dot was only $40/each on sale. It has more after-market apps and seems to be integrated into more home automation systems (lights, TVs, alarm systems, etc.) than Google Home. It is also much sleeker and attractive to have sitting in your living room than Google. It is a bit of a novelty at the moment but is quickly becoming an integral part of our house.I was a little disappointed in the pricing ($140 on sale) since the Echo Dot, as I mentioned, was only $40 and does everything the Echo does, minus a better speaker. The Dot does have a 3.5mm output jack, so you can hook it up to a sound system or Bluetooth speaker. So, if you do not use your Echo to listen to music, it was a little overkill for the price."
1,"I'm a PC guy that wanted to try a tablet without investing a lot as a first step, so $50 was a great way to get in. Its fine for browsing, photos, checking email and weather. So far so good."
1,"I live alone, so I got this so I could hear another voice. I've got it programmed to play music from my era. It sounds great. I love it !"
1,"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
1,Great Product. I have recommended to all my family and friends
1,First off I would say Best Buy is where I get all my electronics. Nothing like touching and testing something before you buy. This is a great little device. If you catch it on sale and you can afford. Get one. You won't regret it.
1,Best streaming box on the market hands down. Bar none
1,"Highly recommend, fast reliable signal, great quality and convient"
1,Very easy and fun to use. I have it controlling all my lights in my home
1,This is a name brand tablet for less than the case of other tablets! This is a no brainer and will make great Christmas gifts!
1,Great streaming device with awesome games. Alexa works great
1,I visited a friend who had one and I was sold immediately. I love how all your streaming needs are in one little box. Plus it works with Alexa. I intend to get Alexa real soon..
1,Really inexpensive and does everything I need it to for my boys!
1,Bought for my granddaughter as a Christmas present and she loves it.
1,"I would recommend this to all of our friends and family. It's worth every penny. Good warranty, comes with a free subscription, works quickly and is very durable!"
1,"I read mixed reviews on these tablets and nearly talked myself out of buying one, but then on Black Friday the price hit 35 bucks temporarily, so I bought it.I am really happy that I did.While it's no where near that of the Apple devices in overall image quality, it puts out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of color and brightness.I was able to download all the main social media apps, several streaming content apps, and plenty of games to mess around with all for free. So far only 1 app has ""crashed"" on me resulting in a restart.The size is perfect, almost fits in a man's jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.Battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.I added a 64GB SD card to store things later, but I never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.The camera works well.The sound is decent.They make cases just like that of the Apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.Bottom line, it's not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who's never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. I would trust a device from Amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.We bought 4 more to give away at Christmas we liked ours so much."
1,Has endless possibilities with other smart home integrations. Lots of apps make it even more useful.
1,This is the best entry level tablet for kids. Cheap and with the Amazon free option you can give your kids what they like on your own terms. Also consider getting a protective case with it
1,"Fairly easy to set up and easy to operate. Some inconsistency with wi fi connections, but overall a solid buy."
1,Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.
1,"I've had this tablet for a week now and I love it. Im not the most gadgetly inclined person but I do know what I wanted/needed from a tablet and I must say my expectations have been met & exceeded. When the price drops again to what I paid for it, im definitely buying another. Christmas shopping never starts too early!!"
1,Pleased with Alexa. Finding information easily accessible and fun to gather. Would highly recommend.
1,I bought one for my son for his birthday. Loved it so much I bought a second one for my self.
1,"The new tablet is great ÔºÅ nice upgradesÔºÅLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
1,"I have the Ecobee Smart Thermostat and Sensors. Now, with the Echo and a few Dots throughout the house...I am looking more like George Jetson!!! A great device to voice control compatible smart devices!"
1,"I bought this device because my Fire HDX wasn't adequate for reading in direct sunlight. For sunlight reading, I give the Paperwhite a 5. However... I cannot change the display time before the screen sleeps, the reading location jumps backward and forward a lot when I touch the screen (when I thought I was just going one page either way), the home screen is confusing and not user friendly (only 3 books visible on ""show specials"" model) and the battery only lasts one day if I read 5 or 6 hours. For those reasons, I give it a 3 for both design options and user friendliness. That's a 3.6. Averaged up and gave it 4 stars."
1,"This was a great gift for my niece. She's 7, and she loves it. A lot of games, videos, movies, books... The tablet fits everywhere, and the price is great!"
1,Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
1,"The Amazon Fire pad is a great deal for the price. It works great very responsive, does exactly what I want it to do like Netflix, Google and a few games. It doesn't suck :)"
1,Got the fire stick and the fire tv. I like that I can plug the tv straight to the router with Ethernet cable. Seems to load pages faster and streams better with sling tv. Both are great items.
1,I bought this item for my 85 year old grandmother. She likes to play solitaire and read. She is always telling me that she plays solitaire to keep her mind sharp. I gave it to her as a christmas present and she loves it. I have since downloaded a couple of easy games for her. We haven't made it to the books or anything else yet. She is getting used to doing one thing at a time. She absolutely loves it and always has it with her. So much that I have to tell her to charge it. I am thinking of buying one for my self also.
1,Definitely Worth the $50 would recommend to friends
1,"Excellent sounds, microphone can pick up my voice from across the room."
1,Great product! It is SO much easier to read when it's sunny outside!
1,Was a great Black Friday find I enjoy playing on it . It's easy to use
0,I do not like the layout. I want to remove stuff from the screen and can't . I don't like some of the lock out features like playing songs for the kids. i do not like all the advertisements. I don't like the screen doesn't go dark when i want it to such as when music is playing. I liked the samsung
1,Alexa does well with basic applications. Hopefully Amazon will continue to improve on it's ability to answer more in depth questions besides the weather and play music.
1,I would recommend buying this. Worth the money for all you get.
1,"This system works great, even my five year old son can navigate channels with the remote or voice control. Has parental controls for purchases and viewing. Subscription required for some viewing."
1,I am satisfied of this kindle upgrade mainly in resolution.
1,"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games."
1,I purchased this for my mom for Easter - her eye sight isn't as good as it use to be but she loved to play games on her phone. So this is bigger for her to play her games and for 80 years young she is doing great with it.
0,"I've been using a Kindle forever, and when it became apparent I needed an Android device (I have a Windows phone, which I love but has serious app limitations) I thought I with a Fire I could get a tablet and upgrade my Kindle at the same time. But even with Geek Squad help I could never figure out how to upload the apps I needed onto the Fire. So back it went, replaced with a Lenovo tablet that does the trick."
0,I use this tablet for my daughter and I could only download YouTube Kids. Wished I would have purchased the one with more storage.
1,Just what I needed. Works great inside or outside. Must have a cover to protect the screen.
1,I love the new fire tv it works great with all my subscriptions
1,My only concern is that after only having the kindle open and useable is that it tends to freeze up. Otherwise this it is a great tablet to have!
1,"Great. I'm cheating on Siri with Alexa, She gets me!!! Well done AI, seemless intergration with other smart products. Just a joy to have around. Microphone picks up commands from a distance. Very well done. I bought 2 Echo Dots for other rooms."
1,"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it."
1,"Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming."
1,"I found the Fire TV to be a great buy!! I love it and take it everywhere I can. Note that Prime TV does not work in some countries overseas, Netflix does so we still find a lot of things to watch when on the road. You can rent movies on Amazon (paid) but no Prime unfortunately. Other than that and if you are in the US, no problems and highly recommended!"
1,Fast to install and I very easy to work it's got great resolution
1,LIMITED CAPACITY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS A VERY GOOD BUY
1,My daughter loves it and you can't beat the warranty!
1,Bought this for my toddler and teen they both love it.
1,I use this for setting alarms and reminders and for activating my lifX lights. The set up is super easy and sound quality and volume levels are really good too
1,"Cord cutter here. We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner. Since we use Prime and Amazon Music, its a no-brainer for us to use the Fire TV. Everything syncs automatically and transfers from device to device seamlessly.Edited to add the following section after reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews:If you are a first-time cord-cutter, considering cord-cutting or new to streaming TV services, here are a few things to keep in mind.1) Make sure you really take the time to do research and due-diligence on cord-cutting. Just google ""cord cutting"" to get started with several good articles. I'm seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like Netflix, Hulu, etc. Fire TV (and all of the other streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, etc.) do not just give you free access to all content. They allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch. If you do it right, you'll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable.2) Make sure you have a strong (and fast) internet connection. This is very important. We dumped our cable company in its entirety (including internet service) and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company. We have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming Fire TV. So make sure yours can as well. If you're not sure, call your internet service provider, tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds.3) Some apps require a cable subscription. You can purchase a streaming service like Sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps. For now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but I suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed. So do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want.4) Give yourself time to adjust to the new interface. It took some getting used to when I lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide. But the fact is, I'm no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide. Rather than surf, I'm turning to specific apps to watch specific programs. Its liberating in a way that I didn't expect. Besides, I can now surf all of the Amazon Prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote."
1,This fire tablet has handled all of the facebook games I play without skipping or tieing up.I'm very impressed.
1,It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.
1,This tablet was brought for my 6 year old an is great for just about everything an I love that I can put controls on it . An it was cheap
1,Easy to navigate. There's not anything new we don't like about it.
1,New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
1,"If you are planning on buying a amazon fire stick, reconsider and buy the fire tv. Far superior, better display and faster processor."
1,Love shopping at Best Buys. Better deals than Walmart.
1,Bought this for my five year old and she loves it.
1,My daughter loves it! She reads and play her favorite games on it everyday.
1,"This works much better than the fire stick. There is no buffering at all with movies and tv. Ended up buy 2 more,."
1,Does everything I expected it to do. Definitely a great product for folks who want a good product with an affordable price.
0,Need to explain all required' hookups' to less non technical elderly people for sure.
1,"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train."
0,"I don't like it, I would not recommend this to anyone"
1,"Way better than my older Roku! Unit doesn't freeze like my older Roku, very very satisfied!!"
1,I love the Amazon Echo. Easy to use with great speakers.
1,This Kindle is great and easy for me to Read books that I wanted to do a long time
1,"The Fire TV from Amazon works great! I have cancelled cable TV and am watching movies, news, football and etc. via Sling and the Fire TV. Takes some getting used to, but I would highly recommend if you want to save money on your cable bill and still enjoy TV."
1,"The controller and box are compact. The use of device is straight forward, but still requires a few days to become intuitive. There is a problem removing the battery cover, that allows replacement of batteries. It was immovable, and I finally had to use a pocket knife to pry it open, scaring the bottom of the controller. Amazon should have spotted the problem before going into production, accounting for the 4 star rating."
1,I have bought four of these now. Great gifts and great for kids.
1,Love it! It's an awesome item and my mom loves it! She wanted this and is not computer savvy so she is more familiar with it since my daughter had one
1,I bought this tablet for my almost 3yr old. We didn't want to splurge on an iPad and this was a great price. We love to read books on it and watch movies in the car!
1,I havent played it at all but my son enjoys playing with his. Thats what it was meant for so I cant complain.
1,Tablet met all her needs! She loves it! Great purchase
1,Great gift and excellent product for anyone. Easy to use and user friendly.
1,battery life is good. clarity and color are good. still learning how to navigate.
1,Love this product it does just want I purchased it for.
1,Great product and service. the amazon kindle was is perfect for reading
1,Got this mainly to watch Sony vue tv. Just got sick. And tired of cable and satellite prices going up and up. Lots of other neat stuff you can do with this also. Prime. Is also great source
1,Like the tablet wish it had better battery life the older kindle battery life was amazing
1,Great tablet for beginners to use. Easy operating system
1,Got it to gift to my friend. Absolutely loved it. Good value.
1,Best e-reader ever! love the back light and how light it is. My boss suggested the paperwhite after she saw how much I love to read and I have to say it's the best gift I could've ever bought myself. If you love to read you won't be disappointed because it reads like an actual book the only difference is it's not bulky and you can actually adjust the backlight as needed. I also love the fact that I can read at night without having to turn on the lamp to see the letters. You can also adjust the font size so you don't have to strain your eyes (try doing that on a regular book). Over all I can't say enough good things about the paperwhite. I totally LOVE mine!!
1,"Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already!"
1,Quick with fun facts. Great for playing various genres of music rather than searching for radio stations.
1,CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY GRAND KIDS AND NO COMPLANTES AS OF YET.
1,"A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT!"
1,love the item. many features and variety of options. recent and old programs and movies. i can now look at a whole series at once.
1,"Works great after I learned how to maneuver through the numerous software components. Once I became familiar with using the Amazon Black box, I can now donate my old movies to numerous charities (tax time)."
1,My daughter hasn't put it down since Christmas. We're both in love! It's very easy for her to operate (she's 2) and very easy to set up. It's a win win for both parent and child.
1,"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist....."
1,"I love how echo responds so quickly. Her speaker are remarkable and clear sounding, no static ."
1,I got this for my kids and it is perfect. I got each of them one and now all 4 of them have linked up their games and build cities together.
0,This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.
1,"The price is AMAZING for the product! Works as well as any tablet, and is the perfect size for your hand bag. Plus, if you are Amazon Prime member - you can download movies to watch. Awesome!"
1,"I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader."
1,Perfect gift for your kid .. will enjoy playing and learning with it
1,This is a great kindle and my son loves it! It took a little effort to set it up but that's it.
1,"If you want a tablet to perform basic functions, you can't do any better than the Kindle Fire 7. Check email, social media, surf the web, download and read ebooks with no problems. Good battery life."
1,Purchased it mostly to listen to music but it does so much more than I expected.
1,Very easy to set up and connect to the wireless network.
1,"Runs great, no complaints. Nice size screen, nice specs all around. Cant do any better for 50 bucks"
0,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.
1,"My daughter uses this and loves it. The only complaint she had was she cannot get games from the google store because it will only allow game and app downloads from the Amazon store and Amazon does not have all the games. But as far as working, it does what it is supposed to."
1,Good that it has parental control. Good for a simple tablet.
1,It is simple and easy to use. Easy set up. I have a Firestick and Fire TV and this has a nicer interface.
1,This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
1,It's not bad especially considering the price.i would recommend
1,The beginning of the end for paid cable!!! Got the Kodi jail break and can get any series on tv new episodes the very next day!!! Just awesome!
1,"After purchasing for myself and mother in the past, I felt it was reliable and friendly enough for my 11 year old. Easy to set up and has parental controls. She loves to use it for reading and games. It's fabulous and the price was excellent and my main deciding factor. You just can't beat $49.99. Thanks Best Buy."
1,Apps are easy to find . I would recommend this product to a friend
1,I'm more impressed with this that I has anticipated! Alexa has been very helpful around the house from music to cooking timer and 20 question with my kid! Now we are stocking up on the smart home items that work with it!
1,"To me, this is an AMAZING little device. I suppose it's not very fast by modern standards. Downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliable--my home internet connection is not the greatest. But the screen. for its size, is beautiful. There are many games, apps, and books available for free. I LOVE my Kindle Fire. It has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and Facebook. The graphic on games amaze me. If you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money, I think this is a great choice. I'm considering getting one for my sister."
1,I purchased one a few weeks before purchasing this one. SD Card slot cover broke when trying to insert card. Decided to get another one. This one is fine. Have to use tape to hold other one in.
1,I own both a Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick. The Amazon Fire TV is by far superior than the Fire Stick. The Fire TV is perfect for all-in-one entertainment and perfect if you're looking to get rid of cable/satellite tv. Also very ideal for Kodi
1,"Alexis doesn't always respond, could not connect to WIFI when I took it to Vegas"
0,Easy set up but did not meet my needs of being able to access Spectrum app. .
1,We have several tablets and iPads in the house and this is one of my favorites
1,"The tablet is not top of the line, but for using it for games, reading, watching movies, it works great. A lot of inexpensive tablets are junk but Amazon has put out a reliable product. I would recommend also getting a micro sd card."
1,"This ""toy""does so many things. It gives the weather,plays music and also tunes in to my favorite radio stations. There is not enough room in this space to tell you all it does. Enjoy!"
1,"best e reader to date. yes it's a bit pricey, but it reads like a real book."
1,Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
1,"I purchased Chromecasts the year they came out and while they served their purpose for two years they are just not very upgradable. I recently bought the Fire Stick and Fire TV Box made by Amazon. I am also a Netflix and Amazon Prime member. Both of these devices are FAR Superior to the options provided by the older Chromecasts AND even the new 4K models. Easy to use and upgradable with many apps and games, and if you have Amazon Prime it is a no-brainer purchase."
1,"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader."
1,Best product for reading.I am using since one and half years.
1,Great if you like reading at night. Backlight works great.
0,"Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."
1,You can't go wrong with this Kindle! It's a super price and a great Kindle! It's great for reading or surfing the net!
1,It was the easiest tablet to use. I bought about 5 of them and it was good for traveling.
1,"I purchased two of these tablets for my children (6,3). The ease of use is fantastic and the parental controls are exactly what I was looking for. Great product."
1,"Definitely, one of the best connected home devices ! Very practical and accessible! I have one in each room !"
1,Great tool to have around the house! Like a personal assistant at your finger tips!
1,Great entertainment value for my 5 yr old! Just wish it had more internal memory
1,It works. Not much else to say.
1,"I'm really enjoying my kindle fire 7 in tablet!Love,love,love my kindle! Operating system handles smoothly and screen graphics are Amazing!!I am definitely happy with my decision to buy this product and I would recommend it to everyone!"
0,Its ok for the price if willing to deal with the ads and cant download certain apps.
1,The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition is a great device for kids and parents to entertain kids during long or short trips
1,Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!
1,Fantastic product at An affordable price and fast delivery
1,daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it.
0,Amazon Prime was required in order for us to use the Echo the way we wanted
1,Connected great and works awesome. Right out of the box it connected.
1,My 7 yr old loves it. Easy for him to navigate and understand.
1,"Great addition for a tv without smart features, and great for games for kids."
1,THERE IS SO MUCH THIS THING CAN DO....I HAVENT EVEN SCRATCHED THE SURFACE.....I TRULY ENJOY THE ABILITY TO SEARCH FOR MUSIC WHILE I COOK....JUST HEAVENLY......SHES GREAT!
1,Amazon is the tip of leading technology. Always have had great luck with their product.
1,"I was quite surprised by the ease with of setting this up. The voice control with Alexa works great, far exceeded my expectations. Great picture quality and a good selection of shows and movies."
0,"It seems that the majority of questions I have, Alexa does not have a clue."
1,"The Amazon Fire met all my expectations. I would highly recommend this unit over the Roku 3. It is easy to install. Of course, Amazon has terrific online / phone support. The Fire has a competitive price point. The Remote is much more intuitive and easy to use versus the Roku 3. There are many more apps and ""How-to's"" on YouTube. My unit is more versatile than the Roku 3. Plus the Amazon ""behemoth"" is committed to making the Fire the best video/music streamer at a reasonable cost with many app options. Amazon is not going away soon! However, be careful, this unit can be very additive."
1,this is my first tablet/iphone. It was confusing to learn how to navigate. after a few days of fustrution and watch/reading help sections I figured it out. there are alot of feature and apps I have yet to explore. I use it mainly to read and watch movies at work. I like it very much.
1,Love the Fire TV!!! Can tell the difference in load time and changing menus. Would recommend this to criends and family.
1,"Lost my ""paper white"" in airplane, have to buy new one. Voyage is latest model, I like it. Friend of mine wants one as well with my recommendation, so, bought two. Nice to have them!"
1,"The amazon echo is a combination fun, entertaining and helpful electronic product. Best Buy offered the echo at a great price and reasonable shipping rates. My next buy will be the mini version from the same store."
1,Great price for a tablet.Bought this for my father
1,I wrote the review previously thinking it was the Amazon fire. Turned out it was the case I reviewed. The Amazon Fire is a great alternative to the kindle and the case is sleek and not bulky.
1,Purchase was good. Very easy to set up and use. Clear screen. Easy to charge. Would like more storage.
1,Basic tablet that we got for our toddler. Offers enough apps to keep her entertained and a low price point. If she breaks this I will not be too upset compared to other tablets.
1,I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.
1,Best present to me!!!. It goes everywhere that I go
1,I just cancelled cable it's very easy to set up and tons of options to watch. Ask Alexia anything you want any she has an answer.
1,"This tablet is exacting what it is, an inexpensive, decent tablet. I got it for grandchildren to use for game apps and books from Amazon."
1,"I bought 2 of these, played with one of them, then gave then as gifts to people for Christmas."
1,Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself
1,Works good just miss google play store. Nose resolution and speed
1,So easy to move from room to room. We also take it on trips with us. Plug into any HDMI use the hotel internet and boom. All set.
1,"Love the backlight, great feature. Very light weight almost too much so."
1,I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
1,"Overall this is a great tablet for the money. It does exactly what you need it to do. If you looking for a tablet to search the web, or just do basic things this is the tablet that you should get."
1,"If you want a good tablet and don't want to spend a lot of money, I recommend this. Well made and reliable. I have one for myself and bought one as a gift."
1,I got very good customer service explaining the difference in tablets and Kindle Fire is what was suggested to me as all I want to do is use it as a ereader.
1,The amazon fire provides an excellent budget tablet.
1,"The device itself is funtional and gives you access to many types of services ex: netflix, hulu, amazon prime, and much more. It also allows you to customize it by side loading programs. Its not a bad little device but I prefer its big brother the amazon fire tv."
1,"I've had the original Kindle and was excited to get the paper white for Christmas. I absolutely love it. Extremely easy to read and handle. Wish I had gotten it a long time ago,"
1,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.
1,"A great tablet for our two youngest kids, at a great price!"
1,"What an amazing design and product. After reading many reviews and seeing the full potential of this product, we just had to have it. We are completely pleased with all the functions and capabilities."
1,Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit.
1,"I like this because it plays all prime music on Amazon and all you have to do is tell Alexa what you would like to hear and it will play it for you. We use it by our pool all the time and the kids have instant music. I use it daily for the weather, and I always know how to dress for the day. I am constantly learning more and more from Alexa."
1,"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
1,"The Echo is awesome and fun. We use it to control TV,s Thermostats, Lights, and Stereo all with voice commands. Anyone using amazon prime will like the voice ordering. We find something new everyday that the echo will do."
1,Amarion tablet the speakers are really good but could be at the front
1,"Alexa was the perfect gift for a recently widowed relative. She loves that she can have music playing, or ask about the weather conditions, or the current news. A fabulous gift and almost like a new roommate!"
1,the kindle is awesome it holds so many books. I can check out books from the library while sitting on my couch. I take it with me everywhere when ever there is time I read.
1,Great for using at home as an alarm and finding things
1,"needed this for a 5 year old to play games and watch movies, and it is a great fit for the $$$"
1,I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one
1,"Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week."
1,"Alexa helps us with shopping, answering questions and finding new music."
1,The Amazon Fire is really easy to navigate and use. I really like it!
1,This is a great media box! Streaming is smooth and the remote is simple and easy to use.
1,"This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine."
1,"Great piece of technology. Very easy to set up and use. So, easy to have her play your favorite music, get weather, news updates, etc."
1,Christmas present for a friend. They absolutely love it!
0,"We've tried several of these little streamer boxes - Fire TV, Roku3, Apple TV (not the newest one). I think the Roku is my favorite. This one is competent, if you have Amazon Prime you'll miss it on the Apple TV. But the voice command mode - the one distinguishing feature of the Fire - is not useful. It only searches Amazon content and while Amazon has a lot of stuff we watch more on Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Hulu, etc. So, not so useful. I would get the Roku. The remote with headphones is a great feature."
1,"I purchased the firestick first and had it for awhile and really enjoyed it until i decided to spend the extra money to get the box for my second one and i could not believe the speed difference in the two, the box is awesome i love it!!!"
1,"Overall we enjoy our new Echo tower. The speaker is not the same quality as our Sonos or Bose speakers but the convenience of being able to ask Alexa to play a song or find a style of music or tell you the weather or traffic as you are running out the door make up for the quality. The kids love asking her to rap or tell a joke. I look forward to syncing Alexa to more of our IoT items to make controls ""hands free""."
1,"If you like reading, this is the thing to get, so much better than tablet for reading."
1,I have both fire tv and the fire stick. The fire tv is way faster than the stick.
1,I bought this tablet for my 8 year old....when going on long cars rides it's nice to keep them entertained. It was a great value.
1,"Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.My only concern has been for the space available. I was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 GB of space on apps."
1,"totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis!"
1,"God tablet for young kids. Not as fast as an iPad, but it does the job."
1,Easy to setup. Up and running in no time.Very helpful to have.
1,"I am an avid Apple fan but Alexa has Siri beat! She's easy to talk to, she always listens and does what I tell her to! Lol"
1,"We purchased this tablet for my 9 year old daughter as a extra Christmas present. She loved it from the start, great starter tablet for reading and games. No lag on gaming, just enough space and perfect for using around the house. Highly recommended for first time tablet or starter. Especially for the price."
1,the clarity is amazing on this reader and the adjustable lighting tops it all off nicely
1,Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.
1,This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.
1,"Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable."
1,Bought this as a gift. Does everything the recipient needed. All features listed were adequate.
1,Looked at the Echo before we bought this and I would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable. This has everything we need and then some.
1,"I use this speaker to play Pandora stations, to give weather and news updates. Wish I could access my calendar on iCloud."
1,"I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue. They was for my 5 and 7 years children. They really love their tablets. Yes, it was a birthday gift."
1,My mom really likes this tablet. It has a much bigger screen for her to stream her news shows. She is very happy with her first tablet.
1,I had my first Echo for about a year before taking it out the box. I set it up in my bedroom and it is a nice additional to all the other electronics I have. I purchase a second Echo for my living room area as an entertainment device to play games.
1,Must have if you have Amazon Prime. Easy to set up and easy to use.
1,"Great Price on a nice little tablet , easy to use !!"
1,"This was recommended by a friend to give children something to do on trips, so I bought them for my grandchildren. They used it and were occupied and quiet all the way to DisneyWorld."
1,very good entry level table for the money. it works very well.
1,This is nice tablet with great functions. Great for reading books. Fairly easy to use on the web. Lots of Apps available.
1,For the price I paid not having HD on the kindle was no matter. Has lots of storage and the kids are using it at school for their class assignments. Screen is big enough to read off of and everything is loading fairly fast. Kindle looks to be durable.
1,Great item and love shopping at Best Buy. I buy all my electronic there for everyone in my house.
1,Alexia is a very smart AI source. She response quickly and offers an extensive library of knowledge and music. The Echo fills a small room with sound.
1,I own 3 firesticks for every tv in the house never had a problem with any of them . Wanted upgrade and saw some reviews online and I'm glad I got my hands on the firetv. With a faster processor expandable memory is just perfect for kodi the next. Big thing next to the nvidia shield which I own as well. I will definitely recommend it .
1,Great sales support. Called store beforehand and held product for pick up the same day.
1,"I love this kindle. I've never had one before but I would definitely recommend one to those that are avid or casual readers. No glare, easy to use, easy to bring anywhere."
1,"I really enjoy my new kindle. I can read in the dark, I can have all my books without taking up space, and the battery lasts a long time."
1,I absolutely love my Echo! There's not a day that goes by it isn't being used. Would highly recommend to anyone with a hectic schedule like myself.
1,This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you.
1,"Besides surfing online, making airfare , hotels, and rental cars reservation's, I am using banking online and able to make payments all my bills to a differents kind of business."
1,The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.
1,I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
1,Good product much faster response then a fire stick
1,Cheap but ok processor. $50 is an excellent deal. Response from touchscreen not great as iPad but price reflected.
1,"I bought this case for my son, fits perfectly! Easy to put on, love it!"
1,As long as apps are downloaded before leaving WIFI they work great for road trips or hunting trips!
1,Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
1,Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one. Light and the battery last much longer.
1,I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3.
1,"Not only is it an excellent first tablet for a child, but it is a kindle. They can grow into it as well. And from studying up on the product before hand, I was able to determine that they have excellent customer service! That is a big plus!"
1,The best in the market as far as e-reader goes. The text is sharp with the new screen. The backlight are useful for reading at night without lights on. Integration with the Kindle store makes it very easy to instantly purchase and read the book.I have one small build quailty issue with the unit that I have. The left side of the Kindle creaks when I squeeze on it. Exchanged for a new unit but problem still persists (although not as bad).
1,"This tablet is perfect for the kids. Easy to use, dependable, and affordable."
1,Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
1,I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!
1,this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
1,love that i can request any music i want to hear!!
1,Amazon fire is cheap and best for reading and playing games. I bought this to gift someone and it was liked very much
1,This makes a great light weight tablet for kids. Durable and very good for setting up restrictions and time limits for kids too
1,"Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
1,"This product is wonderful! We use it for shopping lists, music, and general info! We sit around the dinner table wondering about something and we just ask her! Its also great for timers and measuring! LOVE IT!"
1,Gave as a gift. Hope it is working as planned. Nice sale price.
0,"Great tablet for kids, however DO NOT charge this tablet in your car! The charger in your car will ruin your tablet! The Fire 7 tablet charger can only handle so much current and your car charger has too much current! We could not power on the tablet after trying to charge our tablets using the car charger. It happened to both of our tablets and we had the tablets less than 1 month. Best Buy was nice enough to replace one tablet and give us a refund for the other (I paid more money for a nicer tablet)."
1,"Far exceeded my expectations. Very simple setup. Having Amazon Prime makes this purchase a ""no brainer"""
0,cheap - need to constantly make sure plugged in - slightly too small - saved some bucks there - not amazon quality
1,This was on sale for an awesome price that I could not pass up. I already have a black one definitely a must buy.
1,"Its a good tablet, I use it for e-textbooks, very comfortable."
1,It works fine.
1,This is a good tablet for the kids. They love watching youtube and playing apps.
1,"We love the Echo! We are having fun learning all of the possibilities of options it can do! We have even traveled with it, and it works fine!Great speakers! Excellent sound!"
1,This is a fantastic product. Picture quality is awesome. Increased our internet speed so hardly an buffering. Much faster than the stick.
1,"It's a decent tablet for the price, especially if you have Amazon Prime. The ads are really annoying though and you have to pay to turn them off or pay extra for a tablet that comes without ads."
1,I got the Fire TV so that I can watch Directv Now. It works really well and is right up there with the Roku Premiere + that I also own.
1,Great first computer for kids. Durable and easy to manipulate. Lots of fun and educational games for the kids.
1,First I wanna say that the Amazon Fire Series is the best in media streaming devices out now. I purchased this do to the fact that i had a best buy rewards coupon since i racked up a lot of points from previous purchases. I was curious to see if this worked just like the fire stick. I am here to say it does and better. I wanted to try out my ethernet connection (RJ45) cable and see if it would lag or buffer. So far it has not. You can install kodi tv on this just like the fire stick. I just installed kodi version 17.1 and i must say it works faster and the movies are more clearer as well. I run it through my home audio receiver with an hdmi passthough which is more efficient for most of the smart tvs on the market today. The audio is way better i had to go to the settings on kodi and change from a 2.0 channel to 5.1 channel. It also has a sd card slot & usb drive as well don't know if i will ever need that.If you are an amazon prime member is also a good advantage as well because you can also stream any amazon prime video for free. Good job Amazon!!
1,I love this thing runs my lights .The shoping list and to do list is very handy
0,"This is a fully functional tablet for under $1000. Yes it is slow, yes it works. For my child it is fine. If you are looking for something to be fast, slick, improve your productivity - you will need to spend more money."
1,Nice display--good colors and fairly easy to read. Good for reading. Ok for email. Sort of clunky for other apps. File management is difficult.
1,I wish it could stream music from my private NAS and not only from purchased online music sources. Need to buy hubs and other interfaces for it to control lights and heating
1,This a great product for the price. The amazon benefits alone would have made the an excellent deal... But this is a great low-end tablet as well.
1,"8 year old granddaughter loves hers, and I do too!"
1,It's smaller than I one I had and it holds battery life good
1,For two girls that love to play games and take with them
1,It's the one I was expected. Everything went great this time. Thank you best buy.
1,Got it for only $39! What a great price for a great little tablet!
1,"Great tablet, only thing I would add would be a camera. My daughter loves it!"
1,Apple exceeds in all areas minus 4K. Tough decision but if I had to choose again I would opt for the new Apple TV.
1,Bought one for my great nephew and one for my grandson both 7 years old and it's perfect. Price and what they can do.
1,Great product if you are already a heavy Amazon user. Bought one for my parents and they love how they can stream free movies from Prime.
0,"I thought it would do more, eg. be able to integrate with my cell phone to make calls or send text messages"
0,"My old Kindle stopped charging, after 4 years, so I got the Fire to replace it. I really only needed a reader and that is how I use it. The battery runs down MUCH faster than my old Kindle. the price was right so I guess it will work fine."
1,My granddaughter loves it! Long battery and is tough.She loves all the games and she learning so muchEveryday.
1,"I've been using kindles for many years and have tried every model out there. For my purposes, the Paperwhite is the best. I have a very wide range of interests in my reading and the ease that the Paperwhite offers in creating folders to make accessing books is truly remarkable. It is so easy to switch from alphabetizing by author, date of purchase, or title of book. My eyes give me trouble on some days so I really like how easy it is to change font size and background lighting, Since purchasing the Paperwhite, I have delegated my Fire almost exclusively to the role of playing games. Almost all of my reading is done on the Paperwhite. (this purchase was actually a second Paperwhite that I use as a secondary kindle which I keep next to my bed for easy access for nighttime reading. Even though the Paperwhite is so light, having one in each of the places where I read the most is very convenient."
1,For the price it's perfect. Does all the basics well and if you break it you won't be heartbroken. Well worth it.
1,I bought this for my mother in law. I have a Kindle and I absolutely love it. Perfect if you only want a tablet for reading books.
1,Easy setup. I will buy the second one for my bed room
1,"Nice item. Only drawback, occasional pauses upon turning page or creating bookmark."
1,"Echo is a great , it can answer all questions and issues you may have . Great for homework."
1,This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
1,I simply love it. At first I thought reading black and white content on a iPad would be a similar experience and reading on iPad or iPhone is similar and no need for kindle. But kindle is different and for me it's better than reading a physical book. It's so cool to carry around thousands of books at any time. Battery goes on and on and on. Excellent piece of hardware.
1,The Kindle fire is a great product. Will do so many things. Would recommend to anyone.
1,I bought this for my wife who wanted it more for travel. Ideal for airplane travel and works well with cover on the beach as well. She even uses it a lot in the home.
1,"Since my Kindle Paperwhite died, this new Voyage has been a good replacement."
1,This is a fun device for listening to music and getting news updates. I thought it would have a bit more functionality but I think I need to explore apps that it works with and I am sure more will be coming but for the price point the speaker alone is worth it.
1,"I received my Echo as a gift. I use it often for keeping lists, acquiring weather information and whenever I I have a question. I gave this Echo as a gift and the recipient loves it as much as I do."
1,"Easy to use, love that I can download a free book each month since I am an Amazon prime member. Very light. Perfect way to read at the beach."
1,"Got 1each for mom and dad (seniors), alien to android were using that very day on their own.. they love it"
1,I cannot think of a better e-read than kindle. At first it seems a little bit dark and weird but after a while you will find that you cannot read on ipad or other pads anymore. Kindle is just that good
1,"Purchased these for my grandsons, ages 5 and 7, they absolutely love them. Able to download apps with ease."
1,My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right!
1,As a gift you can't go wrong. Best price an happy customer
1,this is a fun gadget that can make a lazy person even lazier. Love the features
1,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem."
1,"Bought this for my mother in law who is having trouble reading small print. Didn't want to spend as much as a kindle paperwhite, so this was a reasonable compromise to give her the option of adjusting the light and size of the font when she is reading."
1,One of the best products I've bought in the last couple of years.
1,Really like this product! Can't wait to get additional products that can be controlled by it!
1,"My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it."
1,"This thing is super fun to play with. Its amazing how microsoft, apple, or google didn't come out with something like this before Amazon of all companies did. Works incredibly well"
1,My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
1,"Its a value for money product ,serves the purpose and very well suite daily needs."
1,Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features
1,Its no ipad or samsaung but it works i dont have a problem with it. And the price was great on black Friday
1,"I love to read! Books,books, books and more books."
0,This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.
1,"This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly!"
1,"I bought this item as a gift, it is definitely worth what I paid for it, it is easy to navigate and has great picture quality, think I'll buy myself one"
1,we gave this as a gift to an older person to basically use as an e-reader. so far it has worked great.
1,I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
1,I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
1,"I bought this for my 9 year olds birthday. He loves it. Not too fancy, but gets the job done for him."
1,"I recently bought this on sale at Best Buy for $34 on Black Friday and couldn't be happier. While I wanted primarily an e-reader (which this does very well) I also use my new 5th generation Fire 8 for Facebook, CNBC, Fox, and CNN news updates, Alexa queries, and occasional email. I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful."
1,I got this tablet on a sale. I think it was $33. It is great for reading my books on or letting my kids play games.
1,I love this item...I got it for my grand daughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it also...this is her first tablet and it has all the features she'll love!!
1,"Plugged everything in, using a network cable instead of wifi, and everything just works. The box is responsive, would be nice if the remote had tv volume options, but that's a small nitpick. Very happy with the purchase, it confirmed my decision to be a cord cutter and drop DirecTV."
1,"My Mom has short term memory loss and I thought this may assist her. The most important ability that we need from the Echo is to easily put things into calendars,reminders, or timers and then easily retrieve them.I think there was an update for that ability. I haven't had much time to set it up yet. With what we have done with it,-Sounds good, plays music,gives directions, good dictionary.Will do more and update this review. I really hope that it can help my Mom! Thanks,Sidney Michelle"
1,Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
1,We live our new Alexa. The grandkids have fun asking her questions and she provides us with tons of info as well.
1,"If you are a hardcore reader, this is your Kindle! The light makes a huge difference to read under any conditions, it¬¥s a big improvement from the standard Kindle, if you are unsure between one or the other, go for the Paperwhite, it¬¥s worth the extra money."
1,Works great plus look at YouTube video's to see other features available.
1,"My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable."
1,This was a good investment. That being said do yourself a favor and buy a SD Micro card and add it on before you download anything. Makes it run that much smoother
1,"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
1,"Small and light weight, easy to read from in bright light conditions"
1,"This charger (9W) rapid charger is as described. It works well with both my Fire 7.0 8.9 HDXs. A bonus is the angled usb connector, which fits over the origami case making for a stable and secure connection. A good deal."
1,Gave the Kindle Paperwhite as a gift to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Great battery life.
1,"I have been on the fence for quite some time about getting a dedicated e-reader. Like many, I didn't want to spend money and yet another device. However, review after review always mentions that where the value in the Kindle is in the distraction-free reading experience and having finally purchased one, I wholeheartedly agree with this as well. The Kindle Paperwhite is light weight and is easy to carry around. This is my first Kindle since the 2nd gen, and I'm impressed by the speed and screen quality. The lighting on the Paperwhite is a huge benefit and is not at all distracting while reading."
1,it is Alexa app for smartphone; Alexa Voice Service; 360 degrees omni-directional audio
1,I love my new Fire HD and it takes great photos! It has a nice size screen but is compact enough to fit in my purse.
1,"Got this on Black Friday and wasn't I would use it much but I do, excellent value, easy to use."
1,This is a great purchase for the price. I use it all the time to read on the go. It is like having a library in my purse
1,Got it for my daughter to read books. She loves it!
1,Has all the major streaming channels and is lightning fast. Highly recommended.
1,"Love it ,great product for a great price. Will be getting another one"
1,"My Amazon Kindle Paperwhite B00OQVZDJM, which features a 6 300 ppi Carta ePaper antiglare touch screen with optimized fonts. The built-in backlight makes it simple to read at night."
1,A great place to start in tablet market good value
1,Got this tablet for my kids and couldn't beat the price for a tablet reader. Kids watch movies and play games on this
1,Great for the price and easy to install and use. Learn new stuff everyday
1,I love the fact I can tell it to play a song or turn the lights on and not have to get up!
1,Love the tablet. Great reviews for the amazon kindle
1,"Easy setup. Compact. For reading, I still prefer my basic Kindle Reader, but the apps are nice to have when I want to do some extra things on the Fire."
1,The Fire Tablet has an amazing screen great price SIM card slot
1,"Decided to try the Amazon Fire to replace our cable TV. Since I'm already an Amazon Prime member for other reasons, this was only a one-time expense for me. It was a very good choice - the Amazon Fire has given me the flexibility to watch what I want to watch and when without having to record and monitor what I record on the DVR. With the Amazon Fire I'm in control and not the cable company Even with adding Hulu & Sling, I'm still saving $100 each month!"
1,"I had a fire tv stick and it works great, so wanted to try the fire tv box. Works great and loads much faster."
1,"This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
1,Alexa is an amazing device. Does more than we thought could do. could not be happier.
1,"The tablet was a gift for my Dad for Christmas. He likes it so far, the music part he loves. The tablet is build solid. I like the home page better than my 6 inches one. He has used expansion micro SD by putting 128gb."
1,Really cool looking in person. Purchased this and 3 other Echo Dots to work together. It definitely can hear you from a distance. It operates my LIFX lights but doesn't change the colors if I ask it to. It doesn't work well with Pandora to pick stations so not sure how to get it to do that. It only remembers the last station that I was playing. Lots of home automation integration. Being able to set my alarm just by talking is better than a clock next to the bed. Overall lots of great features. Takes time to learn what it can do overall. This one is the Best if you want a louder speaker than the Echo Dot and it actually looks cool too.
1,I bought this tablet for my sister she loves reading books she can downloaded as many as wants
1,"Very capable wireless bluetooth speaker, but the real genius is the awe inspiring voice recognition. It blows away Siri and other voice assistants. There is something really magical about using your voice as a computer interface. Constant over the air updates mean that this device gains new functionality every week."
1,"The fire tv box is great, houses tons of apps and games. I like it so much I have a box on all four tv'shows in my house."
1,"I bought this item for my husband for Christmas. We were wondering if he would really like it as he usually just likes to read actual books, but he immediately loved it. It's very user friendly and he has enjoyed getting to know all the ins and outs of it. It is a great way to read a book, but it has so many other uses too. I'm very glad I purchased this item. It's proven to be an excellent purchase."
1,"It was a Christmas Gift for Mom and Dad. They both love them and use them all the time. Its processor is pretty accurate, but not too slow. I would recommend as a gift."
1,"Excellent tablet for 50, works very well, surprise me when found it have bluethoot to connect with my sound dock."
1,Very good microphone. Wife gets annoyed with kids having fun with it.
1,This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
0,"I like the kindle fire for all the free games you can get on it. I wanted it for a long time and during the holiday season, I found it on sale and I bought it!"
1,"Best price cant complaint, super fast really responsive and if you have an amazon prime account the best."
1,Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
0,"Decided to spend the extra money to get the model with more processing power for games. Other than the occasional heating up and the unit freezing, it serves its purpose"
1,I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
1,Keep finding more this to do with it - music is great and I like the shopping list.
1,Works like a charm. I really enjoy how I can ask anything and it will respond.
1,"I got this on black Friday for my mother and so far she enjoys it. It was to replace her iPad mini 1 that they have basically designed to become in operable within 2 years. She can add storage to the Kindle, the picture is fire, and she can read a plethora of books that suit her fancy. It's nice size and responsive."
1,A great product for my kids and great learning apps at the app store
1,We now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share. I would have no problem recommending this to a friend.
1,i very like this item because is easy to use and fast conect
1,Good sound quality. Charging dock is an added advantage.
1,These are the best you can get! I have bought 2 already
1,Bought this for my adult son who is confined to a bed due to MS. His caregivers can ask Alexa to play Pearl Jam music and its there. This is the second one we have plus we also have the Dot.
1,Great screen and very light to hold. It makes reading a book effortless.
1,I bought it for my daughter best thing ever I will recommend it to anyone
1,Bought this as a gift for grandson who loves to read. Easy to set up and easy to use. Love it.
1,This is the most convenient of all the models I have used
1,This item was bought as a gift and it did not disappoint the person whom I bought it for.
1,"I bought this product based on reviews, and it fits the description as a near-perfect, reasonably-priced, all-purpose Kindle reader. The screen's front-lit display allows me to read under all lighting conditions, from bright sunlight to dark, without eyestrain.I bought the Paperwhite as a supplemental reader for my Samsung tablet so that I could read outside. After several months of use, I'm finding that I do all my reading on the Paperwhite.I read several hours a day and the battery lasts four or five days under that usage, which is a great change from my tablet, which needed a recharge daily, usually at an inconvenient time.I recommend buying the companion leather case because the case puts the Paperwhite to sleep with the cover is closed, extending battery life."
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is easy to read in daylight outside is shining as well as in the dark. I no longer need a reading light at night to enjoy my books. The battery lasts several weeks between charges. I would recommend this unit to friends!
1,I highly recommend this product for children with special needs
0,I have one issue with this tablet. What headphones work with this tablet? I used a pair the first time to watch a movie and they worked fine. When trying to view a movie again none of the headphones are working on this tablet. I have tried multiple headsets with no success. Please Help!
1,Son-in-law asked for this as a Christmas gift. Wanted something to take along on business trips for easy access to books and/or games. He is very pleased with it.
1,Great product for the price. I got it for my kids during thanksgiving and they love it
1,Spending money on the cheaper one with ads is worth it. The ad only pops up when you first turn it on and that's it. Have not had any issues with it in the few weeks we've had it.
1,"I have 2 of these; 1 Echo for the office, 1 Echo for home. Use them all the time, especially now with Amazon Music Unlimited."
1,This product was extremely easy to set up and use. The whole family enjoys asking questions and the clarity of the speaker is great. We love the ability to link it to other smart products throughout the house.
1,"It downloads any book you want, I'm an Amazon prime customer with books unlimited and I love reading any book I want as many time I want for just 9.99 a month. The kindle is just the right size and shows grrreeat!"
1,Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
1,"The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
0,I dont like the kindle because u cant connect it chromecast!
1,I bought it for my son and he has now been using it extensively for the past 2 months. His primary use is to play games and he gets bored with every game soon. So he has to find and download a new one every few days. I occasionally use it to watch some online videos as well. We'd have loved if it were a bit faster but at the price it's not something we can complain about. Overall we are both satisfied with the purchase.
0,Bought as a gift for mom. I've seen one before nothing spectacular but they work. Fixed a screen for a friends last year. It took maybe 20 minutes so that's a plus.
1,"Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing."
1,"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat."
1,My husband loves it!! He likes telling Alexa to play music and to tell jokes
1,Pretty cool device. I mainly use it to stream music. I'm sure she could do some more things than I have asked her to but she does most of what I want her to
1,It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
1,"great tablet for a beginner .easy to use,fast.perfect for kids"
1,Worth the money! Use it all the time with no issues!
1,This is an amazing tablet for the price! I bought 4 at Christmas for the grands and one for me!
1,I just love this product can't wait to add to it and be able to turn on and off lights.
1,"They have so much stuff that I am not sure where to start. Its fast, reliable, and easy to set up. I have the yearly Amazom Prime membership and it includes their tv service and also their music app with no ads. A must have if your into watching a lot of tv like myself."
1,"I only use tablet for downloading books to read. Great for that, although sometimes loses place."
1,"I have owned an Echo since they were first released. This purchase was a Mother's Day gift. My mom has limited mobility and loves her new Echo. She uses it every day, especially to stream music and check the weather."
1,I gave this for Christmas to my 12 year old child. He been using it all the time to resd. He has download books from the library. He will try using it for schhool. We use to go the the library every week and he would come home with 8-10 books.and these would pile up around the house. Now all in the Kindle! Good clear screen. Glad i upgraded to the better one. Easy to set up as he open the box and did it all himself.
1,"I have had a Kindle Fire for years, but find I can't read it very well in the bright sun. I bought my Kindle paper white for camping and it's perfect out in the direct sun, by the pool. It's also smaller and fits it the pocket of my pool bag easier. Now one stays home, and one stays in the camper."
1,"Fun discovering uses for the Echo. I can already see that the more I use it, the more useful it will become."
1,Does everything I expected. Plus things I didn't know it could do.
1,I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her
1,I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!
1,"I have this model Kindle and purchased another for a gift.He is not very savy but Kindle makes it sooo easy, he is happy.Such an easy tablet!"
1,You never feel alone when Alexa is around. She is like another member of the family.
1,The product is great for easy no hands control of music. The speaker is loud enough to replace many Bluetooth speakers.
1,"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
1,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV product, first I had the Fire TV stick which was great but a little under-power so I went ahead and upgraded to the Fire TV box and I have to say that this box is great. The streaming picture is gorgeous!! I am using it hard wired so I can't talk about the Wifi, but the videos load basically instantly and it never looks pixelated. I installed Kodi and it works great!!, Alexa is very handy and can even do shopping lists for you. The only thing that I don't like is that the search feature on the box it only gives you results from the Amazon Video store, it doesn't give you results from Netflix, Hulu or others. It has a MicroSD card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of games, the remote works great and comes with batteries. Overall is a great box and if you have an Amazon Prime subscription is definitely a must!! You won't find a better and more organized Amazon instant video app."
1,I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.
1,It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
1,"I recently replaced a Xiaomi Mi Box, with this Fire TV box, and its been nothing short of excellent content availability and flawless performance, it just works great, should have bought this in the first place, instead of cheaping out with the Mi Box."
1,Love these units. Have alexa on multiple floors now and just added 2 dots as well. Can't complain. Sometimes doesn't understand what I am saying but very good a majority of the time.
1,"I like this device because it keeps my niece and nephew happy while on the road. For the price, it can't be beat. It's not as intuitive as it could be."
1,Great product but every hard to get a hand on one very user friendly
1,"This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones."
0,Love the tablet! Got it for my niece and nephew! Great for beginners!!
1,Very easy to set up and use. No issues very simple
1,This is everything the echo is but portable. You're not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach. A recent update was made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated controls.
1,"Had an old Kindle, and this one blows that one out of the water. Easy to read in low light and with lots of light. Kindle really stepped up their game and I'm glad I got a new one."
1,I was so ecstatic to get my fire tv and. It has some really great features on it. Its a must have purchase and i own several. If your a prime member you get free tv from Amazon. Please give it a try it will be worth your money.
1,Great gift for my mother who loves her social media and e-books.
1,"This tablet is a great buy. It does many things and keeps my kids happy. I'm very pleased, we have 2 of them."
1,Nice Streamer. Has lots of movies and Television Showes.
1,The Amazon Fire Tables is really easy to read books on and play games and it stays charged for a long time...
1,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.
1,"The echo provides you with weather updates, what's playing at the local theaters, updated News, plays voice activated games, plays your favorite music on demand, alarm clock, tells you what time it is, you can use it to turn on/off your lights, lock doors there's a variety of free apps to use it canhelp you with recipes for cooking, recipes for making drinks, has an app for health care. There are so many things that this echo can do. Highly recommend it."
1,Got this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he loves it light weight and its able to do so much
1,"It isn't blazing fast....but fine for streaming music to a Bluetooth device. Hey....for $39 at BB I'm not complaining. Amazon appstore somewhat limited, but you can download android .apk apps (like Firefox, Opera Browser,etc) that work fine. Silk browser can be speeded up a bit with settings adjustments. Buy a class 10 micro-sd card (they're soo cheap now) because you only get 8GB onboard and will get used up real fast. Wireless not dual band so forget 5G, but does have decent range. People say screen resolution not fantastic, but I've watched many a network show with TW Cable app and HD is pretty decent."
1,Great smooth tablets with many apps to choose from
1,I love love my Amazon Fire TV. It was super easy to set up and get going. I have access to even more than I thought I would. So easy to use and we have had no problems at all. I cannot recommend this enough!
1,Great device to use for streaming tv shows & movie
0,"Everything I had read was a bit confusing on how the Echo can control it.. but low and behold it has the Alexa service built into it. The Echo CANNOT control the Amazon Fire TV which was the sole reason I bought it. Well.. also in hopes that HBO Now would have Surround Sound on it, but of course it didn't. So they're both at fault here and the reason why I returned it immediately. Since neither of the above worked, this made the device completely redundant with my Chromecast."
1,I love the fact that it can take a lick and keeping on ticking my grandson is a bit rough on things.
1,The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
1,"it is white, and it is much better than kindle 6, so paperwhite is a very good product."
1,Good price while on sale. Also reward is the reason I go there
1,I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
1,"The whole family enjoys having ""Alexa"" play music and other features."
1,I've got this as a gift for my grandmother and she's not tech savvy but she can work a kindle. She loves to read and is very pleased with it.
1,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.
1,I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is
1,The screen is absolutely amazing on the eyes. I can read for long stretches of time without any eye strain and the battery lasts forever.
0,I bought a kindle fire. It serves my purpose of reading pdf files.
1,Love my purchase of my Amazon fire Hd 8. It was a very good experience
1,"Helped me ""Cut the Cord"" on television subscripton bills"
1,My wife and I couldn't be happier with our Amazon Echo! With our home wifi it was so easy to setup ! Alexa what did we ever do without you ! Look if your looking at reviews then you've done some research and know what the Echo is all about and all it can do ! Don't hesitate buy it now !
1,I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one.
1,"The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up."
1,Got for my 9 year old grandson. Durable & plenty fast for his games. No more squenting to see his phne
1,"Fun. It does everything as advertised. Favorite purchase in a long time! Still discovering more and more things that the Echo is capable of, but I totally love this!"
1,streaming is flawless on this device. my 4k tv looks great when sending video from this firetv.
1,Great tablet for a 4 year old to put learning games on
1,Really enjoy the variety of music and getting answers to all types of questions. A fun device!
1,Great gift idea got it for my father for a Christmas gift
1,"Simple but effitient. I bought it to use mainly as a good cost benefit music player device. The Fire has some limited apps for the purpose I get it but it works fine. As I had no tablets yet I discovered I can use it for other things. Yes, it works fine as a tablet and I am learning to love it."
0,"Bought this hoping for a cheaper version of iPad. Not familiar with OS. overall, not excited about it"
1,"Great tablet, for kids and adults. Love it, it's my backup for paying bills etc."
1,"Could not beat the price and the kindle fire is a nice tablet to have for reading, playing games, letting grandkids play on."
0,Returned item because my phone did everything Alexa does. The best thing was the quality of the speaker.
1,A little difficult for inexperienced to setup but good price.
1,My brother-in-law and his family have enjoyed it very much. He says finding songs is better and faster than Pandora
1,Bought item to keep my grandma entertained. She uses it every day.
1,Once set up is completed it is very easy to use many options available I was able to link my iPhone to echo and it has made my experience much more enjoyable.
1,"Fire TV provides a full range of choices from multiple sources, including Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Showtime Anytime, among others.."
1,Nice product when you are on the run and want the latest on the weather conditions as you are running out the door. If you like to cook or bake the recipes are right at your fingertips!
1,It's doing a great job .. just go for it without doubt..
0,The tablet is great for reading. It does not allow you to download many of the games my child enjoys which are usually available on other tablets.
1,Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.
0,"It is ok for the average user. But it os not good enough for Kodi. The interface is ok, but a little too busy for me. I did not like the fact that I could not use my universal Harmony remote with it. Jodi also takes almost an hour to set up and it buffers way more than on the Shield."
1,"This is a really good product, super fast and great screen, would buy it again!"
1,Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
1,"Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet."
1,"Using it in the kitchen mainly. It has good sound, works excellent as a cooking timer. Also alarm for certain events thruout the day. Nice music source."
1,What a nice little helper for answers to immediate questions! Weather forecast in an instant.
1,Bought it for my niece who is autistic and she loves it . works great and easy to use.
1,"This is pretty cool! It has a good variety of options to work with and games, which is even better! Haha!"
1,I love this little tablet it is about the size of a large paperback book. perfect for e-reader or kindle apps. small enough to carry around with very little weight. fast processor an lots of free apps you can use. also has expandable memory card-bonus!
1,Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids
0,"Gets the job done as a tablet I guess, apps are limited but this isn't meant to be a full on tablet, its a reader. It does freeze ad glitch a little but for the price I guess its worth it."
1,"I like the echo, and it's really handy. It's a little creepy that it listens to EVERY WORD uttered, but there are some handy things that you can get out of this appliance."
1,For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
1,Probably the best available streaming device. Would recommend this to anybody tired of apple tv's limits!
1,I thought it would have more skills but overall it work in progress
1,Great gift! Would definitely recommend to family and friends
1,Overall its not bad. I like all that it offers I just wish it wasn't so finicky. You ask it a question and will say hmm i don't have the answer to that. And then ask it the same question again just slightly different it's is able to answer. None the less its a good buy.
1,This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!
1,"Okay, so I am a slow adopter of using Kindle readers, but I have made stupendous use of this since buying it. I use it at work for keeping up to date with business journals and reading books on management styles and skills. Even my original intent was for use at work I find myself reading additional books for my personal entertainment more often. Screen is very easy to read in varying light conditions and menu is easily navigated. I am thinking of buying more of these for gifts at work for my employees at Christmas time."
1,I bought it almost a month ago and I've no complaints so far with it. It's a nice little ereader that does its job.
1,I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
1,I love this ..the sound is so good i like it better than the small one and Alexa can hear me even im far. It was an amazing product and i got good deal of course fr Best Buy!
1,This is a really great item for a really great price.
1,So far the Amazon Echo has been great especially at the discounted price. I'm still trying things with the Echo and I also have the Google Home and so far I'm giving the edge to the Amazon Echo as it looks like they have a head start on features.
1,"Love to get up to date information on weather, traffic and events in my area."
1,"I bought an Amazon Fire tablet for $50 and it's been able to handle anything I throw at it. I even run Kodi and other apps on it. I have a Bluetooth keyboard with word processing app, and even an external mouse for it. Finally, it runs emulators too. Love my fire tablet. It's the best $50 I ever spent."
1,The Amazon Echo is a very high tech assistant that will control your your whole home.
1,Great product for children at this price...makes good Christmas gift
1,"This is the best electronic that I have bought in a longtime I love Alexa by echo I can play Pandora, iheart radio, Amazon music etc... The sound is great and the voice control is a big plus"
1,"We love our echo, Alexa! We use her all the time. Synched to our phones, and she's almost more helpful than a spouseRecommend this to any and everyone"
1,This was a gift for my friend and he absolutely Love it. He tells me all the time how his kids always wants to use it.
0,"I bought the Amazon Fire to have easily portable access to my email and the Internet while traveling. It is a good basic tablet. Some of the text is somewhat hard to read as of is quite small. I don't have a stylus which would make use much easier. Overall, it is a good value for my limited need's and use."
1,I purchased this because I can add memory to it...and it's the best Kindle I've bought so far (this is about the fifth one I've purchased)...I like it so much that I bought one for my kids as well!
1,Great for kids its durable and lets them play games etc.. so they leave our cell phones alone LOL
1,"Not my first Kindle but my third of this model. Keep buying them for family!Really the best model out there for ease, weight, flexibility.Cannot recommend it enough."
0,"The apps I really want it won't let me download. I don't like that I HAVE to sign up for ""One Click"" with a credit card."
1,Much better than the stick. It allows you to plug directly into your router. Minimizes buffering by so much!!! Get this over the stick!!
1,"My kids use these things daily. We had to replace two after about a year. One got smashed and the other has the digitizer die. Great on trips, as they typically keep the kids quiet."
0,"Very simple, works good for checking email and surfing. Very Amazon intense. Lots of advertising."
1,"My kids love Alexa & the continued responses. Alexa responds well to anyone's voice in our family. There is so much potential to what Alexa can do, but unfortunately, not something we can continue to put extra money into purchasing all the possible extras right now. We'll just have to add a little here & there."
1,"I love this Kindle. This is the second one I have purchased. It's easy to use, had great background light."
1,"It was a gift, so i can really only comment on the quality of the box. It was very square and well proportioned. The cellophane was slick but not overly so. Overall a decent tactile sensation."
1,would be nice with some simple start up directions and links to website hints.
1,Love this Alexa! Great sound! Technology has come a long way!
1,I love this amazon fire tv! I use it all the time. The picture is crisp and the device is super fast!
1,I bought this for my brother-in-law. He is not a techie but had someone set it up for him. He loves it
1,"I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round."
1,My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years
1,"Best kindle I'd had yet, and i've had almost all of them. The lighting doesn't affect your sleep like a tablet and the page turns are instantaneous. Nice and lightweight too"
1,Truly glare free in any light! Very easy to download books from Amazon including linking to my local library.
1,My grandson takes it on trips and he loves it. It's easy to use.
1,i brought this for my house and i love this fire tv! i can watch just all sort of internet things on it! best thing i have brought in a long time for TV.
1,When my old kindle died I purchased the Paperwhite. Great for reading! Much lighter weight than previous one. Now able to read in sunlight without difficulty and am able to use with another source of light.
1,Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.
1,Pretty good value tablet. Works like expected and has some good apps. Only downside with memory at 8gigs.
1,"Purchased over two months ago. Works as advertised, and is very handy to have when you need information."
1,Bought two for 2 small boys to use instead of being on the phone and I really like it. Easy to link account. Good parent locks on it and easy enough to navigate
1,It works good I would recommend to friends and family
1,"For under $50 you can read books, watch TV or play an endless assortment of free apps. Battery life is excellent. Great investment!"
0,"Wondering why I spent $150 for the Echo when I could have purchased the Dot for $40 and does everything the Echo does...and more! With the Dot you can stream music to Bluetooth speakers, which can't be done with the Echo."
1,"It's Light weight,... easy to read in any light level ... especially outside, which is a nice improvement from my last one."
1,can't imagine being without a kindle now that I have had one. Sure beats carrying around books that don't easily fit into a purse!
1,did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.
1,My daughter loves the device. Only had it a few days
0,Concerns about syncing our phones to Echo and difficulty loading music was a deal breaker. Maybe its operator error. Not for us.
1,I am still learning all the things that Echo can do. Love finding new skills and using them.
1,This was a gift for my kids. They love them. Easy to use and lots of great apps!
1,"My wife needed a new Kindle....her previous one just ""died"".....she loves the new size, features, and screen....much improved compared to her original Kindle....I highly recommend if you are in the market for an e-reader."
0,"Full disclosure, I've only had iPads in the past. I needed an android based tablet as a 3rd party app that I needed was yet IOS supported. You get what you pay for. Build quality, touch and feel, yes it's equal to the price. Constant adds urging you to make various Amazon based purchases...not my cup of tea but I guess fills a price point and need."
1,Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
1,The Amazon Fire Tablet is great for the price. Great stuffing stockers.
1,"I believe it could be a little faster. Screen isn't very tough, broke in a few months."
1,I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
1,I bought this for my dad. He loves it and it's easy to use.
1,Easily the best one of the various kindles I have had.
1,The best streamer for the money and for beginners. I love my Amazon box.
1,"My granddaughter love her tablet. She loves watching movies, and learning new things."
1,I thoroughly enjoy the product it is really great and the best ever build by any company.
1,"Obviously this is not the best tablet in its class, but its a great value for the price."
1,Use it all the time. Simple to set up and start using.
1,Love it anyday compared to Apple TV.Can program it and add your own apps with ease.
1,"Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue."
1,bought this for my 3 year old to watch youtube and movies. it does the trick.. sometimes runs a little slow.
1,"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."
1,The kindle paperwhite is an excellent product. I already have it . This is a gift my friend.
0,I got it for $34 during thanksgiving . Bought for my parents. Works as intended.ConsCamera if you really care
1,These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!
1,I bought this as a present for someone and they were delighted. They love that it is compact and easy to use.
1,"My first Kindle, but the backlight feature is great"
1,"Great tablet for the grandkids, they love it great item"
1,Couldn't go without it. Old one conked out on vacation and this was great. Sister has one too.
1,I tried to get this since Christmas and it's finally available. Can't wait to use it.
1,You will use and enjoy this every day. It's a wide open connection that will amaze and surprise you.
1,"I bought the Amazon Echo when it first came out, and I loved it so much that I purchased one for another room in my house. Easy set up, great sound quality, and Alexa is very knowledgeable and informative."
1,We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!
1,Doesn't really answer my questions but can set timers and tell me the weather
1,I love my fire tablet . I even got one for my son who had a Digiland & this tablet outdose it. Love it!
1,"I bought Two Echos. One for home and one for work. Very nice to just say ""Alexa play my music"" or ""Alexa what is the local weather forecast?"" I highly recommend this wonderful entertainment item! Also, very convenient to take on trips that you are staying with wifi. Easy pac too!"
1,"My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
1,"I purchased the two tablets for two of my three grand children, they are both very happy with the fire tablets and things have been very peaceful in my son's house since i gave them to the kids."
1,"I own a business in finance and need to read a lot on varied subjects. the kindle enables me to find referenced books and download them in a few seconds. I haven't tried but apparently you can even upload your own pdfs. The fonts and screen resolution and lighting are extremely pleasant, and it is easier to hold than a book. I removed 1 star because the highlighting and note taking systems can get laggy, images are sometimes hard to zoom on, and you can't copy paste a quote. But overall because of the access and convenience it offers I highly recommend it."
1,"This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!"
1,The echo is so much fun! I have added 2 echo dots also & the Philips Hue lighting system. I love it!
1,So far so good I am absolutely loving this tablet and its durability . neat features and abilities for the price!
1,"I bought this fire tv to try it out at my business. I didn't want to pay for cable or satellite, so I gave it a go. I'm happy I did, now I don't have to worry about anything. I have everything I need right there from music to movies. It keeps my guest happy so it's a win for me."
1,"I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!"
1,"We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it."
1,Best tablet for the price!Bought 2 of this and enjoying a lot!
1,"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
1,"Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media."
1,The many features make this an ideal tablet purchase.
1,Purchased as a gift for teenager. Love that it encourages her to read and lets her do other light web.
1,Excellent in all light conditions. Easy to use. Just what was required.
1,"This device has met my expectations. I read the other reviews and just had to give it a try. The display is easy on the eyes, noticeably more so than a regular tablet. It's lightweight and fits easily in my purse. No complaints here. :)"
1,It is very easy to use. It also comes with 30 free prime which is a plus to be able to use. It is kid friendly.
1,"I had previously purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick, which worked OK, but was lacking in some areas. I upgraded to the full-blown Amazon Fire TV mainly because of the faster Wi-Fi that is included. It makes a substantial difference when streaming HD content. Additionally, this unit has a faster processor and more memory than the Fire TV Stick. To me it is well worth the extra $$."
1,Inexpensive alternative to standard Kindle e-readers.
1,"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"
1,Fast and easy transaction. Outstanding product....
1,I bought it in thanksgiving.its very cheap and has got good features for that.
1,"This e reader is easy on the eyes, light weight, has an adjustable back light, and has a decent storage size. It only does black and white so be aware of that if you have books with pictures or images."
1,I love my paperwhite. It is so much easier to read.
1,I really didn't know what to expect when I picked up an echo. I understood that it was a Wifi/Bluetooth enabled speaker that had Siri like capabilities but it really ended up being so much more. Truly you can hands free do everything from get basic info that you would normally look up on google to controlling your connected home to resupplying toilet paper through Amazon. Of course it has its novelty items like telling you jokes to singing you happy birthday. Truly this is the beginning of having an 'Iron Man' home. Just needs some fine tuning in its voice recognition and more features. Excited to see what Amazon adds to it in the future!
1,Does a good job answering your questions. Easy set-up.
1,Love the Kindles. I give them for gifts. Love access to free books
1,I had bought one for my bedroom back in december of 2015 and bought another one for my living room. I am a cord cutter and have zero complaints about this product. I have amazon prime as well so that adds even more to the amount of shows I can watch. Love it!
1,You get what you pay for. The camera is terrible but I bought it for games and reading. The ads can get annoying but for what I paid for its a good product
1,My step son never really used a tablet before and he has no problem picking this up and just using it.
1,Great for book lovers. Worth the investment given the cheaper price of e-books.
1,I think the Echos are terrific personal assistants. This is my second large Echo. I like the larger speakers in the big Echo. But I also like the Dots well enough to buy five of them. Alexa is all over my house!
1,Had to take first one back because the screen went haywire. The second one is doing great. Love how much it holds.
1,"Just needs more memory, but we can handle that. My boys love them!"
0,"I had a lower end kindle for years. When that broke, I decide to buy the higher end one that is backlit. The back litghting is nice for reading at night. But the touch features are too jumpy--it jumps pages instead of just turning to the next one. It is cumbersome to buy through amazon and difficult to see the list of what you have. I don't know if I'd buy this one over the lowest end one again."
1,"Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one."
0,I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.
1,I love this!! It makes it very easy to listen to music and find topics of interest and places to go.
1,I bought two of these items. The first was for my mother in law. She is visually challenged and it was recommended by her doctor. The second I received as a fathers day gift. The first one had issues that required a return and replacement. It now works fine. Exchanged at Best Buy with no problem. The only problem I see is the limitation on available apps. But that is a minor issue at this point. For the money you can't beat it.
1,I purchased this as a gift but was told by the person that I gave it to that they loved it!
1,this is my fifth kindle i have bought. I love them.
1,I love this tablet. It has great quality and functions just like an apple tablet yet you save hundreds. I love how it also connects to alexa dot. Apple doesn't have that.
1,"Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
1,Good ereader if you only want to download books. Easy to download from my local library and Amazon.
1,I have been using Kindle for several years now but my old one was starting to freeze and had problems connecting to the internet sometimes. This new one is a great replacement. I like that it is backlit and that it syncs to the latest page read with the Kindle app on my iphone. Great purchase.
1,"Read books, shop, browse the Internet. Just what I need it for. Great tablet. I bought one for me and one as a gift. We both love it!"
0,great for toddlers. I recommend anyone to purchase a protective case
1,I bought his for my eight year old and he loves it. Amazon has many apps both for games and educational that he benefits from every day
1,I bought the Fire TV in able to watch Prime Videos. I have a Smart TV and an Apple TV. They all work about the same they each have their unique features features.
1,I got this as a Christmas present. Had wondered if it really was so easy on the eyes and good in different lighting. Much better than I had hoped!
1,"This is a Great little unit for the price! Pretty quick with the four processors, good apps as well. Very pleased!"
1,"Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee."
1,"I was hesitant at first to buy it. But now I use it daily. Definitely recommended if you have an Amazon prime account. You can watch movies and listen to music on here. I bought the fire tv instead of the stick for future use of 4k content. It also has a micro sd slot, usb port, and digital audio port. With the support of apps you can stream content from your home networked PCs also."
1,Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere
1,This reader has everything I wanted except the ability to download books directly. It is extremely easy to read and a perfect size for transport
1,"I really love my Echo, love the voice controls and the ease of life now that ALexa is here."
1,Nice tablet... the only downsize I see is you don't have the play store... so apps are limited
1,"This device is very interesting and I am just learning the possibilities that it can be used to do. I get the weather, the morning news highlights and it will find the kind of music that I like. I also understand it can be integrated into my home security system. I am looking forward to exploring the possibilities."
1,love
1,Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
1,Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun
1,"I was pleasantly surprised that I have enjoyed the Kindle Fire. This was my first ever use of buying books on Kindle due to summer courses I was taking at the time in May/June 2016. WHAT I LIKED- Kindle Books Synched on MacBook and Fire tablet: very helpful when it came time to write my papers. The highlights I made while I read the book on the tablet synched to the version I read on the MacBook desktop. This helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes.- Watching Videos: cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. - Amazon Shopping: I can now understand people's Amazon shopping addictions.l I will give it to Amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using Prime and countless hours of online browsing. Prior to this I rarely purchase items online, I can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. - Portability: I like that I will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE- Sign-on Screen Ads:There is no way to turn them off. I suppose for $39/49 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. However, I wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, I may have paid the money and upgraded to the next Kindle if I had known it could not be turned off. - Turning Off/Standby Mode: This took some time to get used to rather than an issue. When you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. You have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned OFF. - Weather App: I don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. It takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. I have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. I have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. But at this point the app is worthless. - Screen Resolution: It's not the best, but I got used to it. For reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. - Screen Dimmer/Blue Light Mode: I read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. And the system's default dimmer and Blue Light feature is awful. The Blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. The app I use instead is called Bluelight Blocking. And even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. So I have had to download the app Dimly so be able to set the brightness."
1,I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
1,The tablet has good versatility and is an excellent device for young children.
1,"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable."
1,Best tablet you can get in the price range. Very dependable and hasn't had any issues. Got it for my mom for reading books and doing some internet browsing. Was very easy for her to learn and my kids use it when they are at her house too. Would recommend.
1,This was a replacement for a well used Kindle - wife like it even better than her first and uses it a lot
1,"Love this!!! Great screen, easy to read in different lighting, and long battery life! The Amazon website has far more reviews for books and books are sometimes cheaper. Highly recommend."
1,This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.
1,We bought the tablet as a gift for my daughter. It has great restrictions. You can set time limits for learning versus playtime. Excellent picture/screen quality.
1,"I use this with Kodi, HBO go, directv now, Hulu, prime, and Netflix. Everything runs smooth. I like having the USB port, because I have a controller, wireless keyboard and flash drive that I connect when needed. Can't ask for better."
1,easy to use and has enough space. I highly recommend this product. Also a great gift
1,This is such an improvement over the original Kindle. The pages are easier to read in any light.
1,My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry
1,I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.
1,Bought online. BLack Friday and had options on colors. Avoided hassles in store and had prompt delivery.
1,"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
1,Very helpful product helps me with my appointments.
1,"I have been reading on a paperwhite for a few years now. When it got damaged I just went right out and bought another. It's light, easy to see without my reading glasses, since I can change the font, and it's great for reading outside, even in full sun. It's worth every penny."
1,I find the overall function of the system to be good. The Far-Field feature works well. The one thing I find to be weak is the speaker. The sound during play back of music is not crisp nor clean. You could purchase the Dot and connect it to another speaker for better sound...save some money on the unit this way as well.
1,Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.
1,Great product for music and smart home devices. using it to control philip Hue.
1,Great tablet at a great price. lots of good features
1,My wife likes the fact that it's back-lit to make it easier to read.
1,It's great for reading in bed or anywhere for that matter.
1,"I received this as a Father's Day gift. I enjoy using it quite a bit. I like the Flash Briefing the best. I also use it to play ""Thunderstorm Sounds"" for relaxing white noise. Easy to set up, easy to operate, and useful with the Alexa app on my phone."
1,"Bought 2 for main TVs in the house. Fast processor and no buffering encountered with HD picture quality. Great for various streaming services, lots of free movies and shows if Amazon Prime member, and loading Kodi opens up much more options for free!"
1,Comes with a bunch of apps to watch TV and to play games as well.
1,"son is enjoying the whole tablet. He is glad it is a quality product, bought from our favorite store."
1,The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
1,"the only issue is the advertisement that Amazon put on the Kindle now, other than that great product, long lasting battery life."
1,I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it.
1,We love this tablet and I bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter. She's able to use it with no problems.
1,I use an Iphone but I needed a reliable Android machine to play many android games I've purchased. This fits the bill and runs Android fairly well for the price. Don't expect to push TOO much power out of this model but with some clever tweaking you can get this thing to bypass the Fire OS and do all your Android app needs.
1,"With the cost of cable being overly costly, I've looked at ways to cut the cable. Adding an HD antenna for local channels, I opted for a FireTv to supplement our tv watching. I already had a Netflix and Hulu streaming account ($20 a mo) so already saving $100+ per mo. Add the benefit of adding numerous free apps...you have a great amount of programming you can enjoy."
1,"This is the best streaming device for anyone. You can use any of your streaming accounts. Netflix,Hulu,Kodi. You will not be disappointed"
1,Bought this tablet for my brother for Xmas and he loved it. He is able to watch Netflix on his tablet. Recommend it for kids. I will be buying my sister one now too.
1,Good tablet so far. My kids have really enjoyed it and have not put down since they got it.
1,"Almost 5 stars, dosent have all songs from different musicians."
1,"my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use"
1,Bought this for my wife as second amazon tablet that ask for and got what she wanted. Now she's enjoying it!
1,"Awesome product, would purchase again! I highly recommend."
1,A great product my family loves Alexa. She is like a new addition to the family. On the spot info when you need it.
1,"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy. Then this is the unit for you.I hope this helps."
0,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update
1,"I like it the echo works good to, I am going to buy another"
1,Great product easy to use. I was very please due to the user interface
0,It's hard to give a review cause it's stuck on Amazon home screen. It might be a good product but I don't know
1,"im loving this Amazon kindle reader, its the easy one to use."
1,"I purchased this e-reader during black friday and am very happy with it thus far. It is thin, light weight, and very portable. Highly recommended for casual and avid readers out there."
1,"I purchased the Amazon FireTV to access Playstation Vue, thereby reducing my monthly cost of viewing from $130.86 to $35 (other package viewing options available at affordable costs). The FireTV is 4K compatible providing a great picture with my 4K and non-4K TVs, no noticeable lag time with transition between channels or other options, and it can be used for cost effective/free streaming. I now have more very affordable viewing options than I ever had! I love the Amazon FireTV and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
1,"I like the speed of the fire TV .I use to have a fire TV stick ,then upgraded to the fire tv: I'm very satisfied"
1,i bought this tablet because I didn't want to spend over a 100$ on a tablet that would not get much use. I use it mostly to read books and articles online. It has a brightness reducing function which is really great.
1,"I was uncertain about the fire tablet since I own an iPad mini. Bought it for my mother and love it! It works smoothly, the system is awesome and my mother loves it as well! I also got the HD 8 for my daughter"
1,"My 6year old twin boys loves technology and the Fire 7 Tablet is perfect for them. Just the right size to sit and play or pack and go. The icons are super easy to understand for beginners as such. I've downloaded fun games, apps, and books for them to utilize already. The price was awesome as well especially since I purchased two at the same time."
0,Pretty dumb that you have to.buy a charger port
1,Bought these for my kids and wife. Kids love it and wife like sit as well. Wish it had Google play store though.
1,This is the second one I have purchased in the last 2 months for a gift.
1,Works faster then the stick. I have both. Runs smooth
1,I have been using this for awhile and it definitely meets my expectations. It sounds great. It works all my lights.
1,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games.
1,"I own tablets, have a surface pro 4, and have a smart phone. I have the kindle app on all these devices and it works great. This issue with them though is that they aren't always that convenient to carry around. Or, if they are, the battery will tend to die. The paperwhite fixes both of these issues. It's very light and feels great in your hands. The screen is amazing and I never have any kind of issues with being unable to see it due to sunlight, a dark room, etc. But probably most amazing of all is the battery life. It's been 2.5 weeks since I bought my kindle and fully charged it... I just now finally went a little below half battery life. I use mine to read books and graphic novels. Both look fantastic on the device."
1,Very pleased with the fire tv. Works faster than the fire stick. More bang for the dollar.
1,"This is a great gift for anyone that loves technology. Great to listen to music, news, radio or for reference."
1,Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps. Go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore. Made my Fire into regular android tablet. Much happier now.
1,"I was looking for a good tablet, to use for movies, music. And to browse internet And when i saw that this tablet was on sale I had to buy it! and I'm glad I did. This is a great tablet and it""s light i carry in my purse. I Love it!"
1,Got this for the wife for Christmas. We are prime members. She and the kids 4&7 year olds love Alexa being able to play music or have her tell a joke just by saying aleXa play me this or tell me a joke is a trip
1,"the amazon echo is a wonderful piece of technology. She tells jokes, plays music and you can play games with her too. there are more practical uses as well. She can control your wifi enabled household devices, like turning lights on or adjusting the AC. The equipment to do that is still pretty pricey, but she is good just for entertainment. The only bad part is, she can't push audio out to my bluetooth speakers. I think the DOT can but not the echo."
1,"Tablet is great value. I brought two for my kids and they love it. Later I brought one for myself just to have a light entertainment device on the fly. The resolution on the tablet is good but don't expect the resolution of a Samsung or Apple tablet. I like the Amazon interface because you can download certain movies or shows if your a Amazon prime member. I don't think Amazon prime movies or shows are available on non-Amazon tablets so this increases the value. Some people don't like the fact that the locked screen has advertising I think it's great. It's a clever way to bring a product to the market that is affordable, reliable, and built well."
1,Great product for the price. Makes it easier to read with the contrast in text and background.
1,"Works great and is a must have for cord cutters. I switch from an AppleTV and couldn't be happier. Interface is easy to use, processor is ""snappy"", and there is a large list of apps for it."
1,I like this much better than the roku that we had and more options
1,like the firs one that folds in prongs better
1,"I have always been an avid paper book reader. Never thought I could convert! Purchased the Kindle at Best Buy and I am totally hooked! Love the convenience as well as simp,e access to books (inexpensive) on line."
1,Echo is a great product that continues to improve. I love the white!
1,I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
1,Best streaming device I know. Easy to use. Great purchase
1,Echo has a better than expected speaker that plays music well. Hook it up to spotify through the alexa app and tell it what you want to hear.
1,We have had so much fun! Everything that is advertised she does is correct.
1,It is a great phone for a great price. It has the latest Android Lollipop 5.1.It also has 8Gb. of internal memory.
1,Its awesome and of course better than the last gen. Love the HD screen.
1,"Got this for my parents to allow my dad to bring music into his family room,. I own both the echo and thee Dot. Love the simplicity of the personal assistant. Connected to my Hue lights, and nest thermostat. Alexa allows my wife to control our lights, play music or get a flash briefing via voice commands. Speaker is Pretty good for a stand alone unit. Voice recognition is very good. If you have home automation devices like hue, wink, nest or othe, the Echo makes them better than ever"
1,alexa is a great gift have given to family and friends always a great feedback
1,I thought I was going to hate not reading a paper copy book. But to my surprise I do not mind it ar all. I do still like the hard copy book but it's nice to have the Kindle handy whenever!
1,The fire TV is much faster and more polished. I highly recommend it.
1,It's awesome.. makes lole sp much easier. Hands free music. And my kid loves it!
1,This is a good product with good reviews. Would recommend
1,"My girlfriend is a bookwork and she absolutely loves her Kindle Paperwhite. We tried getting the standard Kindle first, but that just didn't do it for her as she likes to read in the dark as well. The Paperwhite was the perfect investment for her, and I'm considering getting one for myself."
1,works well but you must enable a lot of skills and then remember the right way to ask alexa a question
1,"This was on such a good deal that I couldn't resist it. I purchased two of these for my 6 and 3 year old children. They don't need anything grand, but this is more than suitable for them to learn, play, and enjoy some technology. It performs well and I hope it continues to last."
1,"I love the Amazon fireTV, It's very fast & user friendly, I will purchase more of them for Christmas girts."
1,This our second paper white my husband loves the lighting on it
1,Would recommend to everyone. Good buy and does what I needed.
1,The tablet is not incredibly easy to use and to load stuff onto.
1,This is a simple tablet - light and very portable for a child. There are many free apps available and they work fine on this tablet.
1,Bought it for my 5 yr old grand daughter and she absolutely loves it! The Kidzobe package is the best
1,"My family received this Echo at Christmas, and it is used almost daily. Listening to music, adding to shopping lists, asking trivia, etc. we loved it so much, this now lives downstairs, and we have an Echo Dot in each bedroom."
1,"Store salesman recommended the Fire over ROKU which I had history with. Stated that you get more with FIRE. What I find is that they are very different in how they actually operate. ROKU is more user friendly while the FIRE is more tech savvy and can be open sourced to some degree. One is good for very computer knowledgeable on how to manipulate software and the other ""ROKU"" is better at a user friendly interface that is more preditable."
1,"I bought this tablet for my 19 year old nephew for Xmas. He's currently enrolled in his sophomore year in college. I figured he could use this for some homework, projects but also for fun. After taking out and playing with it a little bit, I bought another for my mom and my 13 year old niece!"
1,I bought this for myself for Christmas and we've been using it listening to holiday favorites station it is very nice and it sounds great
1,"Excellent gift for kids ,not expensive. Good software for less money."
1,Couldn't be happier with this latest Kindle e-reader! Love being able to turn pages by pushing a button and the bright uniform lighting! It's a big step up from my first generation paperweight!
1,"I bought this to replace a dedicated kids tablet (another brand) that had wonderful software but not a replaceable battery. Barely got a year and a half out of the other brand. The price difference between this and the dedicated kids version was largely a software suite subscription so I bought this. Along with her mom we found free and age appropriate software. I loaded up a micro SD card with music and audio stories. Both grand daughters love it, as they are 5 and 3 I bought the bumper to help protect it. It's not in the same league as my Samsung tablet but for 1/8 its cost or 1/6 the cost of the dedicated kid brand it's great."
1,I bought it for one of my friend. He just loved it.
0,It's just ok. Will work but not what I wantedTo controlled by Amazon
1,Nice to download games works well for kids for a great price !
1,"Helpful and entertaining. The more I use, the more it adapts to my needs"
1,Really smart and quick with answers. Reminders and alarms are great. Have to be careful on how loud you say alexia when talking because it is very sensitive. Great product.
1,"I have been and Apple TV guy from the start but was disappointed they chose not to include 4K on there latest model. So I thought I would see what Amazon had to offer. Wow the 4K content available is awesome and growing everyday. All the menu's are easy to use and set up. Very, very, happy with this purchase."
1,Great easy to use product for streaming. Very pleased with it.
1,Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
1,I love the fire tv. I already had the fire stick and decided to give this a try for the living room. I'm very happy with it. Love the fact that I can hook it up through LAN so I doesn't buffer anywhere near as much as the stick
1,I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
1,The whole family enjoys asking Alexa silly questions. We also enjoy playing music on the echo.
0,For the price a decent tablet. Some apps don't want to download.
1,"My niece is 2 years old and she absolutely loves this tablet. It's easy for her to use and navigate through. Plus, it has parental controls which I love. Definitely recommend it."
1,Bought thd Fird for my daughter and she uses it primarily as an e-book reader.
1,Great sound and very responsive to voice commands. Looking forward to using the other skills.
1,Very nice product...Had everything we were looking for...
1,"I actually didn't think I'll be using the Amazon Echo as much as I do when I decided to buy it. It's definitely become a something that's called on for everyday purposes from playing music to checking traffic. I don't really have any complaints except for that the Echo doesn't hear me use its wake word so I feel like I'm screaming at it before it takes action. Overall, very satisfied."
1,A bargain; this tablet is very affordable and the picture quality is very good.
1,"excellent picture quality, it does not froze at all."
1,I bought this not really knowing any Amazon products and I gotta say.... it has become one of my top 5 gadgets! It's aweomse!!!!!!!! I've made my sisters get one too!!!!!
1,I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
1,The Amazon echo works really great and it works well with smart programs.
1,"I got this to replace my iPad. The battery is decent, the quality is good but the sound/volume could be a little better. It doesn't quite get as loud as I would like so I just use a speaker with it. Overall, for the price, you can't really beat it."
1,Excellent Product!
1,I love the many programs you can get from the many apps.
1,best christmas gift ever for myself. My kids loves it also
0,Bought two of these 2015 models to add to my previous model on other sets in the house. Both of the new units freeze after about 10 - 15 minutes stating that my 16 MB connection speed isn't fast enough for watching old documentaries from my Prime account. Cycling the power gets it working until it freezes again. The old model works flawlessly. I'll be returning these.
1,"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this"
1,"I absolutely love my Fire TV! I use it with Netflix, boo boo, ESPN, and a ton of other apps. I highly recommend this product if you plan on cutting cable"
0,"Let me set the stage for this review: I joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot... or at least what I would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decently-long books a month.Up until buying the Paperwhite, I was doing most of my reading on my iPhone using the Kindle app. Long story short, I ended up returning the Paperwhite after about 2 weeks. Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. Dedicated E-Readers are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. If that's not you, then stick with your phone."
0,This tablet has a great price but don't let that fool you. The tablet performs much lower that other tablets I've used.
1,"Works awesome...especially the 4K content. This was an upgrade from an original fire tv box, and works better than the old one."
1,"Good product, easy to use. Fast processor, speedy internet card"
1,works great for me. good for first time user. good for money as well.
1,I really enjoy watching movies on this it's very easy to use and Alexis makes searching a piece of cake
1,This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
1,My 7 year old loves the tablet. It is very durable.
1,"The fire 7 is the best low priced Android tablet in my opinion. The lack of memory is kind of disappointing, but it does have a micro SD slot and for the price you can't expect all high end features."
1,I had an older version of the kindle and was starting to have issues with it so decided to look into a new one. The week I decided it was time to look at purchasing a new one it was on sale! That was an added bonus. This is a great improvement over the one I had and it cost considerably less. It's much faster and has a camera.
1,Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
1,These are very cool. Only bummer is my power adapter cord broke :( and I don't think they sell replacements
1,"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it."
1,"This tablet is excellent. Hard to imagine all these features can be in this unit for under $50.00...It is a must buy, especially if you have children who like to use your tablet. Perhaps buy them one of their own....For us it is one of a few tablets we own, but it is one we are glad to have."
1,This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.
1,Great value great picture quality fast processor lots of streaming content and games
1,It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
1,"I think it is good compliment to regular cable. If you have subcriptions to the various apps (netflix, amazon, hulu etc.) You may be able to eliminate cable all together. It works seamless with remote. The voice feature is ok but I haven't really gotten the jist of it. Overall good product."
1,Love my Kindle! I take it with me everywhere! I would recommend this to all my friends and family!
1,"This is an amazing compact way to enjoy music, games and trivia. I am thinking about getting the add on speakers. Highly recommend!"
1,My kids use the tablet and it works very well. They love it. They take it with them during travel too.
1,"This is the future, Siri/Cortina did help us, but it did not had open API access for customizing. Amazon took that opportunity and release Echo. Great product, lots of new commands coming out per week. Works with your existing home automation systems. This product did level set for any future product like Google Home."
0,"I purchased these for my grandchildren, ages 3 to 9. Not a lot of power/performance but great for the kids. They have downloaded books from amazon and viewed movies on Netflix. One downfall was my Grandson could not connect his tablet to his MiP's robot he received for Christmas. Would not recommend this tablet to those seeking computer performance like that of the large more functional tablets like Samsung Dell and others"
1,It's simple and not difficult for young children to learn. Also is build sturdy in case it does get dropped more than a few times.
1,I love this device! Perfect size for my bad eyesight! Lol! I use it all the time! One down side is the .battery life is not great!
1,"The Amazon Echo is everything it is advertised to bed. The voice recognition is very good - it understands commands from every family member, even when our speech patterns are very different. The variety of skills is impressive. We have been using our Echo for a month, and have only begun to unlock its capability."
1,Love this product ! It is an awesome deviceThank you for selling this at a good price
1,My daughter loves this. Having access to her favorite apps and games is great without all the adult content.
1,I could not find the charger anywhere else and this one worked great
1,This is my first kindle. I'm not sure how I lived without one now. The screen is excellent. I love being able to read outside (no glare!!) AND in bed (built in light!). Not sure how useful the automatic light adjuster is but it is a neat idea. Maybe as I use it more I will come to appreciate the automatic light adjustment.
1,Much better than the old one it replaced.
1,Love that I do not have to constantly go to the movies and having things at my fingertips works
1,This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!
1,"No question about it this is the best e ink e reader available. Much easier on the eyes for long reading sessions that any tablet, even one with a sharp screen like an iPad Air/Mini or top of the line Samsung."
1,Happy i used for play games is ver y fast At camera
0,I returned the item was not what I expected very disappointed white the table
1,Great tablet for the beginner or young child. would recomend
1,This was my first time being introduced to the Fire Stick TV and it is awesome with all its features and ability to add multiple applications. 2 thumbs Up!!
1,Great price for a tablet. Like the size and looks.
1,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.She loves it, easy to use, speakers are more clear than her other devices Great volume"
1,Got 2 of these for our great grandchildren for Christmas. I know they'll be excited to have their own tablets!
1,This tablet can be summed up in four words.Phenomenal performance/minimal cost
1,"This is a great eBook reader around the house & free WiFi areas ( some McDs, Starbucks, etc. ).Got this as: 1. It's 50 Bucks.2. Doesn't hurt so much if you fall asleep while reading ( doesn't weigh as much as a ""full-size"" tablet ) 3. Fits in my pants pocket so you can take it with you.4. Lots of free books from Amazon.5. Did I mention it's $50.00?"
1,I'm still figuring out what this gaget will do. It's going to be fun finding out.
1,"Excellent product for movies, tv and games. Only hiccup is the remote, wish had more buttons."
0,"If this is your first tablet I would recommend it. If you've ever had an iPad and would stick with the iPad and pay the extra money, even for an older one. ""You get what you pay for""."
1,"not as big as the fire box yet its not that much slower, very satisfied"
1,"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
1,The kindle is a good tablet and would recommend to others
1,"After experimenting for several months with an Echo Dot, I decided to take the plunge when the Echo showed up online at a deep discount. Like the Dot, setup was easy. Sound quality is awesome. Sometimes it works too good as it listens to everything all the time. It‚Äôs going to be fun to use just the same."
1,I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. I recommend it to any parent for a child.
1,This device works as well as all the reviews have claimed. It was so simple to set up and works very well.
1,"It was easy to set up the echo. Works great, still learning what Alexa can do, My wife love it."
1,"Fire TV works even better than the Fire Stick. Very fast, smooth with little to no buffering."
0,Ordering process was easy and as expected. Hopefully my husband will install it soon.
1,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
1,"This speaker puts out some great sounds and has lots of options for connections. And, it is Alexa commandable."
1,"This thing is great, turns my lights on and off, tells me stock market details and even tells me jokes. Couldn't live without it."
0,"The price is something you can't beat... but it can be misleading.Pretty much every function and app required you to buy something, not much you can do for free. But still worth it for such low price."
1,Good product recommend it to everybody very easy to set up
1,Bought 2 for family. They love them. Good Birthday gifts!
1,This is such an awesome product I highly recommend it  very easy to use and capable of so much!
1,It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.
1,perfect size; good graphics; app store is extensive!my parents are not tech savvy and they love this!
0,"Bought five of these for my teachers to take photos/videos and upload to our site and email parents. Does everything just fine, except the cameras aren't the greatest. Pretty slow to capture the pic and they all come out blurry with he slightest amount of motion (from the subject or photograher). Ok product if your not focused on taking pictures."
1,"still have s long way to go but is good for a smart house will love to get her on spanish lol ,need way more .the idea is great the funtions are to but need more to be a 5"
1,This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.!
1,Love my new Kindle. The picture is clear. The camera takes beautiful pictures. Happy with this purchase.
1,"Very easy to set up, took maybe 5 minutes. Quality and Service is great!!"
1,Got this during thanksgiving sale.. had already owned one.. Amazon could improve the UI for better user experience.
1,"We have had a Kindle Fire for years. My wife used it exclusively for reading. She grew frustrated of the constant random reboots and difficulty to see the screen. this device has cured all those issues. Longer battery life, stable hardware, and ease of viewing make this a winner."
1,My daughter loves her tablet and it's great for movies and games!
1,Makes watching Netflix shows at home easy if your tv doesn't have wifi capabilities.
1,"I have tried numerous Media Streaming Devices, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. This particular steamer offers a solid combination of hardware, apps, settings and tweeks, as well as expansion options and upgrades all for a reasonable price. You can obviously stream media from the Internet but you can also play games, stream live TV, watch 4K content, add USB and/or SD storage for expansion and off-line access, connect a USB and/or Bluetooth keyboard/mouse/joystick for enhanced interaction, connect Bluetooth headphones or speaker(s) for added listening options, and more! Unless you're looking for a specific advanced feature or functionality, the Amazon Fire TV provides a solid overall Media Streaming experience!"
1,"What i love about this is that there is no buffering, no commercials and it runs smoothly. Very user friendly and fun to use."
1,For the little price I paid this was a good buy for the kids. I prefer the Amazon tablets for my kids so they can be more involved with reading.
1,It is a little hard to figure out how to put the programs into the Echo bc we are not really super savvy on doing this type of application.
1,I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day. She absolutely loves it. She uses it everyday. Best thing I ever bought for her.
1,The Fire TV is the best device to stream PlayStaion Vue. Its super fast and Alexa is amazing.
1,The size of the Kindle is handy for taking it with you wherever you want to go; is user-friendly and easy on the eyes.
1,"Very convenient, no glare, you can view pdfs, and it does not weigh to much."
1,"I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
1,"New smart tv, sound bar, and AlexaThe Fire brings it all together. Good product !!!"
0,Bought it for my 5 yr old daughter and for some reason it did not work. This is the second time I've purchased this and had to return it. So I will get her a mini iPad. Never again will I waste my time and money.
1,I purchased one of these to tested it out and wound up purchasing too more
1,I love this little tablet. My daughter loves free time app on it. She wants to play on the fire tablet more than her kids Samsung tab
1,Very durable cover Takes the abuse that a 3 year old gives it
0,Got this on Black Friday as a gift. Kids luv it.Touch response is not very smooth
1,Although expensive....is exactly what you would expect.
1,"I love this Kindle, I should have purchased a long time ago!"
1,I am enjoying my Kindle Paperwhite. Its easy to use and I love the backlit format.
1,The stick offers one of the best options if your trying to ween off the cable providers. Great offers
1,I've had the Echo for a couple of weeks now. It's gathers a better grasp of my commands with every use. Little expensive for the add ons but worth it
1,"the new kindle is a good, inexpensive 7"" tablet with nice features and a good easy to use operating system. It is responsive and the screen has a good resolution. 8GB is adequate and the provided SD card slot allows you to increase your storage capacity."
1,They are great! Kids love them! They play all there games.
1,This devise is much faster and easy to use. Highly recommended
1,"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE"
1,Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again
1,I purchased this for my bedroom since I have the stick downstairs close to my Wifi router and have had no issues with it. This is even better than the stick and has no buffering or lag issues whatsoever for the normal things I watch and stream. Highly recommended!
1,works a lot better than the fire stick. love that there is an sd card slot.
1,Bought it as a gift for my daughter as an iPad replacement. Reading without distraction is priceless. Connectivity with local public library makes kindle more valuable.
1,"So far, so good! It's been about 3 weeks or longer since i got it. I use it more than i thought I would. A good reason to justify the $100 for the Amazon Prime Subscription."
1,Finally a woman who listens to me ;) Great sound from the speaker and great voice recognition. My third echo and I'm loving all it can do.
1,"Hey Alexa, Hey Alexa - Night and day it's Hey Alexa. Make the fire, fix the breakfast, Wash the dishes, do the mopping!Ok, so I haven't figured out how to make Alexa clean my house like Cinderella...yet. But I'm working on it. In the meantime, I have figured out that she is much more than a glorified alarm clock or DJ. Although, you should know that alarms are not currently supported on this device, like they are on the Echo. This is a more basic version of Alexa. It doesn't have her full functionality.ABOUT MEI'm not sure what the target demographic for this product is, but I am a professional female in my early thirties, who is in a committed relationship. That is a nice way of saying that my partying days are behind me and my boyfriend and I spend a lot of time binge watching stuff on the sofa. Yes. We are suburban couch potatoes. No shame here. Also, I am an Amazon Prime member, but do not have a 4k TV.I used to have a Roku that I used for Netflix and Hulu. However, I was more interested in free shipping, so I moved to Prime and got a Fire TV Stick when it was offered for 19.99. For me the stick is a glorified HDMl cable. You could get the same benefits by connecting your laptop to your TV. It's less cumbersome, but that's about it. I wanted it because it said it could mirror your device's screen onto your TV. It didn't explain clearly enough that the only device it could do that with was a Kindle (although this has since changed and can now be done). That is why I didn't order the Echo when it came out. It sounded cool but I couldn't figure out what it actually did. Since then, my father got one for my mother, who had a stroke, and it is awesome.Read more"
1,Great price on toothbrush. Been using a couple weeks and see results aready.
1,We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.
1,I love it. IT is programmable and easy to use. The voice command is very nice.
1,"The Echo is a great product, it was easy to set up and Alexa was answering questions in no time. There are several basic functions that the Echo is wonderful at: news, weather, music, time and timing. I love playing the Jeopardy game. I think that if I have anything to say on the ""down side"" it is that I had a higher expectation of the product's ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions. Lots of my inquiries come back with the answer ""I did not understand that question"" or ""I'm sorry, I do not know the answer."" These are only a minor irritation/amusement. Overall, I am pleased with the product. Hopefully I will grow in my knowledge of the product and Echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades."
1,Amazon makes great products. The echo controls my smart home and is easy to use and set up. They're always adding new features and I would recommend it.
1,My new Kindle is working the way it should. No problems advancing pages.
1,"I tried the Amazon Fire TV after trying the Fire Stick, sue to the better ratings on resolution and the ability to hardware my internet connection to it. With these two features, the high definition in no different than what I had with Directv, which solidified this was the right decision. I now have 3 of them in each room of my home."
1,We enjoy our Amazon Echo Alexa. I like being able to just ask a question out loud and receive the answer. If you want to know what the weather is like outside you just ask and she tells you:)
1,She plays any song you want to hear. I am so glad i got it!
1,Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature.
1,I purchased 3 of these at Christmas time for my nieces and nephew and WOW were they pleased! Their Mom & Dads happy also because it freed up their phones & tablets. This is a quality product with a lot of apps for kids and adults alike. Do not hesitate to buy for any age!
1,I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
1,I bought as a gift for my daughter but she also received from another person. However she still enjoyed it.
1,I bought this for my husband whom is in medical school and he loves it! He has his textbooks there and can carry it with him everywhere. Best thing is that is easy on the eyes
1,I purchased this tablet mainly because of the price so I am pleased with the functions that it offers...mainly accessing the internet and games.
1,"I was looking for something inexpensive but with a large enough screen that I could use it to read musical charts off of when I perform and this little tablet has been a great solution for me. The screen is sharp and bright, the wifi picks up fairly weak signal and makes good use of what's available, the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate. It seems built fairly well and for 39$, I'm happy."
1,It's great if you don't download a lot of books. Storage is filled quickly
1,Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
1,I've tried several tv boxes but this one is so far the best
1,If you have Prime this is the device!! Love it. Get yourself one for sure. No prime maybe not so much
0,"...but WiFi isn't working great. I have love Amazon Kindles since my first one, replaced it with a 7"" Fire HD, then got 7"" Fires...multiple ones. Problem is the last 3 work with wifi for a while, then start having problems. Reset wireless modem worked for a while, then hard reset did, now won't work for wifi at all. Will keep trying, though."
1,I would buy this item again. Fast shipping. No hassle.
1,"Great tablet for all ages , nice HD colorLittle difficult for young children"
1,Very easy to use and Alexa is awesome! App store has anything you could want in it too.
1,Another classic from amazon. Would definitely recommend.
0,The tablet is great for reading and watching movies
1,Love this thing. I've had my 4K tv for a while now and now I feel it's complete with the Fire TV. Lots of ways to find and watch 4K content.
1,"I don't consider myself a ""heavy"" reader (I read a couple books every few months), but I love my new Kindle. It's lighter than some of my books, which is great, but the best thing is that I can read at night in bed without disturbing my wife.The e-ink display allows you to also read outside in direct sunlight, perfect for the upcoming summer months. It's relaxing to just go out to a local park, sit under a tree, and read your new book.If I had to find a fault with this Kindle, it would be the ads. You're already paying a decent amount for an e-reader, then if you don't want ads on the lock screen, you have to pay Amazon more money. They don't really bother me, so it's not worth taking away a star. They might bug you though, so just keep that in the back of your mind before buying this that you will have to pay Amazon $20 to have them removed."
1,The list of shows/movies you can watch with this thing is endless. This is a very powerful unit for under a $100. They have a huge selection of app's and games. And you can use your iphone as a remote. I enjoy this unit so much I have one on every tv in my house and they make great gifts.
1,Really cool product want to learn how to use it more
1,Bought for my mom to help her with her hand coordination. She loves it..
1,This is a great reader. It is easy to use and very dependable. This is my third one. Really like them.
1,"I wanted a cheap e-reader that also had tablet capabilities. I mostly use this to check out and read books from the library, but also do other things like read emails, browse the web, etc. It's a great reasonably priced e-reader/tablet. I recommend it."
1,Tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet
0,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
1,Love the new fire tv. I use it everyday to stream tv and movies. Good quality product
1,Nice compact size. White screen makes it easier to read
1,"Great Item, I read in the dark without strain and never disturb my wife's sleep, User friendly and durable. I've not been a reader until now, have several books but it's at night when I have time to read but have to have a light on, This has been the Game Changer. Two Thumbs Up!!!!"
1,"WE LOVE OUR Amazon Echo,works great.I play a lot of music on it."
1,"Lightweight, easy to,use, great battery life. Have increased my reading substantially since getting it. Love the matte background, adjustable text size, and back lighting. So much better than trying to read on an iPad."
1,This tablet is really easy to use and still holds up pretty well. I got this tablet for my grandma for her birthday and she can't put it down!
1,I love the echo! It has great sound. And it hears my commands around the house. It's easy to use. The set up took some time but overall it's great!
1,It's a good tablet for the price although battery is not the best
1,This pairs really well with my Logitech Harmony Elite remote. It's great being able to play music without ever having to touch a device. The feature we use the most is setting timers and playing white noise for night time.
1,I have the echo and echo dot and use them all the time. I highly recommend them.
1,I think it's great and for people who aren't to fimiliar with technology is easy to understand
1,"Amazon did it again, Alexa is awesome and controls my lights, music, can ask her questions and works great with IFTT"
1,"This is my second kindle. As I travel a lot, I love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through Amazon and my local library."
1,I love this kindle so much I decided to by one for my daughter who is going to Europe. She will be able to download books and videos to watch on her long flight!!
1,Bought this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it. Great price as well.
1,"I was initially hesitant to buy the Echo, but I am glad that I did. It is quite convenient and great for music."
1,"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more."
1,Love not paying cable bill. Just wish we could get sling blue.
1,"I wanted to get my daughter one of these for Christmas, and I saw the price and could not pass it up."
1,We bought this for our youngest 2 now our oldest 2 wants one! What's great is the price and you can expand it from 8gb up to 128gb I believe!
1,I have one. It is much faster than your cheap chargers. Much faster. I also use it for my phone. From dead to full charge in less than 45 minutes!
0,so far so good. I order two of these and they are working out great!
1,"This is a great starter tablet. Does all the basic things and is only $50. Not gonna find a better one for this price. In this price range your not gonna find a faster one. Get an SD card and you can put stuff on the card eliminating the one weak point of the tablet, only 8 gig of memory."
1,Was debating between an iPad or kindle for my other half and after the reviews I decided on the kindle since he likes to read. He loves it. The battery life is awesome.
1,"I've had my kindle for a few weeks now and find it very easy to cart around and to read regardless of the lighting situation. I'm not crazy about the constant ads for books in genres I'm not at all interested in, but that's about the only negative I've found so far."
1,Convenient to use. Can take it with you when traveling
1,I purchased this for a child on the angel tree for Christmas.
1,Purchase it for my granddaughter and she love it many great children's app for learning
1,"Works great with my harmony remote, but she is not very smart. Siri works better for most items."
1,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
1,"What a great new ffiend... very responsive ,, have alexa handling all my home automation now too .. great add"
1,Bought this for my dad and he loves it! Light weight and easy to use.
0,Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.
1,i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
1,"This is actually a gift I bought my sister for her big ?? Birthday! I received my echo as a birthday gift from a friend and let me tell you... I LOVE IT!!!It is so sleek and loud and crystal clear! I love waking up and asking Alexa to tell me the weather forecast and news updates. The music sounds awesome too! But let me tell you the ""magic"" of this echo... I had to go to Italy for a family thing and my hubby couldn't take the time off of work so I went without him (sad face)The best way for me to show him how much I missed him was to wake him up with our favorite song! That's right folks I would wake my husband up from 1000's of miles away with a touch of a button on my cell phone!!He sent me a text ""is that you?"" Wow!!! I couldn't believe it.So enough said just go out and buy one!!"
1,I just do know how I can live without my new firestick! It's so easy to use and so much to see because of this!
0,This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me
1,Perfect. Stream tv easy to use remote. Easy to set up
1,"I have both the fire stick and the fire tv, the fire tv is much faster considering the processing power."
1,A nice upgrade from my original Amazon TV Fire.The voice command feature has been flawless.A great purchase.
1,"I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. I have 3 in my house and it is so easy to play music, find information or listen to Audible books. I love when I am cooking and I don't have to use my hands to start listening to music."
1,Super easy to install to your hdmi. Just signup for a Amazon account and you are off to the best streaming experience.
1,The device has provided our family with numerous hours of TV watching without the high monthly costs of cable
1,"Plays almost all the songs I have requested from pandora , some songs were only available from amazon"
1,Great as a streaming music ayer that has other functions. The quality itself of the speaker is great.
1,"I bought it for my wife to use mainly for news, music around the house.I have not tried the other automation features. I was expecting a little better audio sound but it s ok.Again I am using it at about 30% of capability, hence review is incomplete.But enough to give it a 4-star."
0,Got 1 of this when it 1st came out. Returned the unit coz it won't boot up. Advantage buying from Bestbuy easy exchange or return. The second unit that i got works perfectly.
1,I THOUGHT THE TABLET WAS GREAT FOR THE MONEY. DID NOT LIKE HAVING TO GO ONLINE AND PRINT THE DIRECTIONS. DID NOT LIKE HOW TOUCHLY IT WAS.
1,Excited to use the Amazon Fire Box. Very easy to use.
1,"Great tablet for kids and beginners, I would recommend for anyone looking for an easy to use tablet."
1,"Bought a 2 blacks, blue & orange. These tablets are amazing & awesome price"
1,My kids love this tablet! They use it with ease! Great price too!
1,"This is the foundation of how we're going to interact with our home and purchases. It'll only get more integrated. Whether you like this sort of thing or not, the Echo is fun and useful. Love walking into my house and saying, ""Computer, play music from the 90's"" or ""Computer, turn on the lights"". And as more and more skills are continuously added, it'll only get more fun and useful."
1,This was a replacement for my Son as he had one for about 4 years that just got broken .
1,This item works great and fitst anywhere. I have no complaints...
1,I got this for my son so I can read him books and he can play a few games. it is easy to use and i Like how you can setup for it to work kid mode
1,Overall this device is great. No problem with performance and usage. My only fault I think they can advance on is the remote. the current one is nice and sleek but lack the ability to type. Hitting the arrow keys to search for anything is a pin. Second I would add the ability to search for Apps a little more easily. Finally the web browsing is not the best and definitely needs advanced on.
1,Easy to use and books transferred without issue nice screen
1,"This Amazon Fire TV is my second unit in my home. I haven't paid for cable since I bought my first unit a couple years ago. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you should seriously already own one."
1,"Use Echo for so much,music,alarm clock and lights."
1,I bought this for my mom and she has had no problem using it.
1,"Great little tablet, especially for the price! Does everything I need it to do! Only complaint is, you have to reconnect it to WiFi again whenever you turn it off and back on - and sometimes it won't connect to certain ones - possibly due to security settings? Other than that, I love it!"
1,"I haven't had the Echo for very long, so I'll need to spend more time on its capabilities. I've used it primarily for music. Alexa's great at understanding my requests - when they're from Amazon Prime music or music I purchased through Amazon. I've struggled so far with trying to get her to play music from my extensive I-Tunes music - even though I have an IPod Touch paired with the Echo. I'll have to keep trying.I've also used Alexa for setting timers and some basic questions. She's not very good at some questions - especially if they're too long. Anyway, I look forward to playing with Alexa some more. So far, I'm happy with my purchase."
0,I bought this hoping that I could use it for a book reader and other lightweight tasks. The wifi is very slow and the tablet in general is slow and hangs to much
1,"It's no iPad, but it's also dirt cheap. A great rough and tumble tablet."
1,My son uses this to take notes in class and read material related to class. It has helped him by not having to take along extra books to class.
1,If you have a Amazon prime account this will be useful for you instead of using another device.
1,"Bought this for our son. Works great for what we needed it for. Just wish the volume was a little better, but overall good product."
1,The kindle fire works really well for my sone he is learning a lot
1,"It was a gift and can I say, it was a hit. When I go to my daughters house she is always telling Alexa to do something"
1,Love the Kindle. Very useful when traveling outside house to friends.
1,Purchased this as a gift. Waiting for the owner to advise.
1,This Echo takes the place of the small model. Has great sound very pleased with purchase.
1,Echo-Dot is doing the same thing. Just doesn't have the huge speaker.Echo-Dot can be connected to external speakers via blue-tooth or cable (though it's speakers are not bad for voice responses from it)
0,"pretty much you get what you pay for... not bad, but not great, but an inexpensive fix for the cause"
1,"Echo has surprised me in many ways. While the features are nothing new, the ability to access them through pure voice control has been incredible."
1,Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
1,"I have had this tablet for nearly a month now and so far I love it. Is small for portability, it does what I want it and need it to do. I use it to watch movies/series/shows etc from online apps like amazon prime. The price is unbeatable for this tablet. I am def getting my $ worth out of it. Love it would recommend. Makes for a great gift. the camera isnt all that great but I dont use it to take pics at all."
1,"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Playstation Vue. Vue worked on the FireTV Stick and got the job done but when a sale came for the FireTV, I thought why not. Boy, night and day difference in speed of menu transitions and buffering of shows. Everything is just snappier and faster. Going back to a FireTV Stick was so painful because of the lag in menu transitions. If you could afford it, go for the FireTV over the Stick. Also I own a Roku 2 and the FireTV is MUCH more useful because of the ability to sideload apps."
1,Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use.
1,Bought for my kids for Christmas. Great tablet for the price!
1,it was to be a gift but not really liking it for myself but it's ok
1,Fast and easy to use. Interface is user friendly. Even my kids had no issue using this device. No lags for me. Connected wired and seems way faster than the stick. Definitely recommend this item.
1,This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
1,good reliable tablet will recommend to others.not expensive at all.
1,We now have fire TV in every room of the house. Very user friendly.
1,Enjoy using this as much if not more than the Apple TV
1,Just using this for music so it does what I need it to do. Would give 5 stars but it falls asleep faster than I would like it to.
0,"I bought this as a gift for my son and his wife. I rhougjt with having a young baby at home and their hands always full it would come in handy. They liked the idea but after doing their own review search, decided it wasn't for them."
1,"sadly it's lacking youtube, it does do everything else do and does it all great.go here for easy kodi setuphttps://github.com/sphinx02/FireStarter/wiki/Install-FireStarter-and-Kodi-%28only-FireTV-needed%29"
1,I have 3 fire sticks and 2 fire tvs. I liked them so much I gave them as gifts to friends and family.
1,"I use it to control the smart devices. It works well. No problem about discovering the devices. The loudness is more than enough for my living room. Furthermore, it allows the Bluetooth devices to connect to it."
0,"We like the convenience that the echo offers but it seems to fall down on some things. For example, store hours are often not available when asked. Wondering if the Google Home wasn't the way to go."
1,"The fire tv has access to numerous applications. If you're looking to replace cable, this is definitely a first start. If youre not, you still have access to lots of movies, apps, tv shows all in one place. Binge watching in full effect!"
1,For the price this is a great tablet. I've had the Fire HD6 with a better screen but the 7 has a SD slot for more memory. Screen resolution between the two is very similar while viewing movies and tv.
1,My kids love this tablet especially to watch their YouTube videos. Easy to use and has a great feature that dims the screen brightness ( I set the timer to dim b/w 9 pm and 6 am so that if my son watches it in bed it wont keep him awake) Easy to use
1,I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.
1,It is lightweight easy to use and easy to read. I would def recommend.
1,"Wonderful Tablet, Great buy, Easy to carry, I look forward to using this tablet"
1,"Bought this for my mother as a gift. I was concerned she would not use it, but she has loved it."
1,"I'm a Prime member, so this was a no-brainer. Wish you could get the ""pirates"" version like the stock though."
1,"programming Echo is time consuming, I still have not gotten everything programmed that I would like. We don't use it as much as I thought we would either."
1,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. It is a nice size and easy to use, whether he is reading or playing card games."
1,its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.
1,"Echo is really a lot of fun. We use it constantly, to play music we like, for shopping and to do lists and to get answers to quick questions instantly. Really a worthwhile purchase!"
1,My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet.
1,Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
1,Love my Kindle! So when mother table died I brought her this and now I don't get calls all the time to help her figure out where everything is
1,"I would recommend this tablet , I bought a few other tablets for my younger kids same price , the orbo and wimo but unlike those.. This tablet runs super smooth, install all your xbmc's and kodi's .. Great screen very clear, picture seems better than my iphone 6s plus #shrugs"
0,"Fun to use but not fun with the software. I tried forever to get it to recognize my light modules to turn the lamps on and off. I gave up. If they ever fix the software it would be great. Other than that, it is nice to ask Alexa things and play music. Speaker is good. Amazon Echo software needs a lot of improvement."
0,"Serves it's purpose. Pretty neat features, I like it."
1,Amazon FireTV is a great product. I buy a bunch of them for friends and family because they are the way of the future for streaming devices.
1,cant beat this tablet for 50 bucks great present for anyone
1,"A few years back I asked for and received a Kindle for Christmas - LOVED IT. So I bought this one as a gift for a first time tablet user. They are extremely happy, it is simple to use. This is a great little table/ computer that now comes with a regular re-charger. Strongly suggest this table."
1,Puts out a full 1 amp power allowing a faster charge or power supply.
1,Great and easy read especially when outside in the sun.
1,bought for daughter in law and she likes it. she wanted a fire
1,"I bought this for my mother. She loves it. She keeps it in her kitchen to listen to music, news, and audiobooks while she cooks and cleans. She has an Amazon Prime membership, so she has access to their large and diverse music library. She also listens to audiobooks that she's bought on Audible. The Echo can even be used as a timer for cooking!"
1,Easy setup. Loaded with many service/content providers. Some are fee based. Some provide free content. You choose which ones to view from. I only use the free ones. I would say that the quality of the streaming programs definitely depends on the quality/speed of your internet connection. So negotiate the best deal you can get for the fastest service you can afford. BTW... search the net to learn how to set this up with apps that allow you to stream stuff you never thought could be free. Enjoy.
1,This tablet is a great value for the price point. Great functionality and value.
1,"Great companion to any laptop, and an excellent reader+. Amazon Prime membership can enhance the overall ease of use."
1,I love my Echo. Great for music. Great sound and I can listen to any genre of music I like. Does so many things. Incredible!
1,Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
1,Enjoyed my first Amazon Echo. Bought this unit as a gift for my daughter.
1,"I love my new toy. Setup was quick and easy. It plays all my music and my stations I have setup on Pandora. Only negative is that if you ask question about simple things you are mostly likely get a response that not helpful but that what googles for, but It does tell you the weather and what deals they have. All in all I love it."
1,Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it!
1,Functional for what I need. Compact so travels well.
1,"The kindle paper white is a great size and weight. I live in New York so while I'm on the train and can't sit down to read, this kindle offers convenience because you can comfortably hold it in one hand. I was against e-readers at first but after this purchase I definitely appreciate them."
1,"I love the Amazon Paper White Kindle. I can take it anywhere and it's my entire library at my finger tips. I can read at night, in the glaring sun and even in the constant changes of the outdoor light. This is the perfect reader for on the go."
0,"I'm ambivalent about this tablet. It's a great price point and the picture quality is amazing. It's great for watching Netflix. But, you are locked in to only the apps available on Amazon. I can't download my browser if choice or even the google search app. Additionally, the tablet is linked to Amazon, and basically unusable if you don't have a valid Amazon account, I bought an additional tablet for a non Amazon person and they couldn't download any apps."
1,Bought it for Christmas. The picture is great and memory is plenty
1,Got one for my father and niece. The both loved it. My dad was easily able to set it up and use it. He wouldn't put it down.
1,"Many people asked why I was getting an Echo when I had Siri on my iPhone that basically did the same thing.First, you set the Echo up and it is always there in the same spot. No more looking for my phone in the morning, holding it up to my face and asking about the weather and traffic. While I am shaving in the bathroom, I call out and ask about the weather and it tells me it. How convenient is that!"
1,"This is the coolest gadget I've bought, never imagined I would use it as much as I do. Way cool"
1,Bought for wife because I had one. Hers was an older Kindle that was about to fail.
1,My son loved it he was so happy when he opened it up
1,Works as expected. Bought two as a gifts and both love them.
1,"Like it great apps selection.....,................"
1,"I love this little tablet, bought it as a gift for my mom, easy to use, nice clear screen, Amazon apps ready, lots of fun for the price."
1,I like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one has to clear before one gets to the main screen. Other than that the battery lasts a long time and its compact and easy to use.
1,I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.
0,"Purchased and installed item onto Kindle but am still trying to figure out how storage onto new SD card works. I know it is me, but I think I will have to return to store to get someone to show me how to operate."
1,"Black Friday sale $35! Can't beat a Kindle Fire for that price. Functionality resembles Apple products, but still isn't an iPad/iPhone. Great price for the product though! If you don't prefer Apple products, this is something to look at!"
1,"The Amazon Echo is an essential piece of technology to achieve the complete ""SmartHome"" experience. Two thumbs up!"
1,Great size for children and travel! The kids proof case is a must!
1,THE PRICE IS AFFORDABLE FOR ANY BUDGET..GREAT OVERALL TABLET
1,I bought it for my 8 years old sister and it's perfect. Screen is clear and the price was great
1,"I love the tablet and the price was great ,easy to use."
1,Really enjoy the selection of choices fro movies and TV show programs. Being able to view a season at your on pace.
1,Use my Fire TV all the time to watch movies and play games. Sign up for Prime and watch tons of movies for free.
1,"It's a great device it works great, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it doesn't have the same ""google"" search as ok google does"
1,"The Echo is a gateway drug. First, I just wanted a Bluetooth speaker with some novelty features. Then I got smart outlets. Then Hue lights. Now I'm looking at smart locks. Beware ..."
1,The Amazon Echo is great for our family as it allows us to all have prime music playlists and with a simple voice command we can all play our favorite music. Setting up our smart home items was a breeze and telling alexa to set the thermostat temperature and to turn on and off lights is awesome.
1,THIS ITEM IS ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I MADE THIS SEASIN. I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT
1,overalls a great price and good processor for personal use. Great for small children value and size.
1,Love the kindle fire. Great size and price. Fits right into purse.
1,"I have three of these. They're great. But for how far along this product is, there is still a lot it can't do. And some of the things it can do only function after a very specific command. That being said, there is a lot it CAN DO! Especially via third party apps. Yea, some of the skills are useless. But it is worth the money for a smart home purchase."
1,Bought this for my son for occasional use. Was able to download Google Playstore which greatly expands apps availability. No issues with playing games and watching movies. Screen quality is more than acceptable. A solid performer.
1,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
1,"I love to give my friends and family Echo's. Now, I can give them a white one. This is my most favorite gift of all time."
1,My Son loves his Amazon Fire! He brings it everywhere with him!
1,Good working tablet. Just the right size and glad that I am able to add a memory card. Good apps available for this tablet.
1,"Grandson loves his tablet can't put it down play's games,watches his videos."
1,"Great product.""You tube"" how much you can do with this box."
1,Fire TV is faster than the Fire stick. If you can afford the difference it is worth it.
1,"Not only is this for anyone who has a hard time affording an expensive tablet, it is just a great all around great buy. I bought it because Prime allows you to download movies onto the device so that you could watch them on a plane or anywhere you don't have wifi."
0,"Good enough for the price, I guess, but the touchscreen doesn't work in spots"
1,The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.
1,"Loved the original Kindle but after dark, I needed a light source. With the Paperwhite, and the adjustable back light, it is so easy to read anywhere, any time. The variable fonts help when I get tired and need to increase the size of the font for easier reading.I would happily recommend this Kindle Paperwhite to all."
1,Purchased one as gift for my boy works well no issues. Led me to putchase 3 more as xmas gifts.
1,Alexa has become part of our family. We love listening to music with it.
1,"bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier."
1,Much better than the fire stick. Faster more memory never lags.
0,it does not charge any faster than regular charger.
1,I used to constantly look at my phone to check the weather and simple things. Now I can just ask Echo.
0,"4out of the 6kindles I purchased does not work. the date and time will not set properly therfore it is unable to connect to the wifi. contacted amazon, they acknowledged the problem but directed me back to best buy since they have a 30day back return policy on this product. Well I am unable to make it back into the store by the time the return policy is up."
1,Love Alexa. I have 3 echoes now and 2 dots. I haven't played with them a lot but I love them. It's convenient to ask about the weather when you are getting ready for work or going out.
1,I love my Roku but the Amazon Fire TV is the box to own and the price is right.
1,"Got this for my Dad so he can easily check email and have an electronic photo album of the family. Does exactly what we needed it to do. Moved a lot of the standard desktop icons into one folder to reduce clutter. Overall, a good purchase."
0,This is a good tab for the price not a big issue if you break it.
1,"great tablet for the money. I mostly use it for movies. Plan on getting an sd card, storage runs out fast"
1,"Love it, especially the ability to stream Prime Music."
1,Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
1,"We like using the echo for quick answers and for playing mucic. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because while listening to music loudly, it cannot hear your voice to turn down or to stop playing. So you have to manually turn the volume down."
1,Good for teens that use it primarily for gaming/videos
1,The Amazon- Fire Tv is a great tool for streaming. I suggest it to anyone that didn't ha and a Smart TV but wants those options.
1,"I purchased 2 of these for my 4 & 5 year old grandsons as a Christmas present. They loved them! Easy to use, great screens & volume!"
1,I love it. It is the fourth or fifth Kindle I have purchased....first paperwhite.
1,Had the older model that didn't light up... Was always having to get to a lamp. Now I can read anywhere without any worries. The light adjusts as needed. I get lost in my book without any worries. The screen is perfect size with great clarity and easy to travel with.
1,"I have owned several Kindles over the years, and this one is the best yet. The contrast and clarity is improved over the already-good Paperwhite 2. I like the page turn ""buttons"" on the bezel as well."
1,Great product!! Love sound quality. Love being able to control Dish Hopper.
1,"The main criticism/feedback I have about all electronics has to do with batteries. I feel all batteries could be replaceable (& rechargeable, of course). This is not always the case. So, unless electronic recycling is available, feasible & non-damaging to the planet; that's a bit of a blow. I still feel, technology is great &this is no exception. Downloading non-Kindle items is a little more involved; but still possible. I've used &like the feature of downloading my own documents. I've done more reading than I have in many months due to the Kindle. It's easy to read anywhere. Font size &back lighting are adjustable which creates an ideal reading situation, regardless of circumstances. Wasn't sure about the size (6""); after reading 4-5 books; the size is perfect in my hand."
1,Leapfrog is a great learning tool for preschoolers and beyond my grandson loves it
1,"This is the best Kindle yet and I am loving it! For someone who suffers from eye strain but loves to read, the 300 dpi image resolution and the liquid ink technology are beyond compare. Buy it, you won't regret it!!"
1,"This is a great device, with good sound quality. Alexa's voice recognition is very accurate. The biggest problem in my house is fighting over who will talk to her!"
1,"I wish I could just say it is one of my best investment, I love the fact that now I don't have to drag around several of my favorite books I can now have them all in one convenient place the battery life is great my little girl loves that she can play games on it I think it's great I should have gotten more memory though"
1,Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
1,"bought for child , great gift love the item would recommend it"
1,"I had bought my girlfriend a Kindle Fire HD7 for Valentines day. She had never owned a tablet or PC before, and was just a beginner at smart phones. She became a reader gobbling up over 100 books in the last year. This lower cost device compares well in some ways, but the screen on her Fire HD7 is clearly superior. I would buy this again."
1,I'm very happy with this kindle. Is light and easy to carry everywhere. I like to read at nights and this is way better than having a light on.
1,"It's fun being able to ask Alexi questions. There is a lot she can do, but it takes time to figure it out unless you are tech savvy."
0,doesnot work After three weeksÔºåI cannot open it. so sad
1,Love it. Bought this one for my husband. He loves it as much as I love mine.
1,"I gave this to my God child, ahe is 6 , she loves it to deaf"
1,I love it. Alexa she does everything I need it plays music
1,i was very impressed with my Amazon Fire 7 Tablet - very good!!!!
1,"I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!"
1,"This version of the Kindle really does a great job as you read for extended periods. The screen allows you to read in different light levels, including outdoors, but more importantly, if you're in the kitchen and then move into the family room, the screen seems to adjust and really makes it a pleasure to use this new version vs. my older version."
1,Offers much more entertainment Very responsive no buffering time
1,Pros:I got this Kindle for my son to use while traveling. The backlight feature is good for reading at dark places. The device has great battery life as well.Cons:Not as thins as the latest Kindle Voyage. The screen response is just a tad bit slow. Some of the children's e-books on Amazon are not compatible with this device.
1,"While I purchased this item as a gift for my son, it proved to be one of the best choices I could have made. He loves Alexa and the ability to ask her whatever seems to be on his mind. Echo is a wonderful complement to information availability and information technology to better our lives. A great gift and a most useful item."
1,This tablet is a good choice for little kids. It is not very expensive and provide nice features for the price. You can beat this!!!
1,"I purchased this when I cut cable since at the time it was the only device that had a Sony Playstation Vue App. Although Roku added this channel almost immediately after I purchased the Fire TV, the user interface for Vue is better on the Fire TV. Roku has more apps / channels. However, Fire TV is still a decent compliment and the 4K capability makes this a viable option. Speed and performance is good."
1,Alexa is awesome. If you are looking into a smart home this is the only way to go.
1,I absolutely love this little device. I grabbed the audio adapter for it and use it constantly. It works well to say the least.
1,the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
1,The night reading is perfect. This is a big improvement from the previous model.
1,I purchase this for my wife that she can use as an e-reader. You truly enjoys it. She takes it to her book club meetings and she uses it more than her iPad.
1,I bought the Amazon stick and box due to many people telling me how great it was. Well I've had no better experience than getting this and watching as many movies and TV shows as I want for free! Just upgrade your wireless Internet package and you will love it.
1,"This particular Kindle Fire is simply great for the price. I use it basically for reading ebooks and web news, emails, and streaming movies, as well as playing a few electronic games. It is so compact and lightweight that I can take it with me pretty much everywhere. I don't really use the camera feature since I have a much better, professional grade camera."
1,Not really much to say here but it does the job. I'm not use to the Amazon store as I am with the Google store but I can live with it. This was a spur of the moment but where I wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot. And so far it has been my traveling buddy. For the price it is good and does what it should without to many compromises; ( ads) if your not looking for a lot nice stop.
0,"I bought and returned this item. I was hoping to be able to watch different sports games via the internet with the Amazon Fire TV but everything I selected stated it wasn't available. After trying different things for a few days, I figured I wasn't going to get the results I wanted and returned the unit."
1,"My grandson loves it! It's exactly what he needed. I'm very pleased with it, and so is he!"
1,This tablet is well constructed and light weight and is more than I expected. The eReader part of it is the best for reading on a screen because of its blue screen feature.
1,Nice beginner tablet for the little one to start off with!
1,Easy to install and use. The only cable not cut is internet.
1,"Got this for My Mom for downloading books and games, she LOVES it, very easy to set up and use, Great product!!"
1,This has exceeded my expectation. The processor is quick.
1,"I bought this as an upgrade to my old Kindle. The backlighting is great, now my wife does not have to leave the lights on at night to read."
0,Bad performance. Slow device. Not worth buying. Better products are available in this range.
1,"This e reader is very lightweight, holds a charge for days and is easy to use. Be aware that the display is only black and white so books with pictures are not the best on here. Besides that it is great at reducing eye strain and the backlit screen makes for added versatility."
1,"This was actually an impulse purchase, I was out for the weekend and forgot my Kindle so I picked up one of these. It works so much better than you'd expect from a budget tablet, the screen is very responsive to touch and has good color reproduction. Unless your looking at the screen from just a couple inches away the pixels aren't overly distracting and the text is reasonably sharp.This is a device you can carry around and not be too upset if it gets lost or damaged, and it's a good e-reader (and cheaper than the e-paper models, oddly enough.)"
1,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my mom and she liked it a lot.
1,"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
1,"I love being able to download books and read them whenever I want. I carry it in my purse and can read it anytime I'm in a situation where I'm waiting, on the bus, etc. It's much more convenient than carrying a book around. The only thing that I'd improve is making it easier to get the homepage/toolbar to display."
1,this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
1,It's fun to have but you need a lot of extras to get the most out of it. I wasn't really ready to buy the subscriptions (Spotify) and other things you need to get everything out of it but maybe I'll work my way up to it.
0,I recently bought my fourth Kindle. I bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvements the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate. I also do not like the auto correct especially when writing a document. Browsing is quite good but I am a AOL user and Kindle makes it difficult to use. I definitely would like to see some improvement with making it easier to print.
1,Very nice tablet and great for kids and being able to set timeverything limits for children's profiles. My only this is a little different to locate and find apps for downloading without amazon.
1,"This thing is great, I can get all my music, weather, sport scores and more"
1,This tablet does everything that i could ask and the HD display is great. Ready to purchase a second one. My wife loves it so much I need one of my own.
1,I don't think it's the adapter which seems to work fine. I just have to charge my new kindle lots more than the old one. It's probably the new Kindle's problem but I'll charge it with my old power adapter just to see. I charged with my old adapter and it was the same as the new one. So go ahead and buy this adapter
1,"Alexa works better than expected. Recognizes commands but wish it would make an audible nosise whether or not it is able to perform a function. Sometimes it just dead silence. The app can use more features like more favorites mappable locations than just to ""work"". Overall, not bad for being its first model."
1,This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price.
1,"Have enjoyed using the touch screen to operate. The page light adjustment has been very useful, especially when reading in bed with my wife sleeping."
1,The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user.
0,My son had the original kindle fire. It was great! Simple to use. It finally bit the dust. I bought a new one. They made it way to complicated. It is going back. The power button won't turn off. The notification box won't stay off the screen & the apps wont run. They just keep loading.
1,"Google is releasing their competitor to Alexa but so far, the reviews make it sound like it doesn't compete yet. Alexa is a great companion to your Amazing Prime account. You don't have to have Prime but you probably should. It's voice recognition as very impressive and it's list of abilities grows by the week."
1,"Great tablet for kids. The free replacement policy is great as well. Does take a bit of effort to set up, but pretty easy for the kids to use."
1,"Great little device it reacts fast to the remote and is faster than the fire stick, if you thinking about getting one get the fire TV instead of the stick."
1,"I love the Amazon Fire Tablet. It was easy to use, easy to set up and is easy to see and use."
1,I have this and I bought this for the gift of my brother-in-law and I am really glad to see the smile in his face. It works great and it is good for a movie fan.
1,I just love being able to read at night and not worrying I've lost my place if I fall asleep
1,Thank you for the gifts and thank you for the great customer service.
1,Purchased for a gift and she enjoys using it daily.
1,"This is my second PW and my 5th Kindle over the years. I don't know of a better way to consume books. Read on the Kindle, catch up on the iPhone, further on the iPad, and back to the Kindle."
1,Purchased as a gift for my 83 year old mother. It proved to be simple to use. She is very comfortable using the device and the option for large screen print has given her back the joy of reading.
1,"i love the alex. it has made me upgrade my smart house to work with it. i have insteon hub, harmony hub, smartthings hub and now a philps hue hub. they all work over voice with alexa. i even got 2 amazon tv sticks and 1 tv unit. all working together. love it"
0,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype."
1,"I absolutely love this tablet! I love the price compared to other tablets on the market. Plus the display looks great! At first I was a bit skeptical about how it ran, or if it was any good, but I actually read a personal review about The Amazon Fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it. The article was very helpful to me -- if you want to check it out yourself you can read it here http://www.quikrev.com/fire-tablet-7-display-wi-fi-8-gb-includes-special-offers-black/"
1,If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...
1,Could be a little smarter and they stopped including the remote with it u gotta buy that extra before it was free
1,"I saved $85 per month on my cable bill using the Amazon fire TV. And even though I signed up for Amazon prime, Netflix, and sling TV, I still saved $40 per month and have 10 times as much content and choices. I love it! ( I also recommend using Plex media server to stream all your content directly from your computers to your big screen TV. It's free! )"
1,"Such an awesome product. Helps me organize my life, my own personal assistant."
1,Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren't so good but usable. Apps load quick.
1,It's very good for the price. No problems with the product
1,The Amazon Fire offers the same access to online resources as the much more expensive IPad and functions just as well.
1,Works with a lot of different brands and is easy to set up.
1,"I had a Kindle before and then for reasons unfathomable to me, the Kindle seemed to erase everything when I had unexpected trouble logging in with my password. That was the end of the Kindle. Then I splurged on a Fire and bam, everything came back even better than before."
1,Love being able to have and use. Really wanted it.
0,"Works great as a reader, OK for apps. Battery lasts ages while reading, but dies quickly if I am gaming."
1,I've been using this box as a replacement for cutting the cord w cable. I have no regrets. I stream everything from live tv to catching up w tv series and/or movies. Easy to use interface. I hated the remote though and got a remote w a keyboard on it. Works awesome!
1,"The movie I got was a good one, and I always buy my movies at Best Buy. They are the best places to go buy movies. And other electronics."
1,This is a great toy for now I am just learning the infinite number of things I can do with Echo.
1,Bought it for my nephew for an upgrade and he enjoyed it more.
0,"I bought this product for my three-year-old son. The operating system is slightly complicated unlike the user-friendly iPad. Fortunately, it serves it's purpose as there are many books, apps, and movies fingertips."
1,This is very easy to read and use. The light weight is perfect.
1,Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!
1,"I'm very pleased with my Kindle fire. I've used it more than I thought I would, as I primarily was getting it for reading, but wanted the internet access and ability to review and edit documents, too. In addition to reading more lately than I usually do, I'm also turning my Fire on instead of my desk top computer if I'm only going to use it a short time."
1,My child loves playing with the Kindle fire. It is entertaining and educational.
1,"Would encourage others to purchase if they are avid readers, can go anywhere"
1,Any Alexa speaker is a great investment but this one to me is the best. Works as a stand alone speaker but can also be plugged into things such as sound bars. Easy to set up
1,Bought this nice kindle fire kids tablet for my 18 month son for a 6 hour road trip to LA and it did the job. I downloaded some movies and apps from Amazon to keep the little guy busy. He absolutely loved it and best thing is the case it's very durable. Plus with 2 year guarantee if anything happens they'll replace it for free. We both love it!
1,Love my Alexa so much. Best Gadget ever. Very accurate. Can't get enough of Alexa. Love it so much I got the dot as well.
1,"This is probably one of the best boxes out there. Unfortunately they changed the new model. The white indicator light does not stay on, to let you know the device is on. Did this in the previous model. The power cord is extremely short should be an other foot longer.Changes they made were not for the better but the device produces excellent 1080 p picture"
1,I love my echo and have gotten 4 more for family best thing ever
1,I give these tablets away for prizes in our redemption store. Always sell out and a great value.
1,I recently cut cable. This device has all of the apps I want to stream. It has a fast processor and the voice remote works great.
1,Love my Echo! I use for many things. Bought a battery for it so she goes everywhere.
1,I bought the Fire TV strictly for Playstation Vue and Netflix...worth every penny.
1,Great battery life. Very easy to read in all light. Lots of free books also!
1,My first attempt at kindle. It is nice. Not a very quick processor but gets the job done
1,"I like the Echo, but after I heard about Google home I am considering returning this one to try Google Home. For less money, and more capabilities, I think the Google Home may be a better choice."
1,I bought this for an employee of mine. She loves it. It is light compact and allows her to carry tons of books with her. She is huge book reader so this is a must for anyone that is a big reader. She always thinks it is really easy to read also with the white background.
1,Gift for my wife. She likes it a lot. very happy with it. Thinks it is better than the Samsung she was using. Great buy for the money.
1,My Dad loved it for his Fathers Day gift from all his sons.
1,Perfect tablet for the price. Easy to use good sound. We gave it to our 4yr old for his tablet.
1,"Well built. Easy to set up. I was unsure about this product before purchasing. Alexa better than Siri. When paired with WeMo products, very useful."
1,Very easy to use. Great for daylight reading. Get the. Optional cover for hand feel satisfaction
1,Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading.
1,Great item for someone looking to cut the cord. The selections are endless.
1,Excellent product. KINDLE/Amazon has an extensive library of books to choose from. Love the Back light. Light weight and excellent for travel when you don't want the weight of books but want your books to read.
1,I had the fire stick and the fire Tv is so much better.
0,"We started out great. We had a great thing going. I loved her, she was easy on the eyes, and looked great in any light. Then 7 months into it, I could no longer turn her on. I tried the reboot with no luck. She is still under warranty but that doesn't matter because Best Buy's return policy stinks. If I do try to replace her, I will not buy it here."
0,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-("
0,Good FireTV but remote is buggy. Other than that its a FireTV.
1,My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.
1,"Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go."
1,Great product for security home system. Easy set up and usage.
1,"Good for gift, inexpensive and functional. A bit larger than my Note 5."
1,Is limited. Does not play your own playlist? Is ok.
1,"Purchased this after extensive research between the Echo and the Google home. I must say that this is surprisingly handy. Weather updates in the morning and news headlines read back to me is pretty cool. The echo is very expandable with all the skills you can download to it to make it even better with its knowledge. There are some things that the Google Home does better as far as its answering (Google's search vs Bing) some questions and it's better at interacting with the person speaking, but I feel that Amazon will be learning to do the same thing with their future updates."
1,Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could've been better if there was a mirroring capability.
1,Great product for those that have service from different apps and devices. Here one can access many in one device with ease of setup.
1,"Very nice little reader. Handy, convenient, easy to take along. Able to read in almost any light."
1,Exactly what I was looking for inexpensive and great for my little one. User friendly.
1,Combining this with Amazon prime made this an excellent choice for my 1st grader. They have so many free books and learning games.
1,Great addition to my Home entertainment system. Would recommend.
1,Santa brought it for our our grandson. We got a shock case for it and he plays and watches kids videos on it every day while his older siblings are playing games on theirs. It was a little money well spent on a kids tablet.
1,"This is a neat device. It wasn't something I really thought I needed, but the family thinks it's pretty neat!"
1,I love the kindle fire. This is my second-- I wore the first one out! I got it to read books and love that I can pack all my favorite books to go all in one small tablet! No more box of books to go camping! Also the larger print is easier on my eyes and if I fall asleep ot shuts itself off.
1,Great simple tablet for younger children to use...
1,Actually love the comfort of get answers with few words. Some time it get's confused so make sure there is no background noice. There are so many features I love.
1,good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas
1,"Great product to have in your home , very easy to use."
1,"Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
0,I WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET IT TO SEND PLAY MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE APP. IT WOULD ONLY PLAY SAMPLES OF MUSIC FROM AMAZON.
1,"Music, lights, jokes, news---Alexa does it all. Caution though, once you buy Alexa you may begin to spend more money on add-ons such as controlled lights."
1,"Excellent product focusing on only plain e-readable material, with simple options to operate, no much fancy but worth a million in terms of product worthiness to keep a lot more documents with less memory and has basic internet connectivity option available. Happy experience with Paperwhite Kindle..."
1,This was gift for my step son. It is easy to use and set up.
1,"This is my 2nd purchase of this tablet! But for positive reasons I bought one and had to buy one for my daughter also she loves it, the apps the games and music work fine with and without wifi!"
1,This is my secondvAlexa. One at home one at beach. Great for playing music without searching for stations.
1,Better than Fire TV. Some Major tv msnufactures have built un apps where amazon prime can be added n/c.
1,Fire tv tablet has great apps and are easy to function
1,I've had this for 2 months and I'm still learning. This is capable for doing so much. My wife who isn't into electronics loves this. I can't wait until the Echo can control my Sonos speakers.
1,I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use.
1,"Fast streaming, easy setup. Does provide biased options to push Amazon products, however. Great product overall"
1,Download is slow but after its on the tablet. It works great good buy
1,"This would be a great tablet even if it were $100. Picking it up on Black Friday was literally a no-brainer. I saw it, looked at the price, picked it up and bought it. It is great for all age users. Not great for graphically intense games, but if you want that you need to pay for it. For a casual, everyday tablet (also great for watching movies on the go) you can't beat it."
1,Bought this for my 8 year old. He loves it and it's very simple to add the perfect parental controls!
1,"With knowing not much about Amazon (since I don't use the website much), this is a great first tablet. Easy to use and navigate."
1,"Great for the price.. Good for gifting, if you don't want to spend too much :)"
1,It does just what I need it to do! Easy to take on the go!
1,How can you beat a good android based tablet under $100? By making it an Amazon tablet. Great product works great will be using this for years.
0,I bought the Fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. Went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered. Couldn't even download free kids apps. Why would I want my child able to accidently buy something? I refused and thus not able to download anything. We will be returning it. Product appears best for an adult who likes to read books on tablet.
1,Excellent for someone who is alone at home and needs company. Very entertaining.
0,This is useless. I have tried to calibrate it to my smart home. Pointless.
1,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
1,"Great product. Very informative for those individuals on the go who need quick responses to everyday things such as the weather, traffic, etc."
1,"Easy on the eyes for night time reading. Is a little slow, lags a little. Otherwise great."
1,I was pleasantly surprised about easy was to set up to the WiFi and use. I use it to play music but very helpful when setting up appointments and reminders.
1,Simple and easy to navigate. Smooth screen with no buffering.
1,It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
1,The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it.
1,Love my kindle fire. Great size for reading. Battery long lasting.
1,"I purchased this reader for my wife who is constantly reading. My wife currently has a Kindle Fire HD 7"" which she loves, but it is not the best for reading poolside where there is a lot of sunlight. I wanted to get her something that was easier to read in direct sunlight so she could enjoy her relaxing time even more."
1,Purchased as a gift and the owner loves the functionality and size of the tablet.
1,I enjoy the games and Internet access on the Amazon tablet.
1,"This is a great product. But, may not be worth the extra money. You can likely get away with buying the Fire Stick."
1,Great Item...lots of fun .HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
1,"I had a first-generation one and still in good shape. I purchased this new one mainly because of its updated OS 5. It seems also lighter. The performance is quite satisfactory. The SD feature is an important upgraded feature to the previous model. The only drawback is its over-simplified wrapping, even simpler than most low-end smart phones."
1,My husband wanted this so he bought it. We've had it for about 2 months now and I don't really see a huge need for it. It was fun at first but I find that nobody really uses it much now. Maybe if I took the time to research I may find it more interesting
1,I own 4 of these.Great learning experience for kids. Also great for me as well...all in one gadget!! Everyone in the family is satisfied
1,As always amazon delivers.. LOL On par with apple TV. Great product.
1,We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
1,easy to use - easy to hold while reading lighter than my first kindell
1,Love it. Gave this one as a gift for my mom. She's having a time with it.
1,Great buy for the price on Black Friday!!! My Daughter will be happy!
1,"Perfect for me. With Prime membership purchase this becomes indispensable. Always have video, games, and instant backup for documents to cloud, cheap enough to be almost disposable, no worries!"
1,"So awesome and cool, the future is here!! I can't wait to have her run mu house lights!"
1,My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.
1,Easy to setup and easy to use. It was a gift and my husband loves it
1,MY STUDENTS ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT FOR LEARNING .
1,The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.
1,Great item can't wait to add on and join amizon prine
1,"Could not say more great things about this product!!! Do yourself a favor and get this! It's so fast and while it has the same functionality as the Firesticks which I also own, you can hook this up directly to your internet router which makes streaming extremely fast!!! Make sure you watch plenty of YouTube videos and anyone can figure out how to get the MOST ;) out of all of the services Fire TV, the World Wide Web, and KODI (YouTube this) has to offer!!!!"
1,"I love this Echo. I can get football schedules and scores in a matter of seconds! I also use it to stream my SiriusXM radio, play relaxing meditations and music, and play games. I even had it sing ""Happy Birthday"" to my mom. Definitely a great purchase."
1,I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.
1,"Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year."
1,"Perfect! Perfect screen size, fast, and picture is beautiful! I love it."
1,My mom loves it! She uses it everyday for everyday us and to video char
1,Not a bad bargain. Excedes my expectation! Dont let the price make you doubt it. Runs smoothly on any app and the battery life is OK.
1,I like the ease of setup and the apps available in fire tv.
1,Purchased after theft in Seattle. It was on sale and works great.
1,The Amazon Tablets are the best out there and at the best prices. Full tablet functionality and access to all the Amazon media. Can't lose with these tablets.
1,"The most benefit of the kindle is it just could read, hence, i often use it and put my phone away. the white one is so beautiful!"
1,i am glad i got them for my grand children they r enjoying them
1,great tablet does it all you don't have to break the bank on an expensive one this is perfect
1,"I love my kindle fire. They are a great compact device that can do so much. I can read books for free, play a game and look up answers to my kids questions so quickly!"
1,Great tablet for the money just wish they would add Bluetooth.
1,I love my Alexa product! I ask it to play many genres of music and never cease to be amazed at the selection it plays. I also have it connected to lamps in my house and can ask it to turn them on and off.
1,"I was looking for a good speaker for my wife that was easy. This is a good speaker and could not be easier once set-up. Set up is the only reason for not giving it a 5. Initial set-up is easy, but getting skills and some music with separate log ins was a little confusing."
1,I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.
1,Fire TV provides good quality picture and great remote control.
1,Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen
1,"This is a fun thing and very useful. We are still getting used to it. Love asking it to tell me what weather forecast is, news, Who won baseball game last night, etc. Great for music. Just say ""Alexa, play some Italian Dinner music or whatever""."
1,I recently purchased this product for my nephew for his birthday he loves it and you can set parental setting to block unwanted content.
1,"Don't know what took me so long to try this out. Easy set up, many skills to choose from and has not failed me. I just set the calendar up and loving that along with how well Alexa integrated with my two WEMO mini plugs. I purchased a second one a week later. The sound is amazing."
1,I purchased this item to cancel my cable tv and use PlayStation Vue for the television channels like SyFy and others. The network connection allows the use the high speed internet without bogging done the Wifi. The only issue I have encountered is the remote can be laggy but it has less lag that the fire tv stick remotes.
1,A very smart device that keeps you entertained and helps you learn new things.
1,Set up was a breeze- we are constantly enjoying the music with great speaker quality- lots of apps to use
1,Just got the echo last month and I just love it. I plan on getting another one soon and would recommend it to anyone.
1,This Tablet is awesome and so Powerful and easy to use
1,what to say - works
1,I initially read e-books on my old Kindle that needed a light. I then migrated to using my mini iPad with a kindle app. The brightness bothered my eyes and outside it was pretty useless. I bought the paper white as it has a backlight that isn't too strong. Love it!
1,This is one of the most powerful streaming device in market. Kodi runs super smooth on this and not to mention the great features that come along with Amazon prime membership
1,Absolutely love my Echo. My home is always filled with music. I even bought another for upstairs.
1,Bought this for my girlfriend's son and he absolutely loves it. Just about every person I talk to who owns one falls in love with it. Highly recommended.
1,Really nice tablet full of content when using Amazon prime account. Great gift for any holiday or birthday
1,I bought this Amazon Fire for a Christmas gift during the Black Friday sale. Great product for the price offered!!
1,SIRI who is all I have to say. ALEXA is now my go to AI
1,This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
1,Great tablet for my grandkids ranging from 6 years old to 10
1,"I wanted to buy the kids edition but it cost a little more, so I decided to go with this one and it turns out to be exactly what I need. I am not sure but I think the only difference is the rubber case."
1,"I bought two of these - one for each of my kids. Though they aren't super powerful devices, the price point is a perfect trade-off for the little ones. Now they each have something they can spend their screen time on, and they are wonderful for trips. The software is a bit clunky, but overall, a great device for $50."
1,Great camera for a beginner very easy to understand
1,I buy kindle fires for my grandchildren. They are between the ages of 6 to 10 years old. They seem kid friendly and easy to use.
1,I had a fire stick and decided to upgrade this so I can connect my internet straight to it and get higher speeds. It runs fast less buggy and I plan on buying another for upstairs bedroom.
1,Great item for Great price. Functions as expected.
1,Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.
1,"I purchased this device as a dedicated reader with the occasional web browsing and video streaming and I am very happy with it for that purpose. It is the right size and the right weight. The Amazon case (sold separately) gives it a real book feel. If you are looking for more multi-purpose use, you may find this device frustrating - especially if you have invested in Google's ecosystem. The device runs on Fire OS - Amazon's flavor of Android - and app purchases are made through Amazon's app store. Google Play store and Google Services are not available on this device, and the most essential Google apps (e.g. YouTube) are not available in Amazon's app store. That said, it's still an excellent device for this price point."
1,I bought this to keep up with my email while my computer being repaired . the computer is fixed and still use this more than the computer. Love it!
1,"We are still learning about Alexa's functions, but already love her! We are very amused that you can ask her to tell you a joke. :) Super excited to learn all that she can do."
1,Not a bad tablet for the price. Watch movies and browse internet.
1,this tablet is the best buy i could buy . i paided $33.00 dollars for a brand new kindle fire !!!! Awesome!!!!
1,"I really like the Amazon Echo. It gives me information w/o my having to log online. Alexa's voice is clear and the information concise. I like the sleek look & the blue ""ring"" that allows you to know when you have connected with Alexa. There have been quite a few questions she cannot answer. Hopefully as we become used to the Echo and how to phrase questions our luck will improve."
1,"I purchased for my grandchildren and they work fine for watching Netflix or Amazon movies, however, Kindle offers no app for YouTube which is a somewhat of a drawback for kids. Nice to access books for kids to encourage reading. Also like the parental controls so kids can't make a purchase without your knowledge."
1,Works great even from a different room it responds and when I play music the sound is very rich
0,"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."
1,Bought for my wife to be able to read outside. She love it and uses it all the time over her first generation kindle fire. Does not glare when using outside
1,"I find the Alexa educational, fun, entertaining and convenient. I say convenient because I love that I can ask the time without looking elsewhere. Whether it's the middle of the night or while getting ready for work. There are so many types of questions Alexa can answer!"
1,Staff. Courteous and knowledgeable. Would recommend store any time. Awesome sales
1,"Great tablet for my 6, 7 and 9 year old's. It's very easy for them to use with the 'Free Time' mode. I love Amazon and love that I can switch between different user profile no matter which tablet I'm using. Definitely recommend to others with children. Only downfall is some of the apps I use that are on either googleplay and itunes are not available in the Amazon appstore and it does not have bluetooth. But overall it is excellent for my children and the price was amazing!!!!"
1,Good picture and sound quality. Handy size. Meets my needs and then some.
1,"Durable and inexpensive. Just bought two to replace my kids' fires that were over 4 and 2 years old, respectively."
1,"I like it, my kids and my wife liked it, 1000 of programs and apps"
1,"It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!"
1,Its ok but the chargers brake easily but overall its the best
1,"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
1,"I recently purchased this item for various reasons and so far it meets my expectations. However, I did have an issue with the voice volume on the video why flying for 5 hours."
1,"I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
1,Works as advertised very happy with my purchase controls my Hue Philips lights my light strip
1,Our entire family is enjoying the addition of Alexa to our home. It is extremely easy to set up - and makes searching for information and playing music just a few words away. Amazing technology!
1,Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure
1,"Quality product, easy setup and all of the features you need ; )"
1,The Echo has awesome sound and is super fast. We love it!
0,"Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it."
1,If you're a movie nutt and want to save on cable..
1,Works great as a small tablet for my niece. she watches movies and read books. It's perfect!
1,Had it for about year and would say it had good voice recognition and sound quality. Seemed to be functional and worked really well.
1,"Works great, good battery I wish it was a little bigger but I loved the $50 price! Completely worth it"
1,This has been a great addition to my media collection. Youtube in 4k looks awesome!
1,I received this as a gift and love it. It can do so many things I have to give it a 9/10!
1,Runs smoother then the fire stick. Love the idea of picking and paying for only the channels I want.
1,Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
1,The Amazon Echo has been a fun edition to our home electronics. I like playing Jeopardy everyday. Listening to music. The speaker has a great sound. A handy item to have around.
1,"Love that I can get answers to history questions, But especially love the fact that it plays any song that I ask of it."
1,"This is a great addition to any technological home. We don't use it all the time but we use it daily. It has a hard time recognizing my location when we ask for the weather, but we can ask for our city weather and we get it. We use the note taking quiet frequently for calling out what we need for groceries. It plays music that we ask. Now we must get some of the switches and plugs for controlling your lights and home automation. That will be a while, but it is still cool to know it is there as an option. Overall this is a cool toy for the whole family."
1,Got this little gem for a family member for Christmas. She travels a lot and this works perfectly for her on the plane. Screen quality is pretty good. Not high def but good. My niece loves her new tablet.
1,"I had bought a 4K TV and wanted to view some 4k content so got this. I found some 4K demos on Youtube and I was amazed at how good the picture quality was. In addition to watching Prime videos, I also watch SlingTV which seemed to work fine during the little time I used it. Setup was simple and it was up and running in no time."
1,This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
1,"Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it."
1,I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
1,Alexa can answer most of our questions. Great for kids who love asking questions and for grown ups as well.
1,I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
1,At first I had Amazon Fire stick but I had too many problems with the screen freezing. Having some memory solved the problem. My router is in the basement 2 floors down. My only gripe is I haven't found a way to organize apps or shows like Apple TV. Got this so I could get PS Vue. Now I have programming I like in addition to Amazon Prime programming. I do get concerned with the possible data usage fees that major internet providers keep trying to impose. Otherwise I'm happy with the device.
1,I got it because it is very helpful. Just by calling her name and on top of that ANYTHING you ask her she has the answer. It's like always having someone to talk to. I love my Amazon Echo!
1,How can you not love it? It provides convenience. It works great to borrow books from the public library. Just imagine all the savings on hardbound books.
1,The echo provides great sounds paired with Alexa makes it a great buy.
0,Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.
1,Had to buy Sims cards for more storage but good choice for kids
1,I thought this was simply just a speaker. I brought it for that purpose and discovered it does so much more. Alexa does wonders. It is a great product to buy and you will enjoy.
1,"The Fire is performing everything I would wish for in a tablet. Browser is working fine, and I enjoy reading on it."
1,"I did my research, and this was the tablet I wanted. It was a smooth transaction. The only thing was that I couldn't purchase it ""without special offers"" from anywhere other than Amazon direct. I opted to purchase it from Best Buy ""with special offers"" because of the price. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could choose to have the ""special offers"" removed after purchase. I had to pay additionally for this option, but it could be done. None of the reviews I read mentioned that this was possible. I suppose this could change this at any time, but at the time I am writing this, it is an option.I saved delivery time by purchasing at Best Buy and paid minimally later to have the special offers removed."
0,The Tablet is good for Kid's Basic use to watch Videos and play few games. Touch should be improved.
1,"I love, love, love my Echo; so much so, that we purchased a second one for the basement the next day. Alexa is awesome! She is intelligent, smart and actually has a sense of humour. She converts Fahrenheit to Celsius, and can perforrm simple Mathematical calculations. She saves me time by not having to look it up on my smartphone. And of course, once you set up Pandora, you can ask her to play songs by your favourite artist. Go Alexa!"
1,"Easy to use, fast response.The display with light is a big plus."
1,"Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service"
1,This was a gift for an employee. He likes it very much.
1,Wish I had ordered another one so that I would not have to change it from room to room
1,Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!!
1,Love this device and went on to buy 2 as gifts! Hope they love it as much as I do!
1,This little treasure was found on Black Friday. Just what I needed as I had lost my old one. Great resolution on videos and easy on eyes for reading.
1,This is one of the best devices out right now! I love it!
1,Great for streaming media and other online things. No lag since you can connect it with a cord instead of over Wi-Fi if you are having lag issues.
1,"My kids were very excited to open this e-reader on Christmas morning. They both started looking up books etc. Very easy to use, small enough to stick in your purse/bag but big enough to read like a book. Very happy with this purchase."
1,My first real tablet. It works awesome for books and playing movies. Even though it is limited to only amazon apps it is fast and has a lot of free apps to play with. If your looking for a tablet to use for mostly internet I would look else where. It is limited to only one browser app that and the music play pack through headphones is kind of weak at least for my taste. Movies look & play great which is one of the things I wanted it for. Good battery life and overall quality. So for the price this is hard to beat.
1,This was a gift for a senior citizen that is not a fan of computers and technology. After just a few minutes of instruction she picked right up on how much fun she could have with her down loaded games and she also learned how to reach out on the internet for information on subjects that interest her. She is very happy with her gift!
1,Amazing deal. Good product. I am satisfied........
1,"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
1,"Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it. Works well, is very user friendly even for a 10 year old and was priced as what I feel was a very good value. I would recommend."
1,"I bought both the dot and full sized echo, this has incredible sound! It is also very handy for checking the weather/morning commute and using it in the kitchen (timers, recipes, etc)"
1,"I thought i wanted, but not sure as didn't know who had 1. Found out neighbor did - & saw how much easier it made things - no more note pads, can tell it to remind me about things etc. Perfect for my schedule"
1,"I use it for lots of games, books , etc and love it"
1,"I love my Echo. I also got a couple of Echo dots to go with it. I have one in almost every room. It is a great wireless speaker, it is a great home automation system. I think Amazon is far ahead of the others this time.I am using my Echo to listen to music, news, get traffic reports, get weather reports, check my calendar, set alarms, timers. I use Alexa to control my smart lights, smart blinds, alarm system, smart thermostats,... I can control almost all my smart devices using Echo and Alexa. I think one area of improvement would be to have Echo/Alexa to act on triggers that connected smart devices generate."
1,Like the hardware. Both box and the remote control is very aethetic and nice to use. processor is fastest by the time I bouth it and still fast enough for my system. Liked that I could install android apps.I wish they implemented NTFS for the microSD card file system. It is limited to FAT32 that limits a file size less thn 4GB. No power off switch is another bummer. But overall I chose this over Roku 3 (or even 4).
0,My daughter has had this tablet for almost 2 months and it works well.
1,Bought this as a Xmas gift for my 5 yr old grandson. He really loves it. I think the charger could use a longer cord though. He plays PBS Kids games and it really burns the battery down quick.
1,It really does almost anything i would recommend it to anybody
1,"Got this tablet as a gift for my mom, who is 72 and is a little not used to high technology, so she uses this tablet mostly for Facebook and reading an e-book. Works fine, but if you are an user that likes high resolution screen, plenty of storage and fast processor, this is not your choice.Good streaming can be done though."
1,The Amazon Kindle is the best tablet on the market!
1,I love the Kindle Paperwhite. I have a Kindle reader without paperwhite and love it. A friend has the paperwhite and recommended it. I purchased it before a trip to the beach and love it. I could read my other Kindle in the sun but not in low light. The paperwhite is great in both situations. I would highly recommend this product.
1,"I have implemented several smart devices throughout our home like Nest thermostats, a Sonos controller, WeMo switches, a Dropcam HD camera and a Ring doorbell. The Echo is quickly becoming the smart hub to control many of these devices. Setup was quick and easy. Integration with my Pandora and Spotify accounts was a breeze. Now I just need to patiently wait for my Echo to beginning offering Sonos control."
1,"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
1,Love my fire!! Easy to download books and is a great tablet for being so small. Price is right too.
1,I rate 10 of 10 for price paid vs product quality.
1,Good tablet for the price. Doesn't have great Wi-Fi capabilities but great tablet for on the go and for kids. The 128 MB expansion slot was the selling point. Very happy with it.
1,"Very good. Protective, sturdy, will stand up on its own. A bit bulky and the cover doesn't stay straight on the front as it's only held on by a magnet. Just a personal preference, but in my bag the front part of the cover will slide crooked or off occasionally."
1,Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it.
1,By far the best media box out there . Absolutely no complaints . Does it intended job with an easy interface
1,A device that gets used to how you speak and follows your commands. The thing has a bit of personality and becomes fun to use.
1,"This is great tablet for reading purpose. Easy to download, surf and read the desired books with great text quality. On top of that, it comes with affordable price."
1,im an avid reader. this device it fantastic. sure beats carrying a book around.
1,Being a newby at this internet stuff is easier after the first 30 days of free trial. Has been down once via the company still working on issues.
1,purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
1,"Solid device. Easy install, remote work great. I would recommend."
1,It hasnt given me any problems much better than the last one i purchased love amazon
1,Wonderful addition to the house. Fun to explore the uses.
0,"Overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. It's simple, elegant and slick. When I say slick, I don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, I mean slippery. The smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. I have a tendency to hold things lightly, so I can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive. I don't understand why Amazon is charging so much considering they'll be offering another cover with additional functionality for half the price (AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Touch, Kindle (Black)). What the heckPros:PrettyFunctionalCons:SlipperyExpensive"
0,"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet."
1,Best tablet hands down for kids! Great parental controls and content selection is awesome with Amazon Freetime!
1,This is awesome. This item was a gift for my elderly father in law who isn't too tech savvy. Didn't want to spend the big bucks with an iPad so this was a great alternative!
1,"I looked into many reviews before buyin this device bec I wasn't convince at first, twas initially offered by Amazon for $199 then with Prime for $99 but missed all those deals bec it was a newcomer in the gadget arena so I waited for awhile but should've grab it when it was launched bec Alexa is just amazing and makes u a bit of a master by his good capture voice commands, ask anything and it will answer the best way it can, maximize with Prime membership and u have a great music entertainment! Great Buy!!"
1,Exactly like my friends. I love it. I took it on vacation and great to read on the beach or at home
1,Perfect Tablet for my grandkids. Easy for them to use as the parent can set up controls on this tablet. ABC Mouse can be downloaded for preschool kids which is a plus. Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas
1,Perfect tablet for beginners. Simple to use great color and perfect size.
1,Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.
1,Very easy to use and cheap for its price. I would recommend.
0,"The Amazon Fire reminds me of a cheap older Android tablet from 5 years ago. The camera is horrible, the screen is full and I'd rather play with fire than to use the, Amazon Fire. Im returning ASAP!"
0,This tablet is very small and efficient. My daughter just loves it... I can say it's basic beginner savvy.
1,"I bought this to compliment the Sharp 4K 50"" I had brought from Best Buy about two months ago.We the 4K content does not show up, you have to search for it on Netflix and Amazon Video. Once you find it however it is beautiful."
1,Love the kindlefire...but don't like the operating system....needs to be more like Android
1,Wife loves this Kindle as opposed to some of the others due to readability in bright light.
1,A real nice tablet for children and got it on sale at Bestbuy
1,"The fire tablet is a very nice tablet. Good memory, and a nice HD screen. Would recommend! Most definitely :)"
1,we have had kindle for a while in our family so it just seemed natural to stick with it for my grandson's birthday gift.
1,"The Voyage is my first eReader and I am not disappointed. It is light, clear and a joy to use"
1,This is a great product if you have kids the apps and kids stuff is great
1,I would recommend this streaming device for anyone trying to cut cords and save money.
1,"I've had a Roku and Apple TV, and also used an XBox One to access services such as Netflix. The Amazon Fire is the best I've used so far. Simple, clean, attractive interface. Very responsive. Since I'm an Amazon Prime member it made sense to look at this when it was time to upgrade. Love it."
1,"The old one wouldn't hold a charge, but my new one goes days before running out of juice"
1,"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
1,came on time and this is a good product
1,Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email.
1,"Excellent and affordable product. It came as advertised. Not top of the line, but not at the end of the line. More than a fair product. Good and fast.Can handle almost all thrown at it. Resolution is passable."
1,Bought two of these for our kids and they are loving them. Great value for the price.
1,I purchased the Echo after finding it interesting from a friends purchase. I am enjoying all the things that my Echo does and still learning as there seems to be an unlimited amount of knowledge and endless options of things to do with my Alexa.
1,"I use it mainly when I am traveling to read books, watch movies, listen to music, play games and check email. Works very well and does everything that I need."
1,"We were searching for a speaker and considered one which would be louder, but the Echo does so much. She is a speaker, but also a shopping list, whole-home control, encyclopedia, news source, etc. I would definitely recommend."
1,Kept my kids busy on road trip & while I cook daily
1,"So the only complaint I could see most people had was that the battery life was poor compared to previous/non-backlit versions. I will say that is true, however, with about an hour to 30 minutes of reading, I can go a few weeks between charges. I feel that is very reasonable.As with the Kindle e-readers, I have had very good luck with them. They are well built, devices and very easy on the eyes. The device has a good texture and does not feel like it will slip out of your hand while reading.Overall I'm very happy with my new Kindle. Its so much easier on the eyes! Worth every penny!"
1,"The fire is a decent tablet. It mostly uses the Amazon store so you are limited as to some of the apps. If you want something not HD to watch YouTube or search the net, then it is worth the purchase. For the price it is a well made product."
1,"I initially went to buy a speaker just to listen to music around the house but I was talked into getting this instead. Best choice ever! Not only do I listen to my music I also play games, listen to all the unusual facts she spews out, I ask her questions when I'm trying to cheat on my jeopardy game on my phone, I use it as a reminder for all my shopping items that randomly come to my mind everyday! I literally take her everywhere I can connect to wifi! I don't have anything negative to say other than I kinda wish it was portable and didn't have to be plugged in everywhere but I guess that's what the tap is for right ? I would recommend 100%! Also fun fact I love when a commercial comes on about the product and she hears her name she responds it was quite funny when it initially happened!"
1,"It's a great tablet, I ended up buying two more!!!"
1,So far it is really cool. If your big on Amazon shopping. Also Alexa understands what I'm saying. Alexa is always getting better every week. Love how it plays music for me when I want it to. Great by Amazon. Get one! :)
1,"Got her set up, but still have to learn to connect to phone and my smart TV. Need to look up the info for help as I didn't purchase the set-up help that you can buy with it. I'll learn. Right now asking for weather, using the timer, and asking questions about things works out great. Even grandchildren like asking her things. Can't wait to set her up with TV."
1,Much quicker than the fire tv stick! A nice upgrade
1,Lightweight but not water resistant like the Nook.
1,"I like the sound and the wireless capability. Looks good, too."
0,"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her."
0,"I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price."
1,Nice amazon fire tv ... Super quad core processor good box to see apps
1,I bought this for my 7 yo and I highly recommend it. You can set a timer for learning activities they have to meet before they can play games. Easy to use and the size is perfect.
1,I like the overall tablet. What I don't like is the constant ads that pop up because they want you to purchase whatever app you're using. Kind of annoying.
1,I got the Kindle Paperwhite to read on the beach. The screen is easily read in the sun. The compact size is nice for travel too.
1,Loving my new Kindle. Debated long and hard over weather to get one and then which one. Great decision!
1,Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use.
1,"I really like this tablet but, I was amazed by the weight of it compared to my wife's 6"" Kindle tablet. The 7' version is quite a bit heavier which makes it a bear to hold for long periods. Other than that, it's great!"
0,Great product for what it is designed for. Easily modified for Kodi
1,Gave as a gift and has been truly enjoyed by their whole family.
0,"The earlier models were so simple to use. No nonsense listing of books in it's library, by author or title. Now there are big pictures with tiny lettering and lots of ads."
1,for those of us that truly just want to read literature and do not necessarily need to browse the web this is a must have.
1,The Fire is a fantastic tablet and is so economical. My granddaughter loves it!
1,Ergonomic and easy to get new books. My house is full of books and I need to quit stockpiling them. And I can't remember what I read years ago. This device helps.
1,"All I need,Great table great screen works as it should."
1,it is very nice to be able to get all the shows and movies I want to watch
1,So easy to set up and use. Downloading books from the library has never been easier. Had an older Nook before this and the weight is similar. Liked the Nook button on the back to turn it off better than this one located on the bottom edge.
1,I'm a repeat buyer on this item many times over for all my family members. It is fast and much better then firesticks and we'll worth the difference in price.
1,"Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
1,She Loves the white background. She is very Happy with it.
1,I love love my amazon Echo. I love hearing the deals of the day from amazon and it makes shopping really easy.
1,"From what I am told, it is excellent! Was a gift..."
1,I love the Amazon White for its size and lighted screen.
1,"Easy to set up for use and to add skills to personalize Alexa for you own use. Turn on lights, get the news, sports and weather by asking. A nice addition."
1,"The Echo is now the third device in our growing Echo household. We started with an Echo Dot for Christmas last year. We loved it. I bought an Echo Tap for my husband for his birthday to be able to take in the yard or garage while he works outside. We now have the Original Echo and love it just as much.Having multiple Echos in the house allows us to use it as an intercom with the new ""Drop In"" feature. Also love the new ""Multi-Room Audio"" that was added with the latest update"
1,"I have had an older version of this Kindle and I really like it! I decided to buy one for my sister, as we share a love of reading. She was very surprised and immensely pleased!"
1,Voice recognition is outstanding. Useful for setting an alarm to asking questions on the web.
0,"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
1,Amazing product which allows me to easily keep up with my E-Mail.
1,Love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. The unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. Our son Not only loves playing Minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.
1,"Good deal, better than purchasing from Amazon, from BB, you get the points, but get nothing from Amazon."
1,Got it for my daighter and its a great tablet for a starter. Easy to ise and has great graphics .
1,It gives me a lot of fun and easy to find what you're looking for something and you don't know what you want!
1,This tablet is so easy to use for all ages. Already comes charged & ready to use.
1,this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck
1,"I recently got rid of cable and WiFi at home as it all just became way too expensive. I wanted something that would run off of my hotspot on my phone as I have an unlimited plan. It connects to it as soon as I have it on, there is no lagging, doesn't take long to load any of my streaming services either. It is very easy to navigate through the menu and do everything. Steup was a breeze, I love the voice feature (definitely comes in handy)."
1,I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
1,"I purchased two of these tablets, for my 10 and 11 year old daughters. They work great! Very good deal for the price."
1,I love my kindle fire tablet. Purchased this one to replace a stolen one.
1,"Got this for my 4 year old daughter, she enjoys playing games and reading books. A faster processor would me it better."
1,The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
1,"Bought it for my mom, it was real easy to transfer her downloads from her phone to the tablet.."
1,My family has enjoyed the amazon echo..it gives us the opportunity to listen to different types of music . My family loves sports and they like asking Alexa questions about sports .
1,This reader does what I expected and has good battery life.
1,"Got this as an upgrade to my Kindle Touch. Page turns are crisp (the pressure-sensitive page buttons on the sides are a nice addition). I especially like the self-adjusting brightness. Very happy with the purchase. Battery life is great so far, even with the backlight on."
1,Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
0,good for a kid which is why I bought it. If given the choice I will always choose apple.
1,My eyes are unaffected by the paperwhite and it truly feels like reading a real book. Love ability to download a new one on the fly and to highlight and get it all sent to my email after! Very impressed
1,"Control it all with your voice, need I say more? Very user friendly and easy to set up. Once you start using Echo, you will wonder why you didn't before."
1,I have had the fire tv stick for years now and this far outperforms the old fire tv stick. The ability to wire the device is a nice addition.
1,"Although not as preferable as the gaming edition that we already owned, this model is also very nice. If you are looking to run KODI along with whatever build you may choose ex. Wookie a free build info found on YouTube or BeausBuild a paid build info found on FB or local to OKC. We are running both. One on this model and one on the gaming edition. Currently Amazon shows the gaming edition unavailable but we have been on a mad hunt for one more because it is faster and comes with a game controller making operation much easier. I would love for Best Buy to track down any remaining gaming units and make them available but overall this unit is an excellent choice and will run very smoothly with plenty of room for other applications."
1,"If you are someone who enjoys reading for long periods of time, then you will really like the Kindle Paperwhite. The battery life is phenomenal, usually only requiring charging once every 7-10 days with daily reading. The text is very crisp and clear. The backlight is nice for reading in the dark, however you will note a little uneven lighting and a 'ghost' effect of text at times in the background. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who reads for long periods of time."
1,"Though not super noticible the resolution is better on the voyage. Also the fact that the screen doesn't dip in and is flat all the way across was a huge plus for me, having a toddler that spills stuff on it if I leave it lying around. The page turn button features on the sides are kinda pointless though. All in all, love it!"
1,Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do.
1,I got this gift for the wife for a starter tablet and she loves it!
1,So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
1,Love the Amazon Echo. Easy to set up and I learn new features every day. Fun to use.
1,"You cannot beat the fire stick for the money, a great bargain to say the least."
1,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient
1,Cheap and works great awesome beginner tablet amazon did a great job affordable and great for something just to have and play with
1,This tablet is a good buy for the price. Allows quick and easy access to the internet. Great product for a 1st time user.
1,this box is definitely better than the fire stick. if you have amazon prime and Netflix you don't really need cable with this box.
1,Really satisfied with my purchase it's a good product for those just starting to get familiar with using tablets. Amazons a good product.
1,"Bought the Tap for my mom to primarily listen to music. Although my mom forgets ""the girl's name"" haha, we've found Alexa will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi. Sound is great, too! Pleased!"
1,I got this for reading late at night and the reader is a easy way to read at night.
1,Bought this kindle for my aging mother! It is our third. She loves it! My daughter loves hers as well! Easy to use...even for someone in their 80's!
1,This version of it is harder to use. Prefer old one
1,My kids love them. Great alternatives to laptop or desk top
1,"Love it, tells me weather, controls my house, I can set a timer without having to touch anything....."
0,I think Ok Google can do the same or more. I found annoying by saying Amazon or other echo names repeatedly to get some answers if you get them. May be in future I may try when it is more practical
1,Alexia works well still a few bugs that need to be worked out but She gets better every day.
1,"Since we amazon prime it give us a lot of entertainment for my grandson music and videos , good and small investment."
1,I recommend this device to all my friends. Endless capabilities from streaming your favorite movie to playing video games like grand theft auto. Buy it and add Kodi! You're welcome!
1,Seems to be great quality for the price. Works great.
1,Everything you could want in a tablet including Bluetooth. Some popular game apps not available. The camera is very poor quality. Hard to find an inexpensive shockproof case. I got it for $35 on black Friday and it does the job well.
1,Great for any age. Tons of apps to download. My kids stay busy for hours without the tablet dieing. I would recommend to others.
1,"I purchased this product for my neice as a gift, the camera isn't very good, but other than that it has all the features she needs to play games, watch movies, stream music, and she even uploaded some of her music from her music libarary for listening. Has NetFlix and Prime Movies if you have a subscription."
1,I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.
1,The ECHO was easy to set up. It also was easy to learn how to use. It was a gift for my wife and she loves it.
1,I bought this for my 10 year old son so he could read books and of course play games. I bought a 16gb micro SD card to use with it because I knew the 8gb wouldn't be enough.My son loves it! He reads his books and plays all types of games. And thanks to the Amazon Underground app most of his games are free. While this tablet doesn't have enough power for me it is perfect for him!
1,"Easy set up, fun to use and sound quality is surprisingly good in our large open area."
1,"$50 for a tablet, yes please! I gave it a whirl and what a great tablet for the cost. Its pretty quick in the apps, i thought it might lag or be a little slow, I was wrong!"
1,Still learning to use the Echo. My new friend Alexa is very informative and fun. Great sound too.
1,Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.
0,"I was looking for a Kindle Fire because I have had other android tablets in the past and most times the Kindle app makes them crash or takes up too much space on the tablet. I like it for reading but it isn't as great for other things and you are not allowed to have the Google Play store on it because that competes with the Amazon app store. However, not all apps are available on the Amazon app store so this was an immediate drawback for me. I will keep this and use it but in the future I will not buy Kindle tablets again."
1,Excellent tablet.....withstands a special needs Grandson.
1,"I had the firestick first so I decided to upgrade my new TV with a fireTV and I haven't had any issues it's so easy to use runs way smoother than my firestick, and I love that I can upload storage with my micro SD card."
1,I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
1,"This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will."
1,I bought this as a gift for my daughter to replace an older version. She was happy to have a new Kindle after about 5 years.
0,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
1,"Have several Dots. Those that I want to play music over I have hooked into an external speaker. Rather that spend close to $200 on a sonos speaker plus the cost of the dot, I choose the echo as the best solution for the bathroom. Got the white color. Fits great on chair rail. White cord is easy to hide. One unforeseen issue is that it does go load enough that I have to wait for a break in the music before I can ask alexa to skip or turn down volume."
1,"I've purchased this tablet for myself, my boys (10 and 18) and my nephew (16). It's perfect for everybody!"
1,I bought on for my 2yo nephew ad he and his cousins love it. Going to buy another for my other nephew so they no longer have to share.
0,"Most of the things you ask it, it doesn't know the answer to"
1,"Easy, great tone, and amazing!I gave it as a gift and they had no problem setting it up with Amazon. Listen to music immediately and it obeyed commands . Great !"
1,"I bought this like 2 months and it's perfect, fast and durable My kids play YouTube all the timeThey love their tablet."
1,"It's a nice gadget. Sometimes though it cannot understand what I'm wanting her to do. But the more you use it, the better it gets."
1,"If you are a Prime member and use Kindle for reading, this a great tablet. I wish there were more apps made to work in the Fire tablet, like NFL Mobile and NFL Fantasy."
1,I have purchased the Paperwhite for 4 of my children. They all love the portability and the light up screen. Perfect for travel and reading in bed.
1,Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.
1,The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!
1,This is the second one I purchased This one is for our second home. We enjoyed the first one we purchased for a primary home
1,Outstanding product. Will buy another one in the future.
1,Works great as a streaming devise. Menu interfaces are easy to navigate.
1,asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading."
1,Got this for $39.99 and it is so worth the price. The girls can read on their own devices and I can limit the time on each device as well as the content.
1,I bought this for my daughter 17 and my nephew 6. They both loved it. It's lightweight inexpensive and very easy to use and set up .The one drawn back you need be on wifi.
1,"My 2nd generation Kindle finally died so I bought the Paperwhite as a replacement Love the size, weight, screen feel and best of all the backlighting. Can't go wrong with a Kindle Paperwhite!"
1,great speaker and alexa is awesome. works seamless with phone and with amazon service. directional mic is great
1,Works well love the 4k a must for anyone who owns a 4K TV east to hookup and use
1,It's definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have
1,We use Alexa every day and it is fun to try new things.
1,"Great tablet for the purpose of reading, also inexpensive"
1,This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
1,I'm glad that I choose to buy it with discount! It's really good for killing your time
1,The kids really enjoy this. They play for hours on them. Keeps them occupied.
1,"Echo is not only fun but a valuable tool. It saves time in getting weather, daily news, my calendar appointments, etc."
1,"Got this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it, it is hard to beat for the price."
1,This is an Awesome product. Would highly recommend.
1,Very affordable and user friendly! It has a microSD card slot expandable up to 128GB.
1,Great for the internet... ....Saves my phone battery
1,Wanted a simple tablet and this ended up meeting our expectations.
1,Great product bought it for my youngest daughter and she loves it. Would recommend to anyone.
1,This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.
1,"Like Siri 2.0. Lots of fun and a decent speaker. Though, wish it were easier to get auidobooks and music on it, etc. Doesn't always get what you were looking for but still tries to get something close to it. Gives helpful overviews and recaps of news and weather."
1,"I loved me previous Kindle but always had to keep light on to read in the dark. The backlight on this makes it so much easier to read in the dark, it's not too bright and battery goes for about two weeks. The resolution is higher too, font looks crisp and sharp."
1,Very good Product. Easy to read with the extra lightings. Look wise it is good
1,Love it!! Alexa keeps me on track with everything!!
1,"Other members in my family had a Kindle Fire, and I saw how great it worked so I got one. I love it."
1,This was one of the best purchases that I have ever made.
1,This was bought for my nephew for his birthday and he absolutely loves it..
1,"Great with music, weather, news and Shopping List!!!!! I'm sure that it will only get smarter when asking more directed questions regarding persons, places and things. It is definitely something my family and I use every day!!!!!"
0,"It's the thing to have, to go along with the crowd, but it ends up being very much underutilized. I'm sure it's capable of more than making a shopping list and doing a flash briefing. But we don't have the time to learn. Other than that, it works just fine."
1,"I was looking for something new to use to read with and this was a good choice. Easy to navigate, multi functional and great color!"
1,"This device is very innovative and fun to use and some learning curve on how to use voice command. Its speaker can be improved though it's a bit deep base, lacks of manual control and hope the upgrade will include more features and compatible with Google. Overall very good product."
1,I love this tablet. I got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it.
1,Waited for the under $90 deal. Product arrived as expected and works great.
1,I love it good bye Apple TV and Roku. A must have for the digital age..!
1,Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers.
1,Best e-reader in the world ! Now even looks better !
1,"I got this for my kids, we use the freeplay for $3 a month. We added a 16gb memory card. It is not an hd screen, but it still looks good. And it's faster than other quad core tablets, probably because it's not running heavy graphics. Great for casual use and children."
1,Picked this up to keep the book reading and main tablet games on different devices. Been working good so far for the whole family.
1,Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
1,I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
1,Kindle is awesome. Operates similar to iPad only much much cheaper.
1,"Had purchased one of these for my family for Christmas and they absolutely loved it. Bought the Echo Dot for a co-worker and they wouldn't stop talking about it. Decided to buy my wife this for her birthday and all I can say is Wow! Super easy to set up, a blast to use, and connects to all sorts of connected home devices like light switches and wifi router. Plays Jeopardy and reads you the news in the morning along with playing music on command. Love setting alarms, reminders, adding to a shopping list, and making purchases on Amazon by voice. Definitely buy this if you want to make your home so much dinner!"
1,Such a great product I have no complaints. I broughts this product for my family also and they love it
1,I got this for my 3 year old after he broke my tablet. It is perfect for him! I love that it comes with all the games and apps. He has dropped it several times and no issues.
1,Best Buy always offers great products at great prices. There sales are outstanding and I always find their sales persons to be knowledgeable and friendly.
1,"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
1,Love it!! I can carry it and use it anywhere! I've already purchased 4more as gifts! My family really enjoyed getting them!
1,Purchased during the 1/2 price sale. Definitely worth the money.
1,"Echo/Alexa wake me in the morning, keeps me company with music during the day and sounds the alarm for me to go to bed. Really have not put it through its paces and have not bought any ""smart"" attachments. Would not work with my enterprise network/w-fi at work, but it a nice touch at home."
1,"I bought the Kindle Paperwhite after my Kindle Fire quit working. I read every day. I really liked the Fire except I couldn't read outside on my deck with it. The paperwhite is only a reader, no internet access but that's fine with me. It's lightweight and easy to use. Very happy with my purchase"
1,"Very satisfied with the product, I have one for each of my kids now and for that the price point is amazing. I have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point, I ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them. The color I ordered for my 6 year old came in but they sent the 16 gig rather than the 8 gig. Instead of GIVING me the color my 6 year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely INSISTED that they couldn't do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my 6 year old son who did not get the color he had wanted. Very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy."
1,Love Kindle fire bought for an elderly friend and she just love the ease of use.
1,This is a great tablet. My grandson uses it to watch his cartoons. We also have ABC Mouse that he uses on it. It's very durable and he loves it!!
1,"Not only was this on sale for an amazing price, but I love the parent controls on the Amazon Kindle!"
1,purchased for grandchildren easy to use they love it
1,"I purchased the Fire Tablet basically as an e-reader. However, after finding out how to install the Google Play Store, it is much more. Nothing speedy or top of the line, but what would one expect for the price. No regrets!"
1,Three of my children have 1 of these tablets each and really love it. Don't like that it doesn't have google chrome or PLAY store but a solid tablet for a great price.
1,This tablet so far has been great for the price. Even though it isn't the HD quality tablet I've found the res on this one to be pretty awesome.
1,This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.
1,"bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied."
1,My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids.
1,"Works great, as expected!"
1,"Voice recognition is astounding with only a few hang ups, mostly because of my accent. Great app to aid Alexa in to-dos and lists. New skills are added often to even further Alexa's uses. Only thing I would change is the ability to connect to another Bluetooth speaker for Pandora Radio."
1,Bought it for my kids and they love it. So then I bought myself one. I rake it every where
1,"I couldn't pass up this""deaL of the day"" - a tablet for under $35! The Fire is a great basic tablet. I wish the sound was better but that can be addressed via a Bluetooth speaker."
1,"We no longer have Directv or anything else. Chose this to have something else to watch on TV. If you are a Prime member with Amazon there are tons of shows, movies, games, etc. to watch/use."
1,Sturdy item great value for price. User friendly. Highly recommend.
1,Amazon Alexa is the hottest new electronics product out there and for good reason. We are using it daily and haven't begun to tap its full potential applications.
1,Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing.
1,Bought it for my cuz lil boy he likes it very much.
1,I bought this for reading/listening books. Love the availability to expand the memory. Now I can load movies and tons of books! :-)
1,"Having enjoyed Amazon Prime for several years, I thought to bring it to the next level when Alexa support came to the Amazon Fire TV. Complete access to all my Prime benefits, newest shows/movies, music and more! Screen mirroring works good too. Unfortunately I do not have much time to lounge around and use it more. Overall a good buy!"
1,"I can't say how happy I am with this purchase. No worries of lighting, or holding a book open. All my books stored in this kindle which opens up lots of space in my home. Easy & light to carry."
1,"The Amazon fire HD10 is one of the best deals on the market. I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10! It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better"
1,Alexa is a great addition to the household. Very user friendly and so many questions/commands to be used.
1,I have been using a kindle for many years. I love the ability to have all the books I am reading on one device.
1,"Performs much better than our old Roku and the Firestick! Seems to be way faster, much clearer w/ no buffering issues. I just wish it came with a qwerty keyboard."
1,It does what I need it to do and if very affordable
1,"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry."
1,Easy to setup and use connects to Wi Fi and streams flawlessly. There are a lot of free channels to stream. Great product that can do so much. I highly recommend this product for the diehard that is into steaming TV from the internet.
1,We love our Amazon echo!! Very easy to setup and use. It's fun to ask Alexa anything. She never disappoints.
1,Wish it searched the Internet like Siri. But over all it's super cool. Does a lot. And voice recognition is great!
1,I actually purchased this tablet on Black Friday 2015 for my son. It works great with no problems. I bought 2 more as gifts for my nephews on Black Friday 2016. Plenty of green games to download. Great for kids !!
1,My daughter loves it. She can make her videos and listen to her music.
1,I loved the price for this tablet good value for what my son uses it for!!
1,Good technology. Does not follow command sometimes.
1,I am going on a 30 day cruise and didn't want to haul a lot of books. This is the perfect choice. The text is very clear. Highly recommend.
1,"The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc..."
1,Some questions asked are not answered. Some answers are amusing.
1,My is addicted to it. Every spare moment she is reading books on her Kindel. We both buy books using our Kindles. We like to talk about our thoughts and impressions as we read them together.
0,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing."
1,Fantastic E-Reader. Battery lasts a few weeks on a single charge (if you leave wifi turned off). Feels great in your hands. Is very lightweight.
1,"This is a pretty substantial tablet, lots of learning apps and the ability to download Netflix is a plus"
1,Love love love this thing. I listen to all my jams in the morning while checking in the the forecast so I always if a sweater is needed. Lol
1,This is a really good tablat at a good price.. my sister bought one naby tablet from another store at $200 and is not even working she has troble to charge the naby tablet for that reason i gave her the amazon tablet is not expensive and also has good feautures.
1,Great product for anyone who loves to read. I highly recommend it.
1,Very fun and useful product that can only get better with time. Kind of similar to Siri or Google Assistant on Steroids but has the potential to be so much better!
1,Love it. Does more than just allow me read can go online
1,Alexa is great.. Right now she only answer my questions. It is a joy looking at others trying to ask her a question and I walk up and ask her and she respond.
1,i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.
1,It's easy to use. Compact enough to easily fit into my purse. Love carrying it with me wherever I go to read when I get some down-time.
1,love my fire. its much better looking at this screen instead of my phone. and my other computer is big. this is just right to things I need to do like watching videos or tv in quiet place.
1,I really enjoy this Kindle Fire. The ability for expanding the storage is a life saver.
1,I got this on sale and you can't beat the value of the item for the price!
1,"Got for my 8 year old. The parental controls are nice. I wish the netflix app was registered as ""video"", so I could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. I'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. He Star Wars Commander, netflix, and reads books. It's a good size for little hands. It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching."
1,"I heard so much about fire TV and went out and bought it at the local Best Buy store and i must say that I'm very happy with my new fire TV the movie selection is great, now i can watch what i want when i want."
1,2 thumbs up! Alexa works great. Recognizes voice with no problems.
1,I have been using my phone to play games and Facebook. This Tablet is awesome. Wish I had bought several more for my grand children.
1,I love product and features keep updating.I love the updates of things Alexa can do.
1,Absolutely makes my home feel more updated. I use her to control all of my lights and TV's
1,I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
1,"I like the kindle paper white because you don't need s light on to read it,"
1,"The 7"" fire tab is a good buy for the money, especially if you got it when it was on sale for 35.00."
1,"This has to be the best $35 I ever spent. The small tablet exceeded my expectations. I use it to supplement my smartphone, and watch tv, read books, check email and Internet on it."
1,This was an easy purchase over the Internet and store pick up. I like the fire over the fire stick. You get more ram and can side load apps with micro SD card.
0,"I was a bit disappointed by the lack of the Android play store, navigation on it is a pain."
1,I used to use an amazon fire tv stick which worked fine. A friend recommended trying the fire tv because it was faster and had the ability to have more storage. Tried it and haven't looked back since.
1,brought this to replace a tablet that my girlfriend lost it's perfect for her it fits her hand and she can still do most of the things that she did on her old tablet way to go Amazon
1,"Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my teeth when I run out of hands, and after a week I can still see my tooth marks (whereas on the K3 case I couldn't). Also, even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear. UPDATE: Most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as I originally thought.The only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed, but this has actually not been much of a problem for me. Quite often I like to frisbee toss my Kindle onto a nearby soft surface (like carpet or a pillow or bed) and I was afraid the cover would flap open every time, but 10 times out of the 11 I tried it stayed shut just fine.Read more"
1,Very good to see on nite. I love it thanks Pedro on Best Buy if south beach for take ur time to explain me. Thanks Best Buy
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.
1,I like that this tablet can grow with my 5 year old. I love the various age settings and the parental controls. Perfect first tablet!
1,The Amazon Echo has very good voice recognition. It works just as advertised and is quick with the responses. I was glad to see it at best buy so I could touch it and try it before I bought it. The setup was easy and quick.
1,"I can make a grocery list, request my favorite songs, turn my lights on / off all with my Amazon Echo!!!"
1,"I prefer the deficated e-readers to tablets for reading. I have both this Paoerwhite and a current-gen Nook Glow Light. I really like the Glow Light ‚Äî especially its rugged construction ‚Äî and I still use it, but the Paperwhite is better.The Glow Light has no bevel and a touch-sensitive button on the front. This means I am constantantly turning the page or returing to the home screen by accident. It's very annoying, and I have a hard time finding a comfortable way to hold it. It seems like I'm always thinking about where my fingers are. I do not have this problem at all on the Paperwhite.The Paperwhite is a great little reader for the money. I would definitely buy another."
1,Nice to listen to music and tv anywere in my home.
1,Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
1,WORKS VERY WELL ITS VERY FAST AND MAKES LOOKING FOR YOUR SHOWS A REAL TREAT MUCH FASTER THEN THE OTHER MODELS IVE USED I SAY GOOD JOB
1,Alexa runs my whole house love it does what I want her to do the best and best buy is number 1 to me
1,I bought this product as a gift for my son. He really likes it a lot.
1,"Paper white does everything I've wanted in a reader. Light, great lighted background, and the easiest to use."
1,Excellent. Grandchildren love them. They were so excited to receive this and have not put it down since. Even my 2 year old is having a ball
1,Don't know how I managed without Alexa. Everyone in the family is enjoying her.
1,my dauther loves the tablet and I can get the SD to get more storage and load up all the disney movies that I purchased. it is a great purchase.
1,My sister told me about the Kindle Fire and I wanted one so she said she bought hers from Best Buy.
1,"A great beginner to experience tablet users. Even though its amazon, you can still get through the net to google."
1,"The kindle fire is a great tablet, you can do lots with it and it seems well made."
1,"I purchased this two weeks ago and we have watched it every night. It is extremely fast, has 4k content and has a nice voice remote"
1,"Great speaker! I love the Amazon echo, it is a great addition to the home."
1,"Very happy with the Fire Tv box. I use it to watch live tv on the Playstation Vue app and the picture clarity is great. It freezes up sometimes, I'm not sure if thats a problem with my wifi connectivity, the fire tv, or the app."
1,Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point.
1,Extremely satisfied with the value and performance of the Fire kids edition; highly recommend for age 5 and up.
1,"Good tablet for reading, playing and browsing. Value for money"
1,Love my kindle. Easy to use. My daughter has a kindle and we can share books.
1,"Grandson plays outside with it Love that it has the protected case Plays games with the other kids,"
1,You can not go wrong with the fire tv the only biggest problem is it's hard to get your hand on one
1,PURCHASED THE FIRE BOX WITH THE INTENT OF GETTING A 4K TV.
1,The screen is easy to read even on the beach and I love being able to download a new book at any time
1,Functionality is awesome and it can do a lot of cool stuff. The speaker is good in small rooms.
1,Provides all the advantages of a kindle reader plus many of the aspects of a smart phone - less of course the telephone
1,The Amazon Echo is a great product. It has many skills that can be addedand is very easy to set up. The voice control feature works very well and the Echo has great sound.
1,I purchased the Kindle fire about three weeks ago and rarely pick up my iPad anymore. It is a great reading device with the flexibility of allowing you to access many other basic applications. I carry it with me practically all the time.
0,"I got this because my fire stick always gives a warning that it is too hot. Haven't had this problem but did experience problem. I have my ps4, apple tv, running through a hdmi switch. no problem when I had the fire stick plugged in. The amazon TV will not work with the switch. For it to work it needs to be connected directly. I have three tv's and three different switches didn't work on any and yes I tried different chords. Other than that works great."
1,Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it's perfect for her. She loves it!
1,"Easy enough for my 3 yr old to use, great deal!!!!"
1,"great price on this tablet, now if only my kids could let me borrow it for a while"
1,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas. It was easy to set up, has a great sound, and works great."
1,its great
1,Perfect gift for my nephew. He is 10 and loves to play games and his mom loves the parental control feature.
0,"Bought 2, 1 did not work out of the box. Too slow, too much trouble to setup and requires amazon account to use. Returned both items"
1,"This has been a great solution to use one device to broadcast Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, Spotify and Pandora! Lots of other possibilities yet to try but very happy with ease of connecting and convenience when using!"
1,Most tv's come with all the viewing apps you need but they're not portable. FireTV has everything you want plus it fits neatly in your suitcase.
1,Great service. Great product for reading in sunlight.
1,performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
0,"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me."
1,Very good product. I recommend to anyone to buy it.
1,This Fire worked great but I returned it because it was not the one I wantedBest Buy took it back for a full refund with no problems Best Buy is alsome
1,"get more movies,shows channels great price easy to install and usenet more for your money"
1,Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.
1,"I bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. It works great. I love the child-proof case that it comes with. My only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. I'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of Android. I typically avoid Android but I figured I would give it a shot. After using this tablet, I think I will avoid using Android products again. Besides the slowness of the Android OS, it is still a great tablet."
1,The Kindle gets a lot of use in our house and we've not had a problem with the device after 30 days
1,great
1,Great product. Highly recommended. Great value and great price
1,My son loves his tablet he received for his birthday!
1,"Had a very, very old Kindle so this was quite a change. Like the size, the paperwhite (didn't think I would) and the back-lighting.."
1,"Great product, easy to hook up and use. Alexa is easy to use as well."
1,Replaced older kindle with paper white. Light control Akers reading in dark areas better than non-paper white models.
0,Paper white does not allow you do use books from the library as you cannot load apps. Only books from Amazon are available to read.
1,Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
1,"My granddaughter bought my first Kindle Fire for me. After that, I bought one for my husband and one for my friend. They are great!"
1,Got a good deal an ECHO at Best Buy. It was easy to set up works great.
1,Didn't really need this but it came in a kit with my kindle. Can never have too many.
1,If you love the Fire Stick you'll love Fire Tv !!!! Fire Tv is a Fire Stick on steroids !!!! Much clearer and loads much faster !!!
0,"Not sure what all the hype is about, this AI is remedial at best. It responds with the exact same answer to vastly different questions. Not intuitive at all. Save your money."
1,You can't beat the price. Perfect tablet for a child.
1,The tablet is very nice and so easy to youse I have it to my mother for Christmas!
1,One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
1,"This is awesome and very fun to have, even our grandkids request songs and they are 6 and 3"
1,"After using a series of low end tablets as an e-Reader, I purchased this on sale for $50. It only really does one thing - display Kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.Size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike LCD-based tablets it is easy to read outside. The Amazon lock-screen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore."
1,"This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok"
1,Very satisfied with this item! Very user friendly.. even the kids use it frequently!
1,"I love this Amazon Fire Tv, I can watch all my past shows...i love it so much that I bought 2 Amazon Fire Tv. I would recommend this to my family members."
1,This is a fantastic EReader - very light and hand hold is just right. Love the backlight feature for reading at night without needing a light on.
1,Great product for children to enjoy for a low price.
0,A bit confusing compared to the older style. I am not a big fan of this version. I wish we could take off things that we are not using like we could with the older version. Great for the price.It has an awesome parental control though.
1,It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
1,I bought for my niece and she loves it. The fact that you can add memory is good because the 16gb will fill up fast...
1,was able to get this on black friday awesome deal for an awesome tablet!
1,I find the Kindle Paperwhite to be much easier on the eyes then reading from a tablet. Page turning is a bit slower than on the tablet but the headaches are less.
1,"We bought this Amazon Fire TV to use for our Sony PlayStation Vue package as part of our cord-cutting plan. We are also Amazon Prime members so it made sense for that application also. The picture is great on our Samsung 65"" 4K tv. The only drawback so far (why I only gave it 4 stars) is that our Logitech Harmony 650 remote will not operate it, thereby forcing us to keep track of the remote."
1,Purchased for father who is enjoying the flexibility and ease of use
1,We had previously owned Kindle paperwhite version 1 and this is a substantial improvement. The new screen is much brighter and the response is quicker .
1,Got this so my mother in law could Skype with my brother in law who lives in another country. Works well for that.
1,I love the amazon tablets because you can get some many free kids games. My kids use this tablet all the time. Very reliable.
1,"This was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. We have had 3 other tablets in the past (all different brands), and she tells me this is the nicest one so far. We have only had it for about a week, but it has sure gotten it's use :) Very happy with this purchase."
1,"Loved my other kindle, but love this new one even more. Particularly enjoy the thinner size and lighter weight."
1,I got one for Christmas and loved it bought this one for my son and he loves his
1,I asked for a roku4 for Christmas but got Amazon Fire instead. I've never had either one but so far I really like Amazon Fire. I just wanted something faster than my DVD player that takes too long to update and this has been perfect.
1,Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire.
1,Love love love it!!! Best purchase ever!!! Love listening to music and sound is great!!!
1,"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick."
1,"Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life"
1,"I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty."
1,"This is the best by far I brought a different kind and had a lot of problems purchased the amazon stick and had no problem streaming movies,shows or playing games"
1,"Unlike the larger version, this does not need to be plugged in..making it portable....although you have to press the button for every request..it's great to take with you where ever you go..fully rechargable"
1,My mother in law loves her kindle!! She plays her games on it and can use it without glasses!
1,"Gift for spouse, easily downloaded books. Uses while waiting for kids to finish school activities. Definitely recommend."
1,The camera was very clean and being able to use the child user option is fantastic for toddlers.
1,"Ok, so Alexa can't answer everything but so far I've asked the same questions to Siri and Alexa and get better answers from Alexa. Looking forward to growing my home automation system now. Volume is pretty good. Also bought a dot which will be used with my receiver."
1,This l'il baby does everything my wife wants from her laptop without forcing her to sit at a table to do it. For the money this cannot be beaten!
1,"I was in need of a quality bluetooth speaker and, as an Amazon Prime member, I figured I would give this a shot. I was blown away by the quality of the sound and the quality of the controls. I put it up their with Sonos and Bose as far as sound. The voice activations and commands have never failed to work for me and at full volume she can rattle some windows. The only drawback is it is not portable and requires an outlet to operate. Otherwise, you can't go wrong."
1,"It is easy to use, economical, and perfect in size for a college student, but isn't good for HD my daughter said."
1,Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
0,i love the service when it works. several times it had to be reset and now it's finally dead. i've had it less than a yr now...
1,"This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already."
1,I love mine so much I bought my grandkids all one.
1,"I bought this to replace a firestick I gave to a family member. Faster, due to its ability to connect via Ethernet to your router. It also has the ability to allow a hard drive to plug into it. A fantastic device!"
1,Many hours of fun and entertainment in using the Echo. Always interesting what Alexa will share with you.
1,Fun to use with the kids and works with a lot of products
1,I bought this e-Reader because I wanted to use it at the river and by the pool and still be able to see the screen in the sunlight. The Kindle Paperwhite didn't disappoint. Compact and a step above the basic e-Reader.
1,easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS
1,Great tablet for the price. My aunt is still loving it with no complaints.
1,"It's realy high quality tablet . My son love it, and it has many educational apps."
1,My daughter seems to like it very much. Had to buy micro sd since memory is very small. Very happy.
1,What else can I say? I can finally watch 4K content on my TV. The firetv is ever bit as good as the firestick.
1,I purchased this tablet as a gift for my son who is always up on any new books or games. He loves it and is always thanking me for getting it for him. The clarity and colors on the screen are amazing. This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying a kindle.
1,We bought it for our kids and they love it its really easy for them to use it
1,My kindle fire has been easy to use and allows me to read several books and magazines at a time with out the clutter.
1,My Grandkids love their kindle!! It offers so much for learning YouTube etc
1,"Use this everyday, everyone will find it convenient and useful. Great purchase and highly recommend!"
1,"This is the product to get you can watch movies, tv shows, play games what else do you need come on go down to your local best buy and purchase one right now"
1,"I like this 7"" tablet. It is a little slow starting up, but cost and display are very good. It is compact enough to take with you. Battery seems good so far.I put on a few games for the grandkids. I am glad I purchased this tablet."
1,Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
1,"When looking at kindles, I was debating between the paperwhite and the regular kindle that was a bit cheaper. So happy I spent the extra money for the paperwhite. Having the backlit screen has been such a life savor and great feature. I loved it while camping and is also nice when reading in bed because you don't need to have a light on waking up the other person. I absolutely love this version and recommend it 100%!!!!"
0,"I received an email asking if I would like to give my review and I am glad that I did. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. When it did work, it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several times during use. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Bought for my wife as Christmas present. She has early version of Kindle. She likes how little it weighs, and doesn't need a cover with separate light. She also likes swiping to turn pages rather than pushing a button. It is easy to read and has adjustable fonts.Only negative is after downloading a book, she has to search for it, rather than it automatically appearing on list of books."
0,This is not recommended if you have inpatient kids.
1,My high school aged daughter just wanted a small tablet to watch Netflix and read books. This tablet is the perfect fit and I don't have to worry about her carrying around her expense iPad to school. I'm thinking about getting one for Grandma too.
0,"I would say this is great for kids, but the apps are very limited. There are only a few good free apps in the kindle store. The battery life is very poor. The volume is either loud or it can't be heard. It's hard to find a good middle ground. Overall it's still a good tablet for the price."
1,"This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily"
1,"I was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. The one thing that hits you outright is the build-in marketing Amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. For instance, the home screen is filled with links for Amazon Video, Amazon Books, Amazon Gifts, etc, etc. You an't remove them, but I found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.After that, install a free app for a File Manager then go in and rename the folder(s) that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. You will also need to install Adobe Reader to read PDF files, since it isn't installed.Another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. After a while though you get to ignore it.Performance is great - fast and easy to navigate. The built-in browser has everything you should need. Battery life looks really good. I had the screen brightness at about 1/2 power and it looked good. The screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. If you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.Amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of Amazon products. Once you get around that, you see the value you get in this tablet."
1,I wanted to have something that I could use outside and not get a reflection or eyestrain from. I found the set-up a little clunky but overall I am very satisfied with the Paperwhite.
0,"This new technology does what it's intended to do. My kids love it. They talk to Alexa every day, listen to music and even ask homework questions."
1,Bought the tablet for my kids and they love it. I think it's prefect for them. It's a little bulky but perfect for them.
1,I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA
1,Nice tablet for my eight year old son. Very light and easy to set up.
0,Gives access to all streaming apps & doesn't seem too slow as far as responsiveness. Much better than the AF Stick. Haven't had any issues.
0,"I do like the Amazon TV idea. I do miss my DVR. I also miss all of the LIVE TV abilities though. Until Amazon TV gets LIVE TV abilities, this only gets 3 stars. Works well. Easy connect. But there are alot of reasons to miss Cable tv!! The channel selection needs to improve!"
1,"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
0,Nice tablet for kids. A little slow loading. The fire time is extremely hard for children to operate. I guess it's ok for kids and beginners. I haven't decided if we are going to keep it or return it.
1,Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"If we were going off of percentages this would get a 90%. This improves greatly over the old Fire Stick. With a faster processor, 4K support, and the freedom to install 3rd party apps, this is literally the only device you need to access just about anything you could ever need. The only gripe I have is that it is missing Vudu, otherwise, it's one of the best streamers currently available."
1,Best streaming tool I have seen and used!!!!!!!!!!
1,I purchased this as a gift after using this at another home. I have also tried similar products and I feel that this has the most interactive user interface. It continually is learning and has good sound quality for what we use it for.
1,Bought for Christmas and it has been a hit. Alexa is easy to use. Totally satisfied.
1,"This is the third fire in our house now and they're all solid, if unspectacular. For $40, the hardware can't be beat, but this newest version of the operating system is very clunky and not intuitive in the least. Once you get over th leading curve though, it's a good way to keep the boy quiet on a plane"
1,I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in English and foreign languages. She also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. She loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase.
1,Bought 2 of these for family members and they absolutely loved them! Connected to Wifi with no problems and downloaded apps quickly.
1,"Works great, I can stream Netflix and a ton of other apps."
1,Obviously talking about a budget tablet here so you obviously get what you pay for as always BUT this is a really decent tablet for $35 bucks (what i paid on black friday). does all your basic 'tabby' things and is very mobile. Great for those kids who feel the need for a tablet but you dont wanna break the bank haha.
1,"I bought the Amazon Echo for my husband because he loves music. I was expecting the sound to be okay, but not for it to sound as good as it does. The speakers are of excellent quality. He is very pleased with the quality of the sound, as am I.Even though we use the Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling the forecast and adding items to our shopping list, to be perfectly honest, Id love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and I hate having to unplug and move her."
1,"The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn."
1,It works bet well and my son enjoys using it for music and questions
1,"This is a good product for a good price. Please note my use of the word ""good"". The Amazon Fire tablet is not the best tablet on the market but it is a good deal for a low price. I bought this product as a gift for my mom and she likes it. It gets the job done. She uses it occasionally to read during her morning commute on the train or in a busy waiting room. This is not a product built for heavy use."
1,Friends of mine have one and said how great it was. I have the amazon fire stick in the house but thought this would be better in my living room. Easy set up.
1,This is exactly the product we were looking for. Would recommend this anyone
1,"Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!"
1,We bought this for my wife who loves to read. She always has it with her and doesn't put it down! Great product
0,Very slow ...I guess it's worth the 40 bucks.. great product for a child..
1,I love this product. Im using it more and more each day with the added skills.
0,My niece really enjoyed this tablet and she uses it alot.
1,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
1,This tablet was purchased as a gift. I've had 2 other Kindle tablets and they've always been great. Can't beat the price.
1,"Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it"
1,"There shouldn't be much to go wrong with an AC Adaptor, and this one is no exception."
1,"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
0,Received this as a gift. I don't use it much but family loves it.
1,The box is ok havint Sean any 4K content on it yet
1,"Love it it's like having a personal assistant, very good."
1,"Really enjoy the Echo. Very helpful in weather reports, traffic updates, timers, and music."
1,just an accesory but a usefull one
1,Great product I am thoroughly satisfied. Will purchase again if needed.
1,This is the fastest streaming device on the market. It's as if a mini computer is operating behind my television!!!
1,I heard nothing but good things about the fire tv. Although I had to ask around to see if someone could hook it up because it didn't come with instructions but overall I'm extremely happy.
1,"I do like Alexa. When asked a question and knows the answer, it is pretty neat. The answer is immediate as well. There have been many times where it did not know the answer. Maybe it didn't understand the question. I am looking forward to start getting some of the home connections to see how that works."
1,"This thing is awesome. Funny, easy to use and I think even has a personality. Easy to set up and sounds great musically. We use it it for research,music and setting timers for cooking. It will tell you the weather and how traffic looks. The future is finally here! Highly recommend checking this out."
0,This tablet is showing it's age. I bought one for my 10 year old back when he was 7 and it was cool then. Picked up two on sale for my 4 and 5 year old so they can leave my phone alone and they like it. However it's slow when downloading apps and I constantly have to plug in my pin. Battery life isn't that great either especially when they stream movies so i still have to give up my phone . Overall still a decent product hood picture and they like it.
1,I bought the Fire for my husband who is a senior citizen but does not use a computer. He loves it.
1,This Kindle Fire is very easy to use and has so many apps. Love it!
1,I only had a chance to download one movie and I was impressed with clarity of pic
1,Unbelievable how smooth it is. Great product.. soon would be must have for all.
1,Good solid tablet with ability to use mcSD cards at a great price. Only down side is Amazon interface restricts full android platform.
1,"I love the kindle. I'm not completely happy with the sound quality of the speaker's. And, a month later it already seems to be lagging and freezing a bit. I have one music app, several books, and a few games on it. I don't seem to be using it as much as my 7 during long trips just because of the size."
1,"I prefered reading actual books over reading digitally, because the screen made my eyes hurt. However, the kindle paperwhite isn't designed like a regular digital reader, it so different. I could read it for hours and my eyes won't hurt."
1,"Great gift for my daughter. She's a big time reader, it saves a lot of space and money."
1,The more you use Alexa the more she get to know you and the more she can find more about what you like
0,I set it up but haven't used it yet. Not clear how to download books but I plan to learn that this weekend.
1,This is a good basic tablet. It does every thing it is advertised well. Great if your a real amazon fan.
0,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
1,Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly.
1,Awesome price on Black Friday! Great tablet for reading and searching the Internet. Has expandable memory slots which is great!
1,"I like the echo, don't love it. It is really hard to remember what skills you have enabled, and how to ask questions related to the skills!!"
1,This item is great for kids reading! set up a Kindle account and they pick the books! Many free!
1,This is the third Alexa I have purchased Once you have one you get use to having one in your house
1,Great little charger. It works well. Price was great too.
1,Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person
1,"Grand child loves it, before she had to look at her favorite movies. On the computer monitor,Now she can look at her movies anywhere."
1,We actually bought these for summer camp and the kids love them and they work like a charm. The staff was a lot of help.
0,"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again."
1,enjoy listening to music and getting weather update
1,Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job
1,"I decided to buy the Amazon firestick tv after already purchasing firestick based on the fact that firestick tv box is 4K quality . And it does not disappoint ! If you have a better picture quality tv , definitely recommend the higher quality firestick tv to get the best picture possible ;-)"
1,"I have purchased several kindle fires over the years for kids and family members and am always very happy with the product. The new, lower price just makes them more appealing."
1,The screen is sharp and response is good. Set up is easy
1,Bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew. It works great and is lightweight & super portable.
1,"Very powerful book! Regardless of the no. of books I purchased, I only carry 1 small, light unit!"
1,"Alexa is fabulous. Just ask her anything and she will answer right away. She can order a pizza, turn on your lights and order an uber. Better than a secretary."
1,Love my Echo. I look forward to new apps as they become available. I especially enjoy the daily greetings and the timers which really come in handy when cooking.
1,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! She uses it much more than her iPad for reading it's easier on the eyes.
1,It is much faster than the firestick and much higher quality picture.
1,I purchased 3 tablets as gifts for family members. The price was great and the quality is outstanding. The video and sound are impressive for the value. Wonderful tablet at a low price.
1,I love the options that you have with the fire box over other like products.
1,Great product. The future of reading is paperless!
0,No bad for the price. The bad is the got too many adds an you can't take it out
1,This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics.
1,really like the fire tv works great. def an upgrade from the apple tv
1,Bought as presents for the grand-kids. Perfect size for them...perfect price for us. Win Win
1,"Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!"
1,Great for things I need it for and is easy to store and put in my purse
1,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.
1,"I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter. The camera, space, and design work perfectly for her. She loves it!"
0,"Reading a book, it's great. Working with PDF files, not so great. Also please be aware that Amazon Customer Service will treat you like a pariah because you purchased this Kindle from Best Buy instead of directly through their store."
1,"I like my Amazon Echo because it can tie in with my NEST Thermostat and I can control the temperature both at my house and at my store with a simple voice command. I also like asking Alexa random questions to see what she knows. I like the fact that she learns more the longer you have her. There are some things that it seems like she should know, but doesn't yet. I know she's still learning, heck, so am I!"
1,"FireTV box is a lot better than the FireStick...Awesome device, just had an issue with one firestick freezing up a lot but was easily returned when i brought it back to the store. no verification was needed and they exchanged it for a new one. I use them to have Kodi on them and i have a total of 4 in different rooms. They do freeze up sometimes when running a big build or a big app on them which gets annoying... then i use the FireTV which is better and can handle more than the stick can."
1,Nice little reader that is well built and I really like the backlight!
1,Was such a hit had to buy my niece one as well but we're sold out everywhere after Christmas
1,The Kindle Fire HD 8 is great for users of all types!
1,Great product. She uses it everyday. Super light and easy to navigate.
1,You get what you p ay for and more for this tablet. I would only go with a kindle or an ipad and who wants to pay 4-6 times as much when kids are hard on things.
1,"Got this as a present for my son. He likes to read and watch shows in youtube. For his age, i think this is perfect. It does the same as ipad mini."
1,"Awesome device, no cable for...one in every room, plug and play"
1,This product works great and you can speak right to the remote of what you want
1,I love my Echo. This is actually the second one I purchased. I use it to set timers and alarms. We also use it to play music for our son and when family comes over to provide some background music.
1,I love my kindle fire but wanted this for reading outside and on the beach. It is perfect!
1,My son has a 1st gen iPad and some of the newer games won't work for that operating system. I wanted a decent tablet that could play those games without locking up and not be as expensive. Amazon came through with this great product to meet my needs.
1,"It is great for reading, but that's about it. There are ads that are quite annoying as well as the slow speed of the device."
1,Perfect for my busy family. We can all watch shows and without having to watch them the day they run. Lots of extras and easy to use.
1,"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice activation, but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it."
1,Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
1,"I was replacing a first generation kindle. I love the slim size and the improved access to the internet, amazon underground and my library. The ads do not bother me once I open my kindle"
1,Makes reading books easier. I love it! User friendly too!
1,"Very hard to setup, but once thats done it works remarkably well."
1,We have loved our echo. We play music on it daily and use it as an alarm clock in the morning
1,"I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!"
1,Lightweight e-reader with backlight. Works as advertised.
1,Wow - bought this on Black Friday. The quality of construction is fantastic. The display is really good. I bought an RCA Tablet at Walmart in 2014- this absolutely blows it away. Display is good. Apps are good. Maybe a little slow ( not laptop fast) but over all speed is satisfactory. Definitely recommend. I'd buy at full price and still be impressed.
1,I bought this tablet (for $39!) on Black Friday to download a few little games and play. Does a great job for that!
1,This is perfect for my 2 year old. I love the option for 2 accounts...the kid account is very streamline.
1,I think this is the best table for reading books and just browsing the net.
1,"Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!"
0,This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes. They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.
1,This was a gift for our daughter. We have downloaded movies and game to it for road trips. She loves it. Super fast. It works great. Picture is beautiful! Get it if you like good electronics on sale!
1,"I'm not sure who needs more experience...Alexa or me. After one month, The Echo has been a little fickle. At times it's providing excellent service in answering questions, and there's other times that it doesn't understand the question. Maybe it's how we're are asking or it's not programmed to be intelligent enough. More time will tell. All in All, we're having fun with Alexa."
1,This product is very amazing it fast to answer and it does so much more...love it...
1,at first i bought this because i was tired of carrying heavy cookbooks but turns out its better suited for more novel-type books. i realized that cookbooks need to be 'flippable' -where i can just sit and flip back and forth. however this is great if you have long flights often- light and easy on the eyes. i love being able to change the brightness easily
1,This is the best thing for reading specially on the go.
1,I was glad I got it for my husband for Christmas. He play's games on it.
1,"I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite and it is really great. No glare, keeps power for a very long time, and lightweight. I love it."
1,This kindle replaces my older kindle. Love all it can do!
1,Makes any tv a smart tv! Lightning fast 4 gig processor.
1,The fire tv box simply does it all. Very fast and fun to use
1,I bought this onblack friday for $35 AND ABSOLUTELY love it. Thanks Best Buy
1,"i bought this for my daughter who is 7 yrs old, she enjoys reading,"
1,"makes me fell in love with reading again. I had an old version, the 4th generation and I didn't expect too much change with the new one. But in fact, it did make me feel total differently. The screen is much more exquisite, the whole materials is not that plastic feel any more. I just love it. The only regret is that, a few days after my made the purchase, there is the $10 saving promotion..."
1,its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it
1,Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
1,"I originally was buying one Kindle Fire for my grandson, but after reviewing specifications I decided to buy 2. I am so happy I did!"
1,Love this little device as it runs better Than other boxes. It's a simple machine that has great capability.
0,This product is real bad from amazon. Although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this was even below my expectations. Its way slow to respond to anything or everything. My 3 year old goes after my ipad when i give him this....wont recommend to anyone.
0,Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
1,"I mostly bought this to give me Amazon Prime with HDR as it was not available on my Nvidia Shield. It does a great job, and has excellent performance and speed with the menus and such. Very intuitive and easy to use. That all said, the Nvidia shield received an update today that adds Amazon Prime, so it will probably become my device of choice again."
1,Excellent product at a great price. Highly recommended.
1,"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."
1,"I had a firestick and moved it to my wifes TV. Decided to get this for the replacement. It is much more fluid, and integrates with my Alexa via the voice remote. You will like it."
1,I wanted something simple and easy to learn how to use. And it was just that.
1,"I had a 2nd generation Kindle and loved it, this one is even better. Very easy to use, great battery life and the backlight is awesome."
1,This was an upgrade from an older model. It works better in daylight.
1,"This tablet is certainly large which makes it cumbersome when reading in a reclining position. However, its terrific for reading or watching films on a plane, desk or otherwise sitting up."
1,It is a cheap tablet. It is not for you but a very good option for little kids
1,"This was a gift for my wife, and she loves it! The battery life is excellent, the resolution is great and it is light weight in her bag for the daily commute. Only knock is that it does not include a wall charger connection, just the USB cord, but that is very minor."
1,Took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawlessly with no lags in music. Doesn't have the dynamic sound range as other Bluetooth speakers i own.
1,Easy to use. Many applications. Would recommend to anyone.
1,I find the amazon fire to be just what I was looking for especially to take with me when traveling. It has great features and is easy to use.
1,"I really like the Echo, but be warned that you are still very dependent on your iPad to get the most out of your purchase, especially as it relates to music."
1,Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
1,Trying to reach the minimum required characters to get my points!
1,"Great price, great item and high quality, simple to buy on line and pick up"
1,My husband loves the fire stick .It gives all the old movies he loves and he can do amazing things with the sound as the fire stick allows many adjustments.Streaming is faster too.
1,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking."
1,Works great. Sometimes voice recognition spotty especially depending on who is talking. Key is figuring out how to integrate it with what you need or else you forget to use it
1,I bought this tablet because it was on sale and i had heard it was a good entry level tablet. It is quick on the touch response. Camera is decent but not the best. Its good to view videos.
0,"I got this for my 6 yr old son, I was looking to get him the Samsung tab 4 but this was a great deal less money. It works for the things he does."
1,My kids have really enjoyed this tablet. This makes car rides a lot easier. They both can create and learn and they love the camera.
1,I am absolutely loving the amazon fire streaming devices
1,We already had one Amazon fire tablet and liked it so much that we decided to purchase another for the grandkids to use when they come over.
1,My 9 year old and 4 year old sons love this tablet for games and watching Netflix and Hulu. Great size for them. I like the parental controls and easy to monitor their activity and how much time a day they can use it. Was a great price and able to get one each.
0,"For my 11 yr old, serves it purpose which is playing games and listening to music"
1,"I purshased this as a gift for my husband since he has Amazon Prime already, It was so easy to set up, and works great, he can check his calendar, play his music, ask her questions, get the days news report,& even get a joke for the day. Lots of fun & interesting facts. Love it"
1,It's such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I'm glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday
1,I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.
1,"Absolutely love ""Alexa""...On top of up to minute weather, traffic, news, etc.Can play all our music choices....have made her the centerpiece of our home automation system....she controls our lights, thermostat, can even lock our front door...a truly great product!!!"
1,"I purchased this to give it a try, man it is great. It's a very reliable and responsive tablet. Connects to wifi very well and doesn't have buffering issues, as of yet anyway.I set up his and hers accounts but wish I would have bought two so when we both want to use it at the same time."
1,Gift was appreciated. Very affordable. Easy to shop online and pick up at store.
1,"Great product for listening to music, weather, or researching anything."
0,"I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!"
1,Always great to upgrade new from old version when the staff is always knowledgeable
1,For the money good deal. Nice to hook up to cell phones.
0,"Fun for the first few days, but we hardly use it now after figuring out it can't answer many of our queries."
1,I really wasn't sure if I would like this thing but now I carry it everywhere and have it loaded down with ebooks to read.
1,I love it and I don't pay for cable anymore. That's winning all the way around.
1,"Bought this as a gift; I already have one and have been using it over a year. The Kindle works well, is reliable, and is easy to read in the dark."
1,A+ I would highly recommend this product. It is easy to use.
1,"the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended"
1,"The warranty is awesome, my 2 year old broke the first one. Best buy replaced it with no problems."
1,"My daughter is 1 and doesn't pay much attention to it because she'd rather have my phone. However, as a parent I'd rather have her play with the tablet because it has many free learning game apps."
1,For the price of this tablet its well worth the money very durable and works well
1,Great price for an introductory tablet. Bought for my brother in law who is not tech savvy. He has loved it. Easy to use.
1,Purchase this tablet for my brother who is handicapped. Mostly so you can watch videos off of YouTube. Pretty easy for him to understand how to use a tablet. Quality of the screen and speakers are pretty decent. Really good value for how much it costs.
1,Love our Echo. It has great sound quality. Very helpful with conversions when baking.
1,Awesome for the price! Highly recommended for anyone looking for tablet. Easy to use.
1,"I love my Paperwhite, I go no where without it! I love it so much more now that I have a waterproof case to keep it in."
1,"My son is constantly distracted and loves technology. Him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble."
1,I enjoy this product. So easy to attach and use by all
1,Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.
1,We are all taking advantage of my husband gift.. very useful.
1,My friend tell me to buy this and I was a little curious and it's a great box for the TV
1,"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
1,Great little tablet once you get the hang of it. I bought this for my wife and she uses it daily without any issues.
1,I like the functionality of the Echo and how easy it is to use. The major downfall for me is not being able to synchronize with Apple calendar as it only allows for Google calendars to sync. I also like that I can tell Alexa to add things to my shopping list or play different kind of music. Overall is a God purchase.
1,"I'm liking this tablet more and more, the more I use it. Great battery life. Easy to use."
1,"I bought this for my husband, he loves his kindle. It is very easy to read outside in direct sunlight. We have had others in the past and could not see outside in the sun. He brings this to the beach and it is perfect."
1,I like the Fire TV much better than the Fire Stick.
1,Great tablet for my 8year old son. Reliable and durable for this age group!
1,I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed.
1,"Love the Echo! Listen to music, weather, and my shopping list!"
1,"This Kindle is amazing. It is extremely readable in any condition, bright lights or dark. The auto dimming function is super and the size and weight is amazing."
1,Very easy to use and the battery life last long on this this tablet. I am very happy that I purchased this item:)
1,"I'm already enjoying reading using a paper white, this purchase was for my granddaughter. It has all the functions I need. One of the best things is the length of the battery, It only needs charged once a month. I know she'll enjoy her paper white as much as I do mine."
1,"This product is easy to set up, the interface is simple to learn and navigate. The remote has voiced activated commands for control of the TV box. The cost of this unit is much less than similar units!"
1,"Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger."
1,everyday this thing gets better! Great speaker quality and sound. The ever growing list of commands and functions ensure lagging interest and usability!
1,easy to install. very nice but hopefully it will be cheaper.
1,"I love this device. User friendly, excellent performance. Way faster than stick version. And not limited like the Apple. I enjoy it!"
1,great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
1,Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.
1,"Good device, use it often, wish I would have waited for a sale. Otherwise, works well, I've been using this more and more, especially given the rising costs of cable. If you can wait until the next day to catch your show, and have an HD antennae, you can say bye bye to cable bills (minus the internet, of course). Love what you can do with this, with the included remote, if you have an alexa home system set up with hubs, the voice remote can be used to control alexa. If you're looking for a cheaper version, the stick will work, but if you game at all, this is your best bet, especially with the quicker processor"
1,My 4 year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him!
1,I bought for my son to play with. He enjoys it a lot.
1,little gem does so much for such an amazing price.
1,"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
1,"Gave this as a gift to my sisters family. They love it. My brother in law isn't a computer user so he loves just being able to ask questions instead of having to ""google"" things."
1,"I am still learning how to use Echo. I often don't get answers to my questions but I think it's because I am not phrasing them correctly. I am not an Amazon Prime member and that limits what I can do on Echo. Amazon Prime members can place orders on Echo, as well as stream music through Amazon and listen to books. It got terrific reviews so I will continue to experiment with it and hopefully I will learn to love it."
1,I love the new kindle. It has many updates that make it more like a tablet. Great gaming options and is still the perfect device to read books from.
1,L8ght weight. Easy menu to use. Very easy for eldery mother to use
1,Has good sound for little speaker & good for getting information with out getting up.
1,I added to my gift card that I got for getting my iPhone SE . I already had a fire stick so I decided to try the fire tv . It has a lot less buffering than the fire stick . It also seems to operate easier and has a little more to offer than the fire stick
1,"This tablet has been perfect for my son. I actually bought 3 and my kids love it. The amazon app store has tons of free games for kids (panda, toca, etc.) my kids are 4, 5 and 10. In my opinion best cheap tablet for a family on the go. Screen is good for kids, seen no lag in performance also. Not sure about camera they never use it."
1,Good product with great value. Recommend this to all.
1,This Amazon box works better than the fire stick. 100% happy with it.
1,My 11 year old nephew actually had a tablet before I bought the kindle for his graduation. Now he only uses the kindle.
1,I bought this tablet for my 9 yrs son. He loves it. It'd the perfect size for him.
1,Alexia has been fun and very informative for our family. The grocery list feature is worth her cost. No more list to keep up with and the whole family can inform me through Alexia without forgetting to put on a paper list.
1,The Fire TV box has USB that allows PS4 controller to be connected for games and emulators. Also option to add SD card storage as well as USB. No brainer and recommended!
1,"We already had a 1st generation in the media room and a FireTV stick in the bedroom. We have the stick to my sister-in-law (which she loves) and moved the old FireTV to the bedroom and the new model to the media room. We use it for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Plex. All of which seem to run a little faster and handle .mkv and .mp4 videos much better."
1,This was a gift to an employee and they absolutely love it.
1,I can go in this place and spend hours. Best prices and quality products.
1,Have had this fine unit now for about six weeks having previously owned three other ereaders over the decade. So far it is exceptional from the others for the following reasons:1. battery life2. text clarity3. back lighting to read in limited light circumstances4. price - on sale for $1005. ease of highlighting and saving such highlights to a notes document6. light weightBelieve this reader is not able to withstand harsh handling and would recommend a sturdy cover ($8) and the care one might give something fragile as well as having importance to oneself.
1,"The tablet is very durable, and it also contains sufficient applications. Good quality."
1,bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price.
1,"not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged (me) I find it easy to work with"
1,Pretty easy to set up. It's fun and entertaining
1,Its a good product at the cost. Touch sensitivity is acceptable.
1,The Echo has great sound and is easy to use for all. I also got one for my mom and grandma and they can use it easily.
1,Fire tv is awesome!! Go get it now!! Way better then the fire stick! Also get the game remote...lots of free downloads!
1,We purchased this for me primarily as a reader. Great size in my hand. This is a first tablet for me as well. It does so much more than a simple reader. We got a second Fire for my fatherl for Christmas. It is his first tablet. He is excited to learn how to use it well.
1,Enjoy using it outside so I can continue to use my kindle no matter where I am.
1,I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.
1,My kid loves it. It's portable and convenient. I think I need one for myself.
1,I tried a few Samsung tables they were junk and I paid 4 times the price for those. this out preformed them 10 fold and was 1/4 of the cost. Still not quite an iPad but for the price there is probably nothing better. Free time for the kids is a great feature.
1,"BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FAMILY MEMBER - THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT - USER FRIENDLY - HAPPY CAMPER WITH THEIR NEW AMAZON FIRE 7"" TABLET !! :)"
1,Have some issues with library check out and Amazon.
1,Great d e vice for reading. I would still recommend a Samsung tablet.
1,"Great device to use, not essential home item but definitely a fun item to have."
1,Very happy with my purchase. The tablet works amazingly good for the price.
1,Could not believe price I got the Kindle for. Great to have when the grandchildren come to visit and want to play on it.
1,"Just the right size for e-mail, games, and surfing. Fits in most purses or backpacks. Love it!"
1,Bought this for my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas. Had so much fun asking Alexa questions when we visited. Especially useful for weather forecast before heading out for a day of sightseeing!
1,It's easy to understand the popularity of the Alexa Echo.It's a great accessory that will enhance your entertainment capabilities
1,"I have a 17"" laptop, cell phone,Chromebook and 4th grader. Adding the 7 (and 8"") Fire to the list give us the flexibility with different devices to fit our needs. My laptop is hardly ""lap"" friendly for more than 15 minutes, much as I do love it. The Fire is very user friendly and parental settings are, 'set it and forget'. The battery life is another huge perk, out lasting most other devices on my list. Picture quality will suffice although I do prefer the 8"" Fire tablet."
1,This kindle is an upgrade from the older model I have. It's a slimmer design with a nice purple color.
0,I have yet to figure out what page of the book I am on. Don't really care what percent of a book is left or that I have 5 minutes left in a chapter. After using a Nook for many years this is cumbersome. Good news: way easier to get library books on this.
1,"I am an Amazon Prime member and decided to take advantage of Prime Video and Prime Music. I recently ""cut the cord"" on cable and subscribed to SlingTV. Amazon Fire TV works great with SlingTV and many other apps listed in the description. The menu design is simple and easy to use. It is a great purchase and you can get even more out of your Amazon Prime membership with the Amazon Fire TV"
1,We purchased our 2nd Amazon Echo for another part of the house because we like it so much. We can play all of our music and radio subscriptions. Plus there's a lot more.
1,"I love the fact that you can go on line, browse titles, make a selection and have the book immediately. No travel to a book store, no waiting for online ordered books to arrive. Kindle purchases are available immediately upon purchase... Back lighting is excellent and the ability to adjust font size is great. Holds a charge for a couple of weeks of moderate reading. Definitely a good product."
1,"I was looking for a simple tablet, to be able to play a few games, read e-books, and such. It's not as fast or sophisticated as an iphone, or ipad, but it's simple to use and nice to read a book, or several on. I'd recommend for budget-minded users, who don't mind being tethered to wifi."
1,Absolutely love it. Its small and you can read outside with it. It's a great buy.
1,Love the feel of it and love the page turn buttton.
1,I like u can add more memory it's faster then the 1st gen picture quality is even better
1,We've had this tablet for about a month and have no complaints. Great tablet for a kid with lots of storage for games!
1,For the price tag of $59 bucks u can't go wrong....
1,"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time."
1,My kids love asking random questions and it's been alot of fun.
1,Bought this for my 2 year old since he broke his portable DVD player. The only think I don't like is i had to sneakily download the google App Store so I could install vudu on it.
1,"We were looking for an affordable, quality tablet - and this did the trick! We are Fire fans!"
1,"Has kid timers to limit your child's time using the tablet. Fun camera for kids with ""stickers"". My kids love it!"
1,"This is my second kindle purchase for a child under 5 years old. It's the most functionally and practical tablet. My first kindle is still working fine and my daughter has had it for 4 years now and it has grown with her. My kids love them, and I also received one for myself as a gift so we now have 3 in our household and none of them have been damaged at all. Despite how clumsy my children can be. I highly recommend the kindle!!"
1,"Love it! Use it mostly for music, and it has a great sound. Highly recommend!"
1,For the price it's a great tablet for a kid to start off with.
1,"This is a nice little tablet for many purposes. You can browse the net, play games with friends, map out your trips, or find a nice cozy little corner and read a book."
1,can't beat the price. thinking of buying a second one for myself as this was for my wife
1,"you get what you pay for, great little device for very cheap. this would have been a high end tablet a few years ago. to get one for sub 100 and not have it be a p.o.s. tablet from some no name branch is amazing. i use it as an ereader, for games, for second screen when watching movies or playing xbox, etc. great battery, included ads are unobtrusive, really only notice them when they appear on unlock screen or when it makes book recommendations. none of which i mind to save fifteen bucks on the unit. highly recommend. if you lose it or it breaks you barely spent anything on it and just get another one. the microsd support is really nice too"
1,This device works great! Can't wait to get more items to sync with it!
1,"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
1,I am very impressed with this set-up. I purchased as a cheaper replacement of an apple product and it does exactly the same thing.
1,Works better than I anticipated.....now I don't need ambient light. Easy to use and read.
0,"Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless"
1,"Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
1,"I haven't had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money."
0,Good starter tablet. Best used as a book reader. Not really for business use
1,Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
1,"I did my research before I bought this and there have been no surprises. I wanted a nice easy screen to read, and a good battery. The paperwhite has both. For the price it is hard to beat this device."
1,"I like this reader. It is very easy to load books onto it, even from my local library. It's easy to adjust the font and size. It keeps track of your place in the book. You can choose what language you want the dictionary in which makes it great to read something in a foreign language. You can set it up so that when you select a word, it will give you the translation."
1,Neat device does not answer all questions though .
1,"No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
1,"She can put items you need onto your grocery list. You can asss things to your to do list. She can tell jokes, facts, read books, find music, and more"
1,It's a good tablet that serves many functions. Amazon is a great brand!
1,I upgraded from an old kindle. It's really nice to have the backlight and slightly larger screen.
1,Received as a gift. Questions have to be asked in a certain way to be answered correctly. The sound is awesome. I can connect my iPhone by bluetooth to play music.
1,"I used to read with my ipad , but there was always a glare in the car and even in my house when the sun was coming in the window. The Paperwhite takes care of all glare problems I had, so now I can read whenever and wherever I want."
0,This table is okay for me. But it is great for kids
1,I am having a great time with Alexa and look forward to expanding her capabilities.
0,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size."
1,"I loved everything about my kindle paperwhite but then while reading the other night I swiped to turn the page and nothing happened. It froze after using it for about two years, give or take a couple of months. I've tried restarting it but it does not shut off. I advise you also buy the extended two year warranty or just go back to reading real books."
1,"I wasn't looking for a new tablet when I saw this one for $40. With its capability, I couldn't pass it up. It's perfect for eReading, my kids can play games on it, and it functions great. It won't be a replacement for my iPad 3, but it serves it purpose well."
1,This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
1,"great size to take everywhere and super fast, good battery life"
0,This device is not as great as advertised. It does not do as many things as expected and you have to go to a lot of trouble to do otherwise
0,"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone"
1,I am enjoying Alexa/Echo. I mostly use it for listening to music and podcasts. I have begun using it for internet calls which are fun to use for hands free calling.
1,Great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. Accident proof bumper a big plus!
1,I enjoy this tablet. Since I am an Amazon customer it was fairly easy to set up once I entered my amazon ID.
1,Bought 2 of these for my younger girls for travel. It is great. Only downfall was low storage but that was fixed by adding additional memory card.
1,Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it
1,"Purchase echo as a gift. Owned mine for over a year and still learning from it..Planning on teaming it up with a couple of dots, great tchnology."
1,"Purchased the tablet for my niece as a replacement for a stolen one of a different brand. Easy to use, set up and connect. Great application selection. Best of all is the affordability with all you get."
1,"We only used this camera for a couple weeks but it does its job. Is not slow or anything.. If you need it for reading or watching videos, or only for one thing at time is great."
1,"The Fire is very much so as it's slogan suggests, a sensible tablet. Inexpensive and versatile, highly recommend"
1,Got this as a gift. We have really enjoyed listening to different music and radio stations.
1,I purchased this for my kids and it works great with time limits.
1,"I bought this to help my 88 year old mother, along with a dot. It is amazingly,easy to use, voice activated, and multi functional. It provides extra safety and daily we find more tricks to enable with it. Unlike apps you enable functions ( all free and built in). A must have for seniors!"
1,"Love this box, plenty of power for my 60in tv, beautiful picture and sound. Key features for me were the internet hardline even though the wifi in this unit works great and the usb. Easily add on a usb keyboard to make your experience that much better."
1,"Great sound quality, and with Amazon Prime, great selection. Of music."
1,"its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
1,Very impressive. Works just as advertised. So very easy to set up
1,This was a great buy it does everything a laptop or desk top without the big bulk.
1,This is a well built great sounding unit that gets better the more you use it.
1,"Love this! It has added such simplification to my daily routine! I can update my grocery list on the fly. My daughter loves to ask questions that assist her with her homework, etc. And the fact that we love to jam out and listen to music all the time, this is rockin cool! Altogether, it was a great purchase! And since I got it on sale, that makes it even better!"
1,this is the best tablet on the market for a really great price and even has Alexa access
1,"Able to read book and use apps like Netflix. Feels slow when you are used to using an ipad, but obviously there is a big price difference."
1,"Use my fire tv daily, it is upgrade to the fire stick, we love it."
1,Alexa is very fun and helpfull. I do wish she could search and understand better. You have to ask questions the correct way. But still fun for kids and helpful around the house for shopping and music.
1,"My first tablet. OUTSTANDING for NETFLIX, email, etc."
1,great for movies.Works better with a bluetooth mouse
1,"easy to use and just the right size, love the ease of operating the device, small enough to carry around. still access all my favorites"
1,Can't go wrong great for games wifi great overall very happy
1,"The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
1,"I am having so much fun with my Echo, from playing music to asking her questions like the weather to asking her to tell me a dumb joke."
1,"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
1,I am very happy with this purchase. My kids love it and find it very easy to use.
1,I have several sticks and they eventually get glitchy and need to be rebooted. The box never does this. It also runs faster and responds better at all times. Get the box not the stick.
0,"This product is okay, but does not due what a normal tablet can due. Example, social media such as instagram and snapchat are not accessible on this tablet due to it being an amazon product. Had I known that, I would not have purchased it."
1,"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
1,"We love our echo, not sure we use all the features yet but the shopping list feature is great as is all the different music we can now listen to!"
1,purchased for Kodi and 1st time setup was little bit time taking process. after that everything good.. getting 4k resolution and flexible to carry anywhere.. buffering is good when you connected through internet cable instead of wifi
1,Amazon Echo is amazing. It works perfectly in my room. Does the job done.
1,"Have this device set up in my kitchen area. I use it to control my back porch lights, play music through bluetooth, keep a timer when grilling, etc. Very versatile device that allows you to do something cool things when paired with wifi plugs and other things."
0,Can not print from this device...Using the touch screen is very difficult.
1,I wouldn't recommend buying this tablet for personal use
1,Our family isn't from Ohio so when we travel back home we like to have something for the kids to do. I didn't want something super expensive because of course theyre 3 and 5 so not the most responsible. These worked perfectly fine for them.
0,"pretty slow, but for the price i guess it works ok"
0,I purchased 3 (2 as gifts) recently believing all prior purchases would be compatible with the Paperwhite. I was highly disappointed to learn that interactive solitaire and word games I played on the old Kindle Touch were lost.
1,the Amazon Echo does many things now with the potential of so much more in the future. It's providing great information every day.
1,"Upgraded my wife's original 7"" Fire to this one and she is very happy. Much faster, better battery life and better cameras. Didn't bother with the 16gb for $30 more as you can just add a micro sd card for cheaper and greater capacity"
1,Purchased as a gift for a family member who just wanted to be able to watch videos and play games while his wife shopped. Wonderful beginner tablet and no issues so far. Very user friendly.
1,Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi
1,So easy to use and my parents just love it and use it all the time!
1,I got this for my grandson and he loves it.He has not had any problems at all!
1,"Got it for my husband to read at night in bed, he loves that it has a lit screen unlike the original model. However he can't read his textbooks from school so that is a big negative."
1,Good for kids to have some nice fun and entertainment . Liked it
1,I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you
1,No reason to shop around at this price there is something for everybody I bought 3 at black friday price for gifts no complants!
1,Great product. This is the best streaming box out there besides the Nvidia Shield TV but much more affordable. I'm thinking of getting another one.
1,I love this thing!!!!!So much better then my nook.
1,For the price hands down best tablet out there. Excellent for reading in bed without disturbing your partner thanks to the blue shade mode.
0,Good if use of tablet is low and not very complex. Color quality is only average.
1,Purchased this for my child who's in his terrible 2s! As you can imagine he has thrown the tablet around but with the protective case the tablet has survived. Overall He's really enjoying it. It's a little slow and he can get impatient but it works a lot better than most tablets. It doesn't have the greatest camera but it's good enough for a toddler. Overall it's a very decent tablet for a child!
1,"Bought it for my daughter, she loves it. Can't put it down. Great product"
1,The best product we have been pleasantly surprised
1,"The Amazon Echo is simply awesome. It plays music of your choice. It will tell you about the weather, give traffic updates, tell you jokes. Even tell you about planets. If you have an Amazon stick or tv. It will change channels or even pull up the shows you watch. You can even ask to turn on lights or change their colors and if you have ADT Pulse, you can arm/disarm your system. Amazon Echo is always learning. I don't know what I would do without her... Yeah it's a her and her name is Alexa. Once you have one... you will understand."
1,"Works great with Kodi, enough power to direct play h265. SD card slot is a bonus for apps and USB for external media. Threw my Roku away."
1,The Echo is a great device to have around the house. Ask questions & Alexa answers.
1,Love having the Echo for listening to music and using it to turn my lights on and off by voice with Phillips Hue lighting system.
1,"This is what e-readers should be like. Page turning is quick, the backlight is amazing. Reading in bed at night is perfect with this. I take it with me everywhere."
1,Actually brought it for a friend but I kind of use more than they do. Excellent product
1,thanks for an excellent transaction
1,"I bought it for my mom and it is perfect. It recharges quickly and was very cheap and effective. Nothing fancy but sturdy and gets the job done, like the San Antonio spurs."
1,I have to get a case for him but I was able to set this one up for Free Time. I have it set for time frames of the week and weekend he can play. I also was able to make it where he can't play games until he has completed 45 mins of reading.
1,Love it and works pretty good for what i wanted for
1,"This device is such an excellent streaming product that will let you unlimited movies, tv shows and more!!!"
1,"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
1,"This tablet is actually a surprisingly effective device, given its price point and performance, and definitely exceeded my expectations!"
1,"Great tablet, with lots of apps and good games for playing."
1,"I am definitely a book person, but this is really convenient for travel!"
1,I love having all of my streaming videos in one place and log on his single remote!
1,Great tablet for my six year old. And I the parental controls.
1,"I have enjoyed having the ability to watch almost any movies that I would like to see. This even includes movies that are being shown in the theaters at that time. Occasionally we have hit some streaming that tends to pause the show, but mostly we can find a go around by choosing another streaming!"
1,Great! Plays all my favorite music and news hands off
1,all i can say it is awesome she was watching movies on her phone now she watch them on her tablet
1,love my kindle the store was clean and well laid out.
1,"Very functional, easy set-up and great so be quality."
1,The product was easy to setup and use. I really like it.
0,Price was right. Bought it mostly to be able to watch movies but the quality of the movies is not as good as I had hoped which is the main reason behind my average rating.
1,This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
1,"If looking to get an all in one box, this one works great!"
1,I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games.
1,This product is wonderful. If your looking for a way to get rid of cable this is the way to go.
1,i originally purchased for 3 year old and it is great especially at this price i love the free amazon apps and the clarity of the tablet i just dont like the app arrangement and slideview app type
1,Bought this for my son with a 32gb memory. He uses it for school and play.
0,it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
1,"Same great reliable tablet as the three other Fire 7"" tablets I purchased previously for my kids. Now we can actually tell them apart! The tablets, I mean."
1,So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!
0,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
1,Bought one last year for a Christmas gift and it is amazing. So I bought 2 more this year for gifts and they loved them.
1,The amazon echo is an amazing home automation system!! Works GREAT!! SOund is incredible !! bluetooth works flawlessly!
1,"If the fire stick is great, this is even better. Much faster too. I use Kodi on it an I love it."
0,I don't recommended if you are using Apple products
1,bought the amazon fire to watch PlayStation vueso far so good
1,It was a hard choice between high priced echo vs the cheaper dot but I chose the echo. I do like having the speaker internal and I will be able to add the dot later on to other places. You can download apps to have alexa more adjustable to you
1,"Does exactly what you wanted to, very nice looking seems to be a solid product"
1,"Who knew you could ask a smart device (other than our phone) sitting on your table the weather, play whatever music you want, last nights final sport scores etc and you get a pleasant reply promptly. A fun gadget for todays lifestyles."
1,Fast shipping from bestbuy.Com. product works great. For the price you can't go wrong.
1,The echo is a great add on for a smart home. It has good microphone range so it could pick up your voice from afar. The speaker isn't bad either. It provides a decent quality sound.
0,"My elderly uncle is pleased to have his device. He's still not real sure about how to use it, but happy he has one."
1,bought this for my 2yr old and he loves it. great price for the features
1,Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
1,Love it!! I have had other readers and this is the best one by far!
1,I have no complaints what so ever. Great Item. recommended
1,Works great! Seems to do most everything as advertised. I personally believe it will work best when the user kinks are out and when said user knows the proper commands & has the proper hookup/applications and necessary accounts. Get past the learning curve and the sky is the limit.
1,My firebox is connected with my verizon internet and plays excellent movies.
1,My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away
1,"Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand."
1,Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
1,Great every one should have one or two or three will buy another one if was now shopping very easy to use and set up with Alexa helping you thru voice called customer service 10
1,Really enjoy the great speaker and music on demand by just asking Alex. Great buy!
1,This is the reading machine I will recommended for everyone. The sharp font and responsiveness is unparalleled
1,Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
1,Would prefer hardware buttons and wish you could access public library digital book. Other than that works great in the dark.
1,The battery life is amazing and quickly gets a full charge
1,It was a nice gift to give for the price.the person looked it to add to rest of Amazon products.
1,Very easy to use but lags bad. Would recommend the box.
1,love it best purchase so far this year better than the wifi fire stick
1,Great buy for my money great quality and durability
1,Great for all ages...have our own - 2 and bought this also as a gift. Great value for a great lasting product!
1,Bought the Kindle fire for reading and for my kids gaming apps. Very user friendly with quick and easy access to amazon shopping
1,I wanted something simple for my Mom to use and this is perfect for her.
1,Lots of apps and also has Alexa built in. Great HD picture.
1,"Great for Sling TV, Vevo, YouTube, etc. Must have."
1,"So many great things to say. This product is awesome and can be configured to do so many things. I use it for my morning briefing of hot news, sports and weather. I also use her to turn on/off my theater system and NEST thermostat. Would highly recommend. Even the novice can configure and use this prodcut. You are only limited by your imagination. Just do your homework. There are many many automation options. You need to figure out the best brands and products for your lifestyle."
1,I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it.
1,"I had 2 other tablets that worked terrible. It wouldn't even take e-books from the Library! But this is the perfect balance between an e-reader that could get boring to some people, & a tablet, that uses up the battery real quick. And you don't have to connect to a computer to download the e-books either, which is a real convenience!! So I would have to say this cute little tablet is really a lifesaver for a lot of really Poor people, that can't afford to buy expensive electronics. If they lose it, breaks. or gets stolen, they could easily just go buy a brand new one. The goal is to stay connected to the mainstream. It is easy to carry on the bus, bring to the park, maybe a classroom, or library, dining room, coffee shop. And not a big worry about losing a lot of $, if it got lost. Plus, with the ""Amazon Cloud"", You would never lose any of the e-books, that you paid for, & can use on all you devices. This should be considered a Gift-package from Amazon, especially for new people that never had a chance to own their very Tablet, & always have to run to the library, or borrow someone else's. Penny"
1,"Love this product! I use it everyday to listen to my music, ask Alexa what time it is, and how is the weather. Some of the things it does not pick up such as some of the restaurants or places that I'm looking. I wasnt really happy about that but I'm hoping there's a software upgrade or something that will fix it. Thats the only reason i'm giving four stars rating."
1,Exceeds my expectations. Great fun for the whole family. Daily jepordy is lots of fun!. Add the nest thermostat and light controls and you won't be sorry.
1,Purchased two of these as Christmas gifts. Both individuals love them. Has been used constantly since received. Great size for holding in your hand easily.
1,"It's a basic tablet for $50. What's not to like. I purchased this to read on, and it's great for that."
1,ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok
1,"Alexa can do almost everything & is constantly learning & that's just the app. The echo itself is fantastic speaker when player music. It's almost lifelike & is seems to be like the Star Trek shipboard computer. Its great for the kids of any age to help with homework. Its great to take notes, create shopping list, music, or questions of any kind. In fact it'sgreat for most anything... It's simply awesome"
1,"I bought this for my dad because he loves to read but, sometimes, it's difficult to get to the library in the Winter. So far, he's loving it."
1,Good quality & worth the price!! We are happy!!!!!
1,Got it on sale for $34.99 so I can say I got more than my moneys worth so far so good.
1,I initially purchased Nvidia Shield TV but returned it in favor of Fire TV. The driving factor was the apps and it has everything you need.
1,"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading"
1,"I love having music whenever I want it plus the convenience of asking Alexa to order something or help me with a question. I received my Echo the day after I ordered it. Best Buy, you're the BEST!"
1,It is an amazon amazing among many things that can be used by many people and always will be a good product to use for many people to tryout and have an important experience for their family. Amazon Kindle fire 16gb with side that has slot for the extra memory in the form of a memory chip.
1,Bought this for my daughter after her old one was broken when it got folded up in the sofa bed. Don't ask. Lol. She loves it! Light weight. Holds a charge for a long time. Easy to use.
1,"My son has always like the idea of a smart home. While that isn't in our future, having Alexa in his room makes him feel like he can walk into his room and request music or have a question answered like he is sone sort of Tony Stark lol. Great buy!"
1,"We are really enjoying our purchase of this tablet. I bought it for my 7-year old, my husband, and myself to use. The kid-friendly controls are appreciated. When needed, we just log in as me to access the wilds of the internet that are kept from her when she is logged in. Speedy, friendly, and very nice screen. I am going to add internal memory and then we will be set!"
1,"A good value for the price, easy to use, like the size and weight of the product."
1,bought for my grand daughter and she loves it. She likes to read and this is great for that

1,"Hard to beat, especially during Black Friday at $35. Meets the needs."
1,"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed."

1,"Perfect if you just want to check email, Facebook, apps - works great."
1,"This little guy is great at what it does, it lets me read lol, holds more books that I'll ever need and it just works"
1,"I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy."
1,"My 5 y.o. and 2y.o have been using theirs for more than a year now: all kind of dropping and throwing and stepping on, these tablets are still working perfectly! So i get one every time i want to give presents to young ones!"
1,"Bought this for my 3rd grader when her school suggested to parents to get a tablet, they use them occasionally in school. This inexpensive one fits the bill just fine."
1,I bought 5 of these for the kids for Christmas Easy to set up Work perfectly
1,"Awesome experience...my friend Chris Fields works at BB...I went in for 1thing & with Chris there, I bought 4 items. Extremely helpful.. I'll shop more now coz he can answer any of my questions. I adore BB."
1,Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!
1,"I love the Echo, I recently bought it for my husband. Until I had to get my own, We love it, I even bought the Echo Dots."
1,Easy to use in kids mode. Lots of games and books for the kids
1,This Kindle is exactly what my wife wanted and has worked out wonderfully.
1,This is great starter tablet for tweens and mature adults. The only issue I have is the forced ads on the homescreen.
1,Great for my daughter and my mom they love it!!!!!
1,Awesome product. Got 2 of them. No issues with streaming.
1,"I absolutely love, love, love my echo!! Simple to set up, great sound quality."
1,"At first the kindle launcher was super annoying. But once i rooted and installed nova launcher, this thing is great. For 33.00 i should have bought 5 of these."
1,Wanted to Start my 6 & 7 year olds with a small tablet because they claimed their to big for a regular kids tablet. This was perfect for them... The picture quality is awesome.
1,I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
1,So pleased to have invested in this 4th Kindle....
1,"Listens to my requests. Listen to pandora, reads me jokes answers my question."
1,A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. Great deal on a great product.
1,"The product is great once you download everything you need. I found it a little challenging taking it from place to place. It must connect to Wi-Fi to work and be loaded with the music you want to hear. It's great for your favorite spot in your home or office, then download songs, and don't move it."
1,I love the 7 inch Kindle fire. Great graphics and easy to handle and read from!
1,Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend.
1,"I am a huge fan of the echo. That being said this is the last one I would buy. The original echo's speaker sounds much better and is hands free. The dot has great connection Bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system. I bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard. The sound is not as robust as the original echo (not portable - no internal battery), but good enough when in the yard to at least have music."
1,This Alexa is a super form of info with little wait time.
1,Love it for the price paid. Perfect holiday gift for kids and adults.
0,"Logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown, even temporarily, so inadvertent typos require guesswork to find.Signing out of e-mail is not clear, if it can be done.Some ""free"" downloads fail because of lack of payment.Allowing for my lack of skills. I was hoping for a little more.It was OK fort basic stuff."
1,"I was looking for a tablet for my five-year-old daughter found a tablet on my Walmart for $40. When we opened it and tried to set it up The Wi-Fi was not working. I spoke with a coworker it indicated he bought an Amazon fire tablet for his child. I was shocked to find that it was the same price as the one I had already purchased. I returned the original and bought this one. It is packed full of ads and amazon specific programs, but I guess there is a reason it is so cheap!! My daughter loves it, does everything she wants and more!!!"
1,"After struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an e-reader. I never wanted one, because I previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. He was pretty convincing, so I went online and researched a few different ones. I settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. I wanted the Voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but I opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, I don't think I'd use the buttons, even if I had them. I am already halfway through my first book, and I've had this less than 24 hours. I'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! I tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read- no glare. I also used it while working out today- it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. I am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! I am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!"
0,Doesn't answer as many questions as led to believe should have google instead of Bing a simple alarm clock is all I use it for not much good for anything else would have returned it but I like gadgets . Don't recommend purchasing
1,Alexa is a very good tool to have in homes. The only thing is that sometimes we have to repeat questions.
0,"to spite the fact that i have nothing but good things to say about amazon and anthing i've ever gotten from them. and that i love my fire. i find it greedy that the wall charger doesn't come with the kindle. not everyone, ok most people, but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into. i'm taking my charger back. i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free, or credit those who had to buy one."
1,I got this to replace my Apple TV and I am not disappointed.
1,"Thanks to Amazon for standing behind the product they sell, mine quit working after a year and replaced it. GREAT!"
1,"Light weight, charge lasts for upto a week and can read pretty much anytime of the day indoor or outdoor ... very happy to have this e-reader"
1,This kindle fire is great for the price. I love that you can add more storage for even more apps and pictures.
1,I got this for a Christmas gift for my daughter. This is the second one I have gotten for her.The first one is starting drop words and she has to download books several times in order to finish reading. She diid a lot of research before she asked for the Paperwhite. I am sure she will love it.o
1,Easy to set up it adds entertainment while cooking
1,I love my echo use it every day for questions to recipes to weather and games
1,Bought for my son for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use for a beginner
1,"I bought one once before for my mother and this product is amazing. I recently bought another to replace my girlfriend's Nook. Is amazing how good this e-readers performs, the battery life and versatility."
1,"For the price, this is very worth the money. Would be great if they increase the minimum storage to 16G."
1,love these. i have two in my main home + a dot and a remote control.
1,"My 3 year old is learning so much playing the games on this tablet, and I love that it is so durable and can take a beating. Would recommend. Many games to match many age groups. Plus YouTube access."
1,Love the fire stick. And the price wad the best price compared to other stores
1,Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.
1,Grandkids loved it the perfect xmas present for ages 5 to 15
1,I bought this for my son and ended up leaving with one for myself! For a $50 tablet I can't complain it does what it says and has expendable memory my son loves his and I'm satisfied with mine.
1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister, and she can't put it down. Battery life is great, and she has found so many great books to read at great prices, and even some free titles she is excited to start reading. It is smaller than I expected, but that makes it easier to take on trips."
1,I love this kindle! I like the fact that it has a great feature that the background is lit up. Had the originial and this one tops it.
1,My sons nook battery was going out this cost less than just replacing the battery and is highly recommended by family members
1,"I thought this would just be a fun novelty but it isn't. Set up was a snap and i located it centrally in our home via WiFi. No problem at all and it worked the first time. I have a Kindle Fire tablet and that does help a bit in management. Once set up i then added skills and even used IFTT. So now, i have a flash briefing with news i am interested in, my WEMO lights are controlled by voice as well as WEMO app, i listen to my music, i get the weather information, my family listens to jokes and much more."
1,"My wife and I love the echo. Music, facts, answers, all there for the asking."
1,"The Amazon Fire TV has been a great addition. It is extremely convenient to have Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu all easily accessible in the same place!"
1,Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
1,I bought this for my step mom who likes playing solitaire. She wore her hand held game out and couldn't find a replacement. She just loves it and can do a lot of other things on it.
1,This fire tv loads content quicker and without hesitation compared to it predecessor. Love the micro sd slot to offload games to to save space
1,Got this kindle for a gift for Christmas and my mom loves it. I would suggest this for any avid book reader tons of books and tons of possibilities.
1,"The Amazon fire stick is everything that I expected and more. I loved the pricing and the fact that all fire sticks are voice activated. Easy to navigate through 1000,s of free movies and games."
1,So many products on the market. This by far is saving me almost $250 a month on my Comcast bill!
1,"After reading the reviews I was very skeptical. I mainly use Apple products, but with 5 kids and apple out of my price range this was perfect. I was able to get 4 tablets for the price of 1 Apple iPad. The kids love and they don't mind the commercial. I like that I can manage their fire tablet via my phone and I get emails for everything they download. This was perfect for them. And I would buy it again."
1,"My granddaughter loves to play games on this tablet. At the same time she can look for information on internet for her school homework. Another think I like about it, is that you can use an sd card for extra storage. It's very user friendly!"
1,This tablet works great for my 7 year old son. He loves it. The app store has plenty of apps. I would recommend.
1,I myself have never used it but my grandson does all the time. He said the voice activation works very good and he likes it a lot. He's going on 8 years old and knows all about it.
1,Love the Kindle great for my children...and also for my older kids
1,"Wanted to upgrade from a fire stick, so much faster. Upgraded processor, more ram, and Ethernet makes a big difference."
0,"There is not enough battery life to read comfortably. 7 hours, maybe."
1,"Amazon Fire is a great product. We did have trouble with the remote after a long while, but Amazon was able to help and the App works great"
1,Works great!! My brother loved it. It's easy to use!
1,We like this product. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,My Kindle is great for reading books. It's less useful for use on reference material where I'm frequently moving from one part of the work to another.
1,This was my first experience with amazon fire tv. Setup was simple and quick. Quality of movies was quite good. One of the best features was its integration with Slingbox. Now I can watch movies or my own content directly to my Samsung Tv. Great product.
1,Enjoy my Kindle Fire for the price. Easy to use and nice clear wording.
1,My children love this tablet. It's fun and easy for them to use!
1,This is a great little gadget for the price. It can't be beat.
1,Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online.
1,I love this unit. I'm learning new things I can do with it every day. Lately I've been using it to listen to audible purchases.
1,Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it.
1,I love the tablet everything works perfect for my boy
1,"As an existing Amazon Prime member, this is a no brainer. Has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use, at a good price."
1,Easy my kids love it....easy set up ....easy to use
1,Finds movies and shows quickly. Very easy to set-up
1,Awesome for my child as she is 2 and was bought for learning programs
1,"We love our Alexa! We use it for weather, news, music, games, timers, shopping lists, jokes..... My daughter got one after hearing us rave about it, and all of our grandchildren are getting a Dot for Christmas."
1,It actually works.. Programmed my harmony and hue lighting!!! Now only if she made coffee in the morning!!!
1,Very good tablet for this price.Its very handy.......
1,Great tv box that has a lot of capability over th competition.
1,"I love Apple, but this product is so much better than Siri, and really great for smart homes."
1,"I purchased the Kindle Fire for my mom as a Mothers Day present, and she loves it."
1,Pretty good tablet!! Memory is lacking a little bit but for the price you can't beat it. Also they are not as many apps compared to Apple or Android but again you are paying for a whole lot less for this product compared to Apple and Samsung. If you are used to the Amazon Fire product then you will like this.
1,"Bought the tablet for my niece. She loves it, a lot"
1,It can convert your regular tv into a smart tv. Awesome
1,This is our 3rd Kindle. We have 2 fires and one kids fire
1,"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ)."
1,Great sound easy to set up and use. My wife is truly enjoying it.
1,Love it! It allows me to charge it without having to plug it to a computer.
1,It's a wonderful tablet for younger kids. Parental settings and a kids mode
1,Goodbye outrageous satellite bills...hello Amazon!
0,"This tablet handles the basics including email, Facebook, web browsing and utube. No comparison to theiPad though.,"
1,I purchased one for myself a few months ago & now this one is for my husband. No glare inside or outside. It adjusts itself once I have my brightness preference set. Light weight & battery life is amazing!
1,I love Alexa! Don't tell my wife. She listens and she gives me answers without questioning my motives.
1,Very nice product. Must buy. It is a great for kids as well.
1,I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
1,I love this kindle! It's a life saver when I'm bored at the doctors office!
1,"I got this around the holidays and I'm happy with the quality of the image and videos. You may be just fine with not having as Amazon Prime membership and just use it for light web browsing. The screen gets easily smudged but for the price, it's a great value."
0,On the second day the unit disconnected from my wireless network and when attempted to reconnect the remote would not work and I could not click on the network settings button. I return that unit for another Amazon fire and the second unit could not find the remote to pair it. I think I will purchase a google or apple next .
1,I had a kindle before. This time I chose the paperwhite because there has a light and touchscreen. I really love the Kindle products. Very nice buy!
1,I found the Fire tv great and I really am satisfied I recommend it to all my friends and family
1,I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children
1,I love the back light and has lots of memory. Very compact...easy to carry.
1,Very happy with the overall design and the many options the fire has as far as the ability to assess different apps
1,"These are all true and they really are up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments, love love love."
1,I installed the echo and linked it to my ecobee thermostat and Hue lights. It took a little time but wasn't too difficult really. I have it linked to pandora for music and my favorite news station for my morning news flash. The speaker isn't the greatest for a true audiophile but it's adequate. Good product overall.
0,"had a fire HD, got this to try, spend the extra and get the HD"
1,"I was a previous Voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane (don't forget to check the seat-back pocket before you leave!). I was debating whether to buy it again but all the reviews I saw online said it wasn't worth the $80 premium - they're right.First off, the resolution is the exact same 300 ppi on both models. The Voyage does have better contrast but it's something I stopped noticing after 24 hours. The backlighting on the Paperwhite also isn't as even, as I notice it's darker on the bottom but again, I stopped caring after a few uses. The weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery lives.About the only time I miss the Voyage is when it comes to the page turn buttons. On the Paperwhite, I have to touch the screen, so when I'm lying in bed, I'm forced to use two hands to avoid it from falling on my face. With the Voyage, I could just press the page ""button"" and keep my hands on the border. Again, far from a deal breaker and something I adjusted to quickly.Overall, the Voyage is the better Kindle but not worth the premium cost."
0,Alexa answers maybe 1 out of 10 questions we ask her - she uses Bing.com and it is really bad. Her standard answer is - I don't know the answer to this question. We ask her easy questions about stats or people. We also have a Google home and it answers almost every question right.
1,"Awesome Price for a great tablet.Main use is for reading comics and internet browsing so there is nothing better i would ask for.good screen,easy set up"
1,We bought this for my mom. She is very satisfied with this product.
1,"I bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage"
1,"I bought it for my bedroom, it's great, I use it all the time"
1,Wanted a small kindle to read books and keep kids busy with games while on vacation. Great price and size. Small enough to carry in your purse or even pocket.
1,Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.
1,"I love it, easy to learn and operate. Quick response and easy to hook up."
1,"I bought this for my wife's birthday present. She absolutely loves it! It is easy to use, easy on her eyes, and she prefers it to paper. Best present I've given her this year!"
1,"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
1,l love my fire tv. liked it somuch i purchased a firestick formy other tv. i use them every day!
1,bigger screen than my iphone allots for easier viewing. So easy to use. I wouldn't go anywhere without my kindle!
1,"Amazing sound quality, many different features. Great for all music types."
1,"I love this divice, it has an amazing image, I will recomend it to any body, and ypu can install a lot of good apps"
1,Bought it to try some features. You should try sleeping sound. It really worked for me.
1,Fire TV is the best way to cut the cord with the cable company. We have Fire sticks already but the TV is much better.
1,Bought for my son. No need to worry about an expensive tablet getting broken. Best $50 I ever spent for him.
1,"Great price. Easy surfing the web, great game playing, and way to enjoy reading new books. 8 GB is large enough. I like I can purchase gifts cards to make purchases."
1,Easy to install and use! Love it. I am tired of being gouged by cable.
1,Great variety in free movies and tv to watch as well as games!
1,"The kids tablet made a good gift for our youngest grandson, 6 years of age."
1,Bought this for my granddaughter's Christmas present and she loved it.
1,"I really like the sound of the tab. The only complaint is that you have to push the button every time you have to speak or listen to tab. Unlike the echo, where you just speak and it answers without pushing any buttons. The echo has a cheaper sounding speaker. I'd wait till there is a sale in it before paying full price. Otherwise, it is just like a Bluetooth speaker."
1,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo."
1,Great sound from a small speaker. Responds well to verbal commands
1,"I wanted one for Christmas and wasn't sure whether to purchase the echo or google home. I am very satisfied. We went to our daughters house and she had a dot, loved it all weekend that on our trip home we stopped off at best buy and purchased the echo . Loved it so much I ordered two echos for friends"
1,Bought this for my husband. He loves that it is so lightweight and has the built in light.
1,Fire TV 4K version is a lot faster than the original version with a better chip set. The picture quality is excellent and navigation between apps is easy and intuitive. Also like the fact that you can load apps without a PC or Mac necessary.
1,I have fire stick for few years and using it everyday. My smart TV is less smarter than it. I don't use the smart function of the TV. I purchased fire tv month ago and I can't live without it. An excellent product from Amazon. Highly recommended.
1,We purchased and echo and a dot together and have had some minor bugs but use it to control 30 plus hue bulbs and nest thermostats. Pretty amazed. Ordered as gifts for family after my 2 month trial.
1,Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
1,"This is the greatest reader! Its super light weight, fast at downloading books and very user friendly. I have charged it once in the 2 months I have had it. Excellent battery life."
1,I am able to watch anything I want with the fire stick and it is so easy to use... I love it!
1,This product has great sound quality and easy to use. I love it and have given it as a gift twice now.
1,The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent alternative to cable and satellite prison. The amount of content available is staggering. The unit functions flawlessly.
1,"Very good speaker, echo is amazing, able to control Philips hue, and through Logitech remote, the tv as well."
1,The Paperwhite is still the best overall eReader. There is the Oasis and Voyage but they cost a lot more and are only slightly better.
1,"The newest Kindle eReader (Voyage) is a very good upgrade over the current model. It has several new hardware & coming software enhancements over the current model. However, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, I would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current PaperWhite generation. The high price does not justify it."
1,This ereader is more like a tablet or iPad but without the huge price. Loving my new tech toy.
1,"Great addition to the home can take it to various spots in the home clear sound! User friendly, and easy to sync. Set up make sure u download the App in advance"
0,"I like the price point for this tablet but for being a quad core processor, it runs kind of slow."
1,If you are up in the air between the two (fire stick and fire TV) go with the TV due to the speed alone.. The memory is also nice but you will have a more enjoyable experience with the fire TV. I have them both in my house but prefer the Fire TV...
1,"Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer"
0,"Kindle Fire is a decent tablet. The only turn off is the way Amazon has massacred the Android OS and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time. It's a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go. Other than the OS, Kindle Fire is a decent buy."
1,Completely satisfied with the Amazon Fire TV. I'll never go back to cable TV again.
1,THIS ITEMS IS READING USING IT FOR READING AND LITE SURFING
0,"Works good for my grandkids to play with when they are visiting me at my home.. I really needed to buy 3 instead of 2. Only gripe I have is the seemingly ""forced"" ads popping up, which appear to be built into it. Maybe I will learn someday how to stop them. :("
1,Amazon fire tv is the best to use with kodi app that allows you to have all the movies without any additional charge.
1,Pretty good system. Can't wait for the upgrades. Sound is superb
0,Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web
1,The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
1,Great price and easy to use. Perfect for using while traveling by car.
1,My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.
1,I love this kindle and price is awesome .My Three year boy love to play it.
1,"Got here quick, has a great speaker, and all the features are amazing and they keep adding more!"
1,"Have both the Apple TV and now the fire. Picture quality is noticeably better with fire, as advertised. The only issue is the organization of the home screen could use some work, but overall, worth the money"
1,Everyone one in my house loves the Amazon Echo. Can't wait to see what new skills will be added in the days and years ahead. Alexa is a whole lotta fun!
1,I love my amazon fire tv I take it with me everywhere I travel.
1,"I have the Chromecast as well as the Amazon Fire Stick. The Fire TV is a nice upgrade with a good remote. I have read that the newer remote with the rubber buttons was not as good as the plastic buttons, but I have had no problems with it so far. The TV is faster than the stick and the voice search function is very convenient. Overall I am satisfied with the upgrade and even more so at the sale price."
1,I have a few of things and they all work great. Gonna get another one soon.
1,Purchased for our 3 year old grandson. He loves it.
1,"Given as gifts. Those who received are very pleased with size and function of tablet, especially the tablets with color cases. Have bought several and satisfied."
1,"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
1,The device is good for reading on. It feels like reading a book.
1,The product is easy for grandson to operate and navigate through and seems to be very durable
1,"The device is easy to navigate, easy to download books."
1,This Amazon Fire TV Box is perfect for Kodi and is really fast
0,"A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why."
1,"What I like most about this device is how smooth it operates. I used to have a Roku stick and experience lag times, and constantly had to restart this device.It has a ton of apps that I use. I would like to see them add ABC go, but I'm satisfied with the variety that is offered."
1,It's not only helpful but fun to have Alexa in the kitchen. You can play music or games while cooking dinner and get her to add things to the shopping list.
1,good starter tablet or great for games. fits in the purse or coat jacket.it was on sale for 50 dollars
1,"With this device, you no longer need anything but wifi."
0,Its a nice tablet for the money but I just didn't like being stuck in the amazon universe .
1,"Great sound. Was surprised how good it sounds. Wife loves it, especially the avaliable music apps."
1,"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
1,"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
1,"Great price. Bought thanksgiving day online. Could have picked up at store, huge supply. I got blue online, only black in store. Basic but worth the $33!"
1,"I bought this tablet for my daughters birthday, and she loves it. Reliable, and easy to use. May buy Another one for my wife."
1,"I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7"" for my wife that afternoon!"
1,i been using it for weeks and overtime i love it more and more!!! the voice control makes it really easy.
1,Bought it for the bedroom. Now I have to buy another for the family room.
1,"good product for youngsters, provides learning and fun together"
0,I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.
1,Very happy with this product. Way more than I expected and you couldn't beat the price.
1,"This product is great for reading, especially in the sun."
1,"This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to."
1,I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
1,"My daughters having fun with this tablet, great Christmas present."
1,"I haven't used it a lot yet, but the few times I did, it works great. It was easy to set up. Looking forward to be able to bring this with us on trips."
1,Present for daughter. It is a good tablet at a great price.
1,"I purchased this product for my kids over the holidays. I've been very impressed with the things you can do with it. Among other things, I enjoy using it for listening to music, checking the morning weather, or as a simple kitchen timer."
0,We bought this tablet for my 75 year old father who wanted something handheld to play games and read his email. It is good for that. Screen is too small for elderly eyes but it made him feel like he was getting with today's technology . It was very cheap on Black Friday!
1,"I bought this tablet for my youngest son. He was the last in our family to get a Kindle fire, we all have one. He loves it, as we all do. It's a quality tablet for a great price. I know from experience ( and daily use) that it will last a long time. Love it!"
0,Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
1,I replaced another Kindle Fire that was broken after I sat on it! I liked all the Fires that I have had so much that I bought another and it is still in use.
1,"This is a very good product, the nice thing about this is I can turn lights on and off, the product integrates with wemo, also they are always improving on the echo."
1,I have heard so many great things about the Fire so I bought it as a starter tablet for a relative.
0,"Software can be clunky to navigate. Certain apps are not available at this time for Amazon fire tv, only saving grace is my subscription to Playstation Vue"
1,Nice tablet. I use it often. Just the right size. Easy to use.
1,Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too.
1,Amazing tablet. Does almost all things my original 400$ kindle fire did. So very happy with my much cheaper option!!
1,No better tablet for the price. Amazon continues to produce excellent products.
1,I bought it for my mom and she loves it. Great picture and great battery life.
1,"This is good for traveling light but still possessing research powerful, especially in Wi-Fi areas."
1,I ordered two for my grandchildren for Christmas and decided to get one for me on the black Friday deal because I couldn't beat the price. I've been using it for about 1 week and so far I am really liking it and my grandkids will love it. They only issue I've had is the 3rd day I couldn't get it to charge so had to do a hard restart but now the charger cord that came with it no longer works but its too short anyway so I use a micro usb cord I had. I've read that this is an issue with these but who doesn't have an extra micro usb cord laying around.
1,The Kindle fire kids edition is a parent worry free solution to kids messing up potential settings love that you can set up a personal code and create multiple profiles
1,The tablet was easy to set up and the kids enjoy using it.
0,Cant answer as well as Amazon wish i had waited and bought Amazon
1,"Great tablet, my son loves it. Great resolution. I might get a second one for my daughter."
1,"This tablet is great for the everyday reader and gamer , I promise it will not dissapoint."
1,good Quality
1,"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
1,I enjoy it. It's gray for reading and working out.
1,This is a must have for the kindle. Great quality & texture.
1,"I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day. She loves reading but with the little ones in the house books were hard to keep. We are both very pleased with this as I can use it for a few books too. The picture and color on this thing is pretty darn good. I'm pleased with the sound as well. Overall this price is too good to pass up if you want a color screen reading tablet, this is a solid choice."
1,This is awesome! Welcome to the future. Love that it integrates with a ton of different things.
1,Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
0,"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall"
1,I really like the Kindle and appreciate the convenience. I use it all the time and especially like that it is backlit so I can read at night without turning on a light. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to tell which of the downloaded books I've already read. My old Kindle labeled them clearly but I can't find it on this new one. A small problem that is easily worked around.
1,Really like the Echo. Use it mainly for listening to music and shopping/to do lists.
1,"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
1,I bought this on Black Friday as a gift for my young son. It works as expected for the price that I paid sometimes freezes but for a young child it's perfect.
1,"The best ""personal home assistant"" out there. Also the first, so it has a head start on Google's offering."
1,"Not a lot of ink, but decent bang for the buck. Don't be fooled by the $100 ""original"" price, it is always cheaper."
1,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
1,Bought to listen to Pandora and MLB.tv. Awesome!
1,I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends
1,I bought two kindles for my children and they love them. They are easy to navigate for all of them .
1,"Alexa is the easy winner in every regard compared to Google Home. Echo can operate as a Bluetooth speaker, Home requires you stream their apps. Apple Music on Home, no sir. Audible on Home, also no."
1,The product is cheaper than the kid version but works the same. It is a great product from Amazon. The camera is so so but entertaining the kids are great.
1,The Amazon fire tv is plug and play. Very easy to use
1,Pleased with all the features. Amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inna small package.
1,This has the all speed and storage I needed for my preschooler. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
1,"I picked up 2 of these for my girls (ages 5 and7). They are constantly on them to play games and watch movies. At $50 each, these are great alternatives to an IPad. Also, there is no angst if they are lost or broken."
1,"I was using a Roku Ultra for awhile, but I found that I've been using the Fire T.V more and more. There's really nothing wrong with the Roku but I seem to like the Fire T.V more. Probably because you can side load Kodi on it ;)"
1,Alexa enable Amazon eco is awesome voice command device and great sound quality
1,It is a gift for my friend. She is really like it and said she is start to enjoy reading now.
1,I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable.
1,"Very easy set up, still learning all Alexa can do. Currently use her to play my shuffle station on Pandora. Very good speaker quality."
1,Best kindle ever!! Love that I can read at night without waking my husband. Buy one!
1,loved the size and lightness of the product. Stays charged for a long time.
1,This is a great product. Very easy to use. I would recommend this product to family and friends.
1,"I bought this to replace my ""old"" Kindle Paperwhite which I wore out. That poor old thing had been through the wars and kept on going. I can not complain about a device that lasted for several years. It was used daily, shoved into a purse without a case or cover, and had been sat on by people and cats,. The only thing I wish would be that the charging cable supplied had the wall plug to go with the USB cable."
1,I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price.
1,I really enjoyed the versitility of this item. it works wonderfully.
1,In my experience the Amazon firestick is by far the best streaming device currently available.
1,"Good tablet at affordable price, I would recommend for kids or only browsing"
1,My son and my daughter is very happy they play nice games
1,"Now I will admit I am a tech gal. I did do some investigations before buying. I was not dissapointed at all. This is like your own personal assistant. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, spell,set alarm,check weather,traffic,news update,even tells jokes. I love the fact that anyone can talk to it and it will still work. My family and friends have pure entertainment with this neat gadget. I look forward to seeing more things added to the commands. Also was super easy to set up and the volume is way better than expected."
1,"This isn't a high performance tablet but i didn't expect it to be for the price. It's perfect for playing app games, reading, and web browsing. The biggest downfall is the limitations on customizing the home screens."
1,I like it better than Ruko. You can also install your own kodi apps
1,Slow and has issues recognizing the sd card. I have enjoyed it however.
1,"Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books."
1,"I purchased this tablet as a Christmas present when they were having a sale. It's a good, basic tablet that does everything you could want a tablet to do (especially for the price I paid)."
1,"Very good product, very convenient. May buy another"
1,seems to just be a novelty. which has worn off....
1,Bought it as a gift for a family member and they use it everyday. Will probably buy one for myself.
1,"Amazon products amaze me for the value of what they are. This is no different. A great little 7 inch tablet where you can surf the web, watch movies, read books, or listen to music. Only really works if you have Amazon Prime. This really unlocks the potential. To really unlock the potential you can also subscribe to kindle reading unlimited if you read a lot or have several people in the family that will also read. I actually opted to return this one to upgrade to the Fire HD8 which was only about $20 more at the time and gives you a slightly bigger screen and HD resolution (I love to stream movies)."
1,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
1,This is a great tablet for kids or if you just want something to mess around on
1,we bought this amazon tablet because my 3 year received one as a gift for her aunt. My 2 year was using an iPad but kept dropping it. This is great because it's small enough for him to hold and if you buy the case it's completely protected. The only issue we seem to have is that the power cord is really loose when you plug it in to charge so sometimes it does not get charged. That is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars.
1,"The best device for a child in the market. Purchased for an infant and after two weeks, he is loving it. Easy to handle and durable."
1,"I like being able to just tell Echo to play music, or asking for the weather. Also works great with general questions. Only thing I'm not too happy with is it sometimes picks up what the TV is saying and attempts to do something with it. Looking forward to adding smart devices to the house and integrating Echo with all of that."
1,"This paperwhite has a sharp display (300 ppi) and adjustable brightness levels. It is extremely easy to hold when reading. Included in the box was the Paperwhite device, a USB cord, and quick start guide. No power adapter was supplied but I use the one for my cellphone and it works fine. One charge holds me for about 3-4 weeks.The ads are not as intrusive as I thought they would be however I am displeased with the quality of the ""special offers."" I have found better offers just by searching the web.Also you cannot listen to audible books on this device. It is reading only but that doesn't bother me.Overall this is an excellent device. Since purchasing this I have quadrupled the number of books that I read in a month's time. I highly recommend it to any avid reader."
1,Awesome battery life and readability in bright sunlight. Screen size and weight is just right to hold it in one hand.
1,I live these boxes. Since I installed one on every tv in my house everyone that comes over wants one. I have bought so many for family members as gifts.
1,I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
1,"Excited about this product, it is going to be fun to use and an interesting addition!"
1,Holds a charge with regular use for well over a week. Backlighting is wonderful. Easy to hold and use with one hand. Nothing is better! Take that iPad
1,Great little streamer and so much available content
1,Less buffering and better picture than previous Fire TV stick.
1,"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
1,This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
1,"This is ideal for the gift. For the price, the performance is satisfactory. Loads of apps and games. Definitely, this tablet is for everyone. Perfect for browsing, gaming, music, and learning.Battery comes okay. Build quality is satisfactory. For the price range, it is must to have."
1,Great product. It is very easy to use. Does what it's says it will do.
1,"Decided to get this tablet for my nephews 4th birthday present. Was a great choice. Easy for him to use and navigate, great speakers, and cool programs for kids. Very happy I got him this one out of the others I was looking in to. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants their computer, table, or cellphones back from the little ones. Lol :)"
1,Great price for this easy to use tablet for younger kids! Easy to get it going.
1,I would recommend this tablet for someone who loves Amazon
1,My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!
1,I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
1,HAVE BEEN USING THE BLACK AND WHITE KINDLE READER FOR SEVERAL YEARSAND THE UPGRADE TO THE FIRE HAS BEEN A MAJOR SURPRISE--IT HAS EVERYTHING I COULD WANT AND IN GORGEOUS COLOR. IT IS BASICALLY A COMPUTER AND IS MODERATELY EASY TO LEARN TO USE.
1,My grandson loves his. He uses it mainly for social media like Instagram and ovoo.
1,"My buddy got me this for Christmas. It is great to stream music. My wife got me a Prime account and we can now watch movies, listen to music, etc just by asking Alexa."
1,"Hi Alexa who is the best team in the NFL? Alexa's response, that is the Green Bay Packers!!"
1,Hours of battery life and easy to work. Great gift
1,"With this 3rd generation of the Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price. I previously owned a first generation Paperwhite, and the increase in resolution (300ppi, up from 212ppi) is really noticeable. After reading on this for a while, it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older Paperwhite. The white balance of the screen has also improved, with a slightly warmer, book-ish experience instead of the cooler, electronic-display-ish screen of the old on. Additionally, the screen can get crazy low in brightness! Ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off.. if you thought the previous Kindles got dark, this takes it to a whole new level of dimness."
1,I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
1,Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints
1,I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose.
1,"Perfect for young kids. Small, yet easy to operate."
1,The echo is a great gadget we use it all the time one of the best purchases we made from amazon
1,"I like it and it really does well, that said even though it is Android it is dedicated to only allow you to go through Amazon and not Google play."
1,I bought this for my dad. It is easy for him to use and he loves it because you dont have to be super tech wise to operate it.
1,"My grandson had taken over his mom's kindle she got 2 years ago, so we decided to get her a new one and she loves it."
0,"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """
1,"He loves it. He likes the camera and the apps, going to have to get one my granddaughter too."
1,We love Alexa and everything she can do for us and also the info for our son
1,"Best purchase ever, my eyes are getting bad with age and reading on my phone No longer works, great product for the price"
1,I love this this memory card. The price was good ty
1,"Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift."
1,"You cannot beat this price. I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my kids and the Fire 7 worked perfectly. They strictly use it for games, but the Fire 7 has allowed me to monitor what they are downloading and will filter out content that I select as inappropriate. Plus, all this is linked to my Amazon account. GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,I bought this for my husband mainly for surfing the internet. Seems to do this fairly quickly. He likes it.
1,This great for the money but it won't let you use Spotify??
1,I received this tablet as a gift. I love it so much that I bought one for my husband.
1,Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
1,This product works great for the that we bought it for.
1,This tablet is a good size for 4-8 years olds for their first one. After I bought and downloaded a few aps I realized that I should have gotten the tablet with more memory. Otherwise a good product. The table cover is a must to protect tablet
0,This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
1,4th Fire we have owned. My daughter uses it mostly
1,This thing is awesome!! Brings a lot of fun to the family!
1,I bought two of these for my grandchildren because they wanted one and the price was right. They used one before and are very familiar with it. They will love it.
1,really good charger
1,Worth for what you pay for.. Basic use is ok......
0,"This is a good tablet, but mainly for readers. There are a lot of apps for books, and such...but there are other apps you can download."
1,Love the apps of this device. Many hours of enjoyment for my son. Nice size for him to watch videos and learn as well.
1,"Great product, and very easy to install and use. I love the music from Amazon Prime!"
1,I have used this everynight since I bought it to catch all my favorite shows and movies. I am so glad I bought this product!!!!!!
1,"Sure. It's not an iPad, but it's only 50 bucks! Amazon is taking a loss on these in order to sell you their content. There are a few restrictions, like an advertisement on the lock screen and only access to Amazon's App store. These are small prices to pay for such a wonderfully performing tablet. Also, Amazon Underground gives you access to a ton of paid apps for FREE. If this is your first tablet purchase, it is definitely a winner. For those not new to the tablet world, it is definitely worth having just to carry around when you need it. You won't feel so bad if someone steals it or you lose/break it as opposed to an iPad. Just buy it already!"
1,Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!
1,nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
1,Amazon fire is the best one out the roku and Apple TV bedside it accept bird party apps ( if u know what I mean)
1,"I bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. So far, so good. She is able to navigate it easily and there are lots of free games. The battery lasts a decent amount of time. We just charge it at night when we go to bed. The only downfall is you can't watch YouTube on it. I'm not really sure why. I tried researching it and there's all these steps you can take to make it work but I'm afraid I'll mess something up so I haven't tried it. All in all, for $50 it's a great little tablet."
1,Great to have to keep the kids occupied in the car.
1,Not a bad tablet for the price. Iris skittle different from other tablet brands
1,The device works as advertised with very little set up.
1,"If it wasn't for my receiving an e-mail advertisement from Best Buy's weekly deals, I would not have seen Kindle Fire on sale. I have been most pleased and satisfied with the product and the free shipping offer from Best Buy."
1,"I have a bunch of sticks but to be honest, I like the box better. Runs much faster and less buffering"
1,The music and weather reports are terrific in addition to everything else.
1,"I love to read books....paper and electronic (via my iPad), but had never owned a Kindle. When shopping at Best Buy, I mentioned to my husband that I might want to try a Kindle....went to another area and, when I returned, the Kindle VOYAGE was in our basket. OK so I though I would give it a try. I LOVE it! So compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ??? I highly recommend the VOYAGE to existing and pending Kindle readers. So many great features in such a small package!"
1,Love the amount of time we can set that she can be on this! The bumper guard has been handy. Apps that were on it are awesome. Best of all she loves it!
1,"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
1,"I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers."
1,Great additional piece to go with Echo. If you want a additional unit you can't beat this product and the price!
1,I bought the fire TV to use with Playstation Vue It is more responsive for Vue than the app on PS4
1,I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast.
1,I wld buy this product again great pics and price is well worth it
1,"I bought this on impulse because I had heard great things about it. I have a variety of automated home devices, such as Philips Hue bulbs, and wanted to see if the Echo would help me control everything.I now use the Echo all the time for lights, alarms, and daily news. The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo! I have had no issues with it and it helps me everyday!"
1,So happy with this amazon fire tv it's at every tv in this house and those satellite bills in the trash!
1,"Cut the cord, get rid of cable, and buy one of these. Great device easy to use. No reason to spend hundred plus dollars a month on cable just buy one of these and pay 15 to 20 bucks a month And subscribe to a couple video services"
1,"He loves the games, that he can down loaded boos, music and videos."
1,"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits."
1,"Upgraded from a 7"" to 10"" Kindle Fire and it is so worth it. Great picture. Good storage. Love my Kindle."
1,We bought this for our 6 yr old kid. It is easy to use and the battery lasts for several hours.
1,No need for a smart TV. Just pick you up one of these and you are set. I purchased a 4K TV which had limited apps but was 600 less than the one which supported the additional app I wanted (PLEX) so I opted for the TV I got with this FireTV and I was set.
1,Love everything about it. Easy to use. Plug in. Download an app and good to go. Great sound quality on music
1,My son loves it and it has good battery life he plays it alot
1,"Great gadget for adults/kids with Internet questions and answers, alarm clock, timer, plays music, etc, and controlling home automation."
1,"If you are an Amazon Prime member this tablet works well. It is designed so you have easy access to Prime Books, Amazon Music."
1,"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away."
1,My niece was very excited with the use of this product. using it like table and comparing it to an ipad.
1,"This is my 4th tablet (all different brands) and it's the best yet! Easy to set up, loads and run fast. No problem getting books and apps. All for only $50!!! Also bought one for my husband and he loves his, too."
1,This is a great tablet for young and old alike. It has a track record of reliability and ease of use at a great price.
1,"The hardware is good, software isn't 100% operational all the time, i.e. PlayStation Vue has had issues quite often in the month I've had it, when it loads, it's great."
1,The whole family loves Alexa. Great speaker. Easy to setup and use.
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!
1,"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."
1,The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
1,"Long battery life, clear,crisp screen,lightweight and easy to hold. Compatible with Amazon's vast ecosystem of reading materials. Lose yourself in the book--- it is a joy to use."
1,Purchased as a gift for grandchildren after comments from friends and reviews about the parental controls. Would not have considered without this feature.
1,"Bought the Fire as a way to have a cheap and easy device for my kid to play on when I want/need the iPad, and as a secondary e-reader. I have Amazon Prime, so adding this device to my account/Amazon ecosystem was incredibly easy. I find the ease of purchasing Amazon items both slick and kind of creepy--but I knew that was part of the deal, buying an Amazon device. I can tune it out when I need to, and parental controls are easy to manage. The device is quick/responsive; color, brightness, and resolution are all quite good for a $50 device. It doesn't do everything but it does a heck of a lot for 50 bucks."
1,"It is amazing that a quality tablet is this reasonable. I got a special price, but, even at $50, it's a deal. The down sides, not enough to rate it low, would be the apps are not Play Store, though the OS is android based. You may not find certain apps you want, but, there are many in the Amazon store to choose from. Also, the screen savers are ads, but you can pay $15 and Amazon will take them off."
1,"Have used this device for about 30 days with absolutely no complaints. I was only considering a couple of different units because I mostly use it with Playstation Vue, but we also watch Netflix and Hulu! Alexa is a really nice feature. Completely satisfied!"
1,Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great.
1,"the product is really crafted for kids n they just glue to it as it offers an array of rich topics, apps, etc"
1,"Light, backlight makes it easy to read, easy to operate, reasonably priced"
0,"I have wanted my Amazon Echo for several years and was able to buy one BUT not without an extended warranty! Which if you buy ANY ANY thing from BEST BUY, it's Now imperative you spend your money for an extended warranty! Like now if it wasn't for the warranty on my Moto phone that I HAD to return it! Which is totally dysfunctional NOW and friends can't get it to work! My new exchanged phone has t totally screwed up my availability to access Pandora! Luckily, there's an extended warranty you have no choice BUT to purchase! They ""TRY"" to make everything right with customers!"
0,Most apps you have to pay for basic apps like YouTube will not download without inputting credit card information what tablet for child not plausible to put in credit card information
1,"It's a great gadget for children when going on trips, also traveling"
1,This tablet is the perfect portable size for me.It's connectivity with other devices is great and i can use it for a lot of fun disractions during my free time
1,"I've had an Echo for a couple years now, and it is pretty slick in some cases and grossly frustrating at others. Playing music, setting timers, asking specific questions and overall home control works well. Whenever you ask it what seems like a simple question in some cases, she cannot answer. Sometimes she hears wrong and plays music that is beyond interesting. One thing I can say is that Amazon has been working to make Echo better and better. I set 4 stars because I don't think it is quite a 5 star product yet."
1,"I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions."
1,This has worked flawlessly since I bought it a few months ago. Easy to use. Nice apps. Used primarily for Playstation Vue tv.
1,First time I've purchased this and found it excellent
1,good tablet for the price its quick and easy to use
1,The echo is an excellent product for listening to music and asking any question imaginable
1,nice tablet good value for your money kids love it
1,This is small and lightweight which makes it great for road trips.Easy to read.
1,Realy good tablet for a great price can't go wrong
0,"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product"
1,There are plenty of Youtube videos showing how to install Kodi on Fire devices.
1,I love my Amazon Echo. It's a terrific product with excellent voice recognition. The features available are continually improving and expanding. Highly recommended for anyone considering a smart home device.
1,"I enjoy my kindle tv, it beats paying for cable every month ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,I bought this tablet for Christmas as a gift. He enjoys the tablet & has been using it every day. It is well worth the money. Easy to use. Especially for a beginner.
1,"have not used it yet but excited to try it, looks like it would be fun!"
1,This was a gift to replace my first generation Kindle. It's smaller and lighter than the old Kindle (which is wonderful) although the screen appears to be the same size. I still much prefer the old-fashioned paper page but there's nothing better than a Kindle for the convenience of taking many reading choices on a trip.
1,"Bought it for my son to use for movies, games etc.... HE LOVES IT!"
0,Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
1,This is a vvery good device that serves its purpose extremely well and a at aprice thats afforadable and well worth it i would recomend it to friends and family
1,"We bought this as a gift for my 85 year old mother-in-law. She enjoys reading, but needed to magnify the text in order to read easily. The Kindle is simple enough for her to use and she is enjoying it."
1,"This is a great product with many options for movies, games, music and much much more"
1,Bought this for my 84 year old father-in-law. It was easy to setup to his WiFi and very easy to use. He loves it and now has a Facebook page.
1,"2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books."
1,"The Fire TV was very simple to setup and gives plenty of different viewing options. I currently subscribe to Netflix and Playstation Vue, both of which I can access on the Fire TV. I've also downloaded apps for ABC, HBO, Showtime, NBA TV, and others to expand my capability. Certainly worth the price even if you don't subscribe to Amazon TV."
0,"The tablet seems to work well. Not as fast as some but, not bad. I found it was not as easy to find an antivirus product to work with the Fire 7, as it was for other android products. I will use this tablet for reading books instead of surfing the web."
1,This has been a great addition to our home. We love using it to play music and getting general information.
1,Great price! Great product! For a beginner tablet it's useful and fast enough to keep your music and games going!
1,Me and my husband got this and the case for our niece and she loves it!
1,This is the 3rd tablet that we have purchased and at $50 you can't go wrong. Great for the kids to watch Netflix in the car. The only issue or flaw is the charging input always is the first to go.
1,We got these tablets for our 4 year old and 9 year old and they love it.
1,"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics"
0,"If you actually paid 20 for this adapter, you're out of your mind."
1,It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
1,Purchased to use as a kiosk for an app. Great value.
0,I wish alexa was a little smarter. Sometimes she doesn't understand what i am trying to ask.
1,I like this item because it has an eathernet port and is very fast .
1,"Good deal. Nothing special, but a lot for the money! Would buy again, we have multiple."
1,Time to disconnect from Cable TV and save $150 monthly. Can get almost every channel I need with out the cable TV expense. Takes some getting used to and planning but all in all a good choice.
1,Compared to the cheaper model this one streams a lot faster and smoother
0,"When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet."
1,"For $50 I couldn't ask for more! Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue. With the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget! This would have been the perfect gift for me, had I not already purchased it for myself!"
1,My daughter loves the games/videos that she can watch on it during the day and my wife uses it to read on during the evening. This thing gets used a lot! Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
1,This is the best purchase I've mad in a tablet my daughter loves it
1,I love it being able to just ask for a specific type of music and she usually can find it. The one thing I laugh about is if you speak certain words she thinks your talking to her lol
1,"The Best Buy salesman told us ""you can take it anywhere and it will play for hours"" true, if you buy a separate battery."
1,"Out of the box, was easy to setup and configure. Very user friendly and integrates in my home nicely"
1,Great product. No issues. I recommend it for all users
1,"Incredible value - at $49.99 this tablet is a wonder. Easy to use right out of the box. I'm not a techie, so ease of use is a must. Watch movies, read e-mail, download a book, listen to music and much more. Small size makes it easy to carry in your purse. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
1,"Device is great, easy setup (less than 10 minutes) and have had no issues. It's recommended to not be near walls, and will confirm, it works better away from walls."
1,"I bought two of these for my two grandchildren, ages 8 and 10. They love them. They are able to read books and play games on them. They were a great Christmas gift. So much so, that I bought a third one for my son-in-law and he is thrilled with it. The small price made it great for gift giving."
1,This product is amazing. It is so helpful and they update it with new skills all the time. I think it is one of my favorite tech products I have ever used.
1,"Happy The Fire TV, Have had no issues, Like another way to use Alexa."
1,Great little streaming box. Better than the fire stick.
1,"Perfect to have in the kitchen for news, music and recipes. Love it."
1,"I've found this to be an excellent tablet for children for the following reasons:Free Time Unlimited- You can create individual profiles for up to five children, and they can have access to a wide assortment of age appropriate apps, videos, and books. If you purchase the Kid's bundle a year of Free Time Unlimited is included with the tablet along with a shock absofbing case.Price Performance- You get a relatively powerful tablet for the $49.00 price tag. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime this tablet becomes a great travel companion. Prime allows you to download movies and TV episodes to your tablet for later viewing. This is a handy feature for me since I travel for work, and spend a good deal of time on planes. Cons: The only drawback I've found is the Web browser. It's not supported on in flight WiFi, but the ability to download from Prime for later viewing balances that out. I will experiment with side-loading Chrome and see if it works."
1,If you like movies it's worth it. Had to have a friend help us set it up but it works great
0,Pro's The colors on the screen are AWESOME. It is easy to operate and move around in and has lots of app's in stalled. Con's The operating speaker has very low output and is hard to hear.
1,"My kids are always arguing about who gets to play on my iPad. This should eliminate the arguments, it's a good tablet that is expandable and for $50 you can't go wrong."
1,The Fire Stick and TV is awesome. Fire TV is a lot faster and it has the option of ether net. I love it.
1,Compare to the my old Kindle this so much easier to read no matter where the place or the lighting.
1,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
1,I love my new Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - Black. I would highly recommend it.
1,Definitely better than my prior kindle. I do not need reading light anymore
1,Tablet is modest for it's price. Good for beginners.
1,"I got 4 for our boys 15 , 13, 10 & 5 Love that I can create profiles for them an manage their content"
1,Didn't give 5 stars due to she is still learning! (so am I)New skills are being added weekly!
1,"This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read."
1,awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use
1,I enjoy this product. I wish it did more. It was a Christmas gift for my spouse and they enjoy it.
1,"I am enjoying my Amazon seven inch tablet. It is fast paced with good graphics and long battery life. The main problem is that the volume is lower than other tablets. Still,great deal for the price."
1,"Amazon killed the tablet market by introducing this!! $50 for a high quality tablet. Needless to say, everyone got one for Christmas. Easy to use and great quality just a wierd packaging"
1,"I would recommend this product. It is very user friendly, It is useful for the entire family. I am not familiar with other products like the google home but I would like to bet this is way better."
1,Very fast. Does everything you need it to at a great price.
1,This is the only way to read a book now! I love it.
1,"Amazing! Easy to install and set-up. Voice control works well and controller fits easily in hand with the buttons in the right place. Got the first one for my wife at Christmas, we now own 4. Had 2 of the original Apple TV with small limited controller. That was painful. Amazon TV Is well worth the money!"
0,Stopped working after only a year. Felt flimsy. Did like that I could upload Amazon books
1,"We both really enjoy our Echo. There was no problem setting it up. I literally just plugged it in and haven't touched it since. Besides enjoying the music we really like the ""Shopping List."". The weather function is great also. As far as it's sound, it has a little too much bass for me. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars"
0,"Bought this to lay on the coffee table for quick email checks and google searches. If you are looking for something to watch movies on or simple tasks, then it will do ok. Not a daily driver for sure."
1,4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
1,My family really enjoys the Amazon Echo. We have it set up to automate our home and remind us of things that are in our schedules. We picked up the Echo and two of the Echo Dots. We love to play our music and control our television by just simply telling it to do so. Locate your phone with one of the skills. I purchased one for my mother so she can use My Buddy if she gets hurt and call for someone if she can't get to her phone. There is a lot of potential for development in home automation as well as the connected automobile.
1,Great sounding speaker!! I purchased it as a gift.
1,"The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!"
1,This is a great easy to use tablet! Very affordable!
1,I am enjoying control over what I watch and not watching same thing over and over like with cable.
1,"I got this to replace my original Kindle just to read ebooks, thinking the back light would be a nice feature. I really didn't think I would use the other features but I have found that I really like being able to check my email & surf the web without lugging my laptop around. My wife has a more expensive tablet but my Fire does everything hers does. I love it!!"
1,Took it to the beach and read by the pool and was very easy to read
1,Have fun with it .Good game Good apps . Easy to used
1,"Bought this as a present for our son, turns out to be a great present for the family. Very easy to use and as advertised."
0,The sound quality of the speaker in my opinion is not worth the extra cost versus a Echo Dot. I could spend the difference on a separate speaker to use with the Dot and also have the flexibility of using that speaker elsewhere.
0,"The price may be attractive, but not worth to buy. After seeing tabs like iPad, Nexus and others, you wouldn't be willing to use it as the display is just 1024 x 600 pixels, touch is not very smooth, not so good customized apps/games (though there is a way to install all Android apps). The build quality is good though."
1,"I have to remember Alexa is not Google, but she does know a lot and can tell you a joke if you ask her. I use her for timers (working out), alarm clock, and to tell me the weather on a daily bases. The 360 degree speaker sound is a plus as well when I'm streaming Pandora!"
1,This is the best Kindle I have ever used. This is way better than the Kindle Fire HD which I also own.
1,having a lot of fun teaching alexa and also learning a lot of new facts
1,"Initially bought the Amazon Echo Dot liked it. It was fun and entertaining. Sound was not bad for a small unit. But upgraded to Echo Touch, sound was much better quality. Then upped it again to Echo. We gave our Dot to our daughter. But kept the Echo Touch to pair it the Echo, so we can hear same music in multiple rooms, or Living Room and one outside patio, etc., Works great that way. We also have the Bose 20 Wifi and Sound link Mini. Can't beat Bose Sound, but they need to address some technical issue, i.e. cannot pair those two together? Yuh, really !"
1,This product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations. While it is an option I prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command. That way its not listening till I tell it to unlike Google's device and the other amazon devices.
1,"I know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an Apple TV rather than a review on the moerits of this device, but I have owned both and stuck with the Apple TV instead of this.The Apps I used (DirecTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) choked and buffered much more often, or froze completely. The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's."
1,Good tablet for Facebook and games. Clean quick and she says it ok..ehhh
1,The Kindle Fire is a wonderful addition to my laptop. There are times I just don't feel like using the big laptop. And the Kindle is nice to have next to my bed for when I am awake at all hours. Love the ease of use and all the things it can do.....and I don't know the half of it! Great item.
0,This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.
1,"Love this tablet! Highly recommended, especially for a toddler who's learning. Has lots of games and activities for learning, parental controls, which I find extremely necessary for the internet today!"
1,"If you're deciding between the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, then fork up the extra costs and get the Echo. Its hands down better. Its been around longer so it has more experience and technology compatability. You will not be disappointed."
1,"Such a neat addition to our home. Alexa keeps up with my shopping list and reminders. Plus, my son loves her games and stories!"
1,Easy to setup and navigate- several TV/Movies available in UHD
0,The tablet works only when it wants too. I have to restart it all the time for it to work properly. Only have 2 weeks with it and the youtube app sucks it doesn't work properly
1,My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes.
1,Christmas gift that I use way more than I thought I would. Feel like hearing a song or an album or a genre when I get home. Sounds great too.
1,MY DAUGHTER HAS ABSOLUTELY NOT PUT THIS TABLET DOWN SINCE I BOUGHT IT...
1,So convenient and hands-free control of functions I'd normally do on my iPhone
1,Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it's expandable of 128 GB
1,It's a great item to have in the house or wherever you maybe.
1,Great tablet for the price. Easy to read documents.
1,"I started with Netflix and have since added Fire TV. Its good to have options and you get it by adding Fire TV. We use Fire TV more than Netflix currently, so I guess that is the best endorsement I can make"
1,Great tablet for the price well built and worth every penny
1,"This was a christmas gift for my nephew, he really enjoy playing games a watching videos, its a cheap and good alternative to the i-Pad :-)"
1,I do like the Amazon fire TV. There are a few things I do not like. Mainly the layout of the menus amd getting around. To many duplicates displayed and to many pay for shows mixed in. Even with prime there are things you have to pay for. There is an option to see only prime but you have to set it each time and that blows. They really need to work on thier menus.
1,Device size and speed are more than adequate for an 8 year old. I love Freetime and the ability to set limits for weekdays and weekends so my grandson is able to play without my direct supervision. Apps and books are age appropriate. I may have to buy 2 more for the 4 year olds.
1,Good for your kids at 50.00 bucks wont hurt that much when your kids accidentally break it or damage it.
1,Fire TV delivers. Good device with a very easy to use interface. Easy to set up.
1,"amazon fire tv, i use it a lot, it is worth the price it cost.."
1,"If your looking for a tablet to surf internet, facebook, emails, etc. than this is it. I can watch crystal clear movies through app Netflix/Infinity- live TV and shows. No tablet out there to beat this $39.99 product. So far so good!"
1,Bought this charger for the Kindle voyage and its great.
1,"I purchased this Echo for my uncle, who is a IT Network Architect and loves everything tech. He has a smart home so he's basically able to carry out everyday tasks with ease (lights on/off, thermostat, grocery list, security system, etc.) He loves that he's able to play his music just by taking to Alexa. I'm so glad I got this for him, he loves it!!"
1,It is so easy to read on the Kindle. It works inside or outside. How did I ever make it without my Kindle?
1,We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!
1,love the fire tv . best buy shipping is great very fast ship.
1,"The firetv has a compact, sleek design, is easy to set up and also has the ability to configure using cat5 cable, which for my area is much faster than WIFI."
0,"The processor is very slow. The tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from Amazon, but it is really slow opening aps. Pay more to get the better processor."
1,My Google Nexus suddenly died with 5 blinks of death so I got this for temporary tablet. Nice to have micro SD slot. Can't find some of my needed apps yet like my BANK. Maybe it's me.It has Single speaker but if I want nice sound I'll use headphones.Maybe a touch dimmer than the Nexus.It fits my old Bluetooth keyboard so I'm good.
1,"I got this on black Friday for $35. For the price I wasn't expecting much. Let me tell you it exceeded my expectations. I was only wanting this to play music, but I have been checking my email, browsing the web, using Bluetooth for music. Its amazing. It can go the whole day on one charge. You will defiantly want a SD card for it! It rarely lags and is pretty fast too. Only thing I don't like is the ads on lock screen (you can pay 15 more to remove them)"
1,I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!
1,This tablet holds everything that I want and still has room to get through the net fast.
1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband, he loves it, user friendly and fun to have, so glad I went ahead and bought it. I am thinking of getting the echo dot for myself"
1,"This is my second kindle fire I have purchased for myself and a family member. Great tablet, easy to use, light weight and a great price."
1,I purchased this for my self and it was just so easy to use. I never had one and now I can't seem to put it down.
1,Bought for my son for Christmas and so far he loves it good value for the price.
1,"Love using this for the house, it works all of my products in the house"
1,I purchased this tablet as a gift for a graduate based on the recommendation of a Best Buy Associate. The graduate has provided great reviews and continues to use it. It was easy for her to set up and she able to access apps and programs that meets her needs. I woul recommend this tablet based upon my experience.
1,love this. I didn't want anything super big or bulky. something simple for a few fun app games
1,"Good to have for smaller tablet use. Lightweight, easy to carry."
1,"Absolutely love the Echo, I purchased 3 Dots also."
1,Very portable. Easy to use. Well worth the price..
1,We are enjoying Alexa. We are learning more about what she does everyday.
1,"It's so cool it's scary. Kids love it, I love it. Awesome"
1,My wife love to listen the music on It warm great sound
1,The quality of the speaker is better than I expected and my kids really enjoy playing games with Alexa. The only criticism that I have is that it doesnt do well with voice commands from a distance.
1,My tablet is great and my kids love it's there Christmas gift. Now they can leave my iPad alone for now on.
1,I recommend it for kids .great for find games easily.
1,I used this player for Netfis andl streaming movies.
1,this was a Great product. i would recommend this..
1,My mom loves it. She doesn't even use her chromebook anymore. I love my new chromebook shhhhhh.
1,I'm very happy with this tablet..My nephew loves it.
1,"I cant think of enough things to ask Alexa to do for me.We are constantly listening to music from my youth (1960's).She (it) actually tells me jokes, it is like having another person in the house with you.She (it) also provides me with the current and future weather both in my area or anywhere else I might be interested in."
1,"Bought this because my old Galaxy Tab 10 has become old and slow. Very pleased with the Fire tablet, quickly loaded books, magazine subscriptions and easily taps into my Amazon Prime subscription - video and music. Only reason it gets 4 stars versus 5 is the annoying ad on the lock screen (although I'm sure that's why the device is so cheap)."
1,The device was easy to operate and met all my expectations.
1,You can read in the sun! It holds more books than I can carry. And you can read your own PDF files
1,Very fast box that I ever own very reliable product
1,"Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!"
1,I bought it for granddaughter so she would leave my tab alone and it worked my tab is mine again
1,I wasn't sure how amazon echo will work and got it initially to control my Philip Hue lights. I was amazed by list of smart devices it can support. It also connects to the apps like pandora iheartradio and likes. I am in love with Alexa. The speaker is powerful and the sound is crisp. I didn't know that amazon dot could perform exact same tasks and it's almost 1/3 the price. Though I don't regret buying echo but I could have bought dot which is $50 a piece compare to $179.99 for echo. Could have got 3 dots for different locations
1,It was great my son uses it everyday. Has a great camera and it has really good service with that. Love love love it
1,I'm still adjusting to all its benefits. easy setup.
1,I bought this for my 10-year-old's birthday. It was the perfect price range. It's actually very well suited to a young preteen. He can game and read books without issues.
1,"I have tried the google home smart device and I have been much happier with the Amazon echo. It has a good microphone - I can speak commands from across the room. It almost always responds correctly to my questions / commands. The smart features work well and I am VERY happy that I can stream whatever I want to it as a bluetooth device. It's an overall better product than Google Home but the speaker volume is not high quality at the louder levels. I don't really need to crank it up that often so it's adequate for me, but that might be a more important feature for others. Overall - I am very pleased with this product."
1,Love my fire tv..... Mad I waited so long to get it but the best thing that has happened to me so far this year!! lol
1,"I love the paperwhite. I can read it in any light without glasses. I always have a variety of books, to suite my reading taste. I got a rocketfish wall charger for a great price at bestbuy and it's so much easier to charge my kindle. I've been reading for almost 10 hours on the same charge. If you love books you have to get one of these! My house would be full of books, but now I can get books I would not otherwise purchase because of physical space limitations. I have over 100 books on my kindle and it takes up less space than 1 book. Many sites offer free or reduced price books. This expands my reading appetite to other areas I would probably not have even considered before. I love my kindle, my only regret is not getting one sooner!!!"
1,We love our Alexa. We can get so much info from this thing & we listen to music all the time. This thing has an awesome speaker for the size.
0,Good unit. But i have to reconnect the wifi often when using netflix
1,The Echo is a fun new tool to easily interface with the information highway. But there is a learning curve to navigate in order to be able to get the most out of the Echo. Sometimes Echo does not understand your requests. So you have to be able to restate certain requests.
1,"I was giving the tablet as a gift for Christmas to a 3 year old. I initially purchased the ""standard version"" but returned it for the kid version which included a ""Bumper box"" as well as a 2 year warranty, which the standard version did not have. Thankfully, I asked the parent of the child if it was OK for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child. The set up took some time. I was thankful that I read the reviews because I bought an additional memory card since the product only has 8GB of storage. The child was able to open the gift and ""play"" immediately as a result of doing up-front work. One thing I noted that when the child played a movie through Netflix, the resolution was not very good. Could be an adjustment needed in the tablet, which has yet to be worked out. I would recommend this, but if giving as a gift for a child, I would recommend doing the up-front work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it."
1,"i had purchase the Amason fire table for the grandkids and it works great, the kids are having alot of fun downloading games and playing them with the family."
1,i have the firestick in our bedroom and this in the living room. works great very fast. for the price its well worth it.
1,"it worked fine, was a lot of fun, but had to return it - no complaints about product or best buy."
1,She does what I ask of her for now. I haven't really gotten a chance to open up all her abilities due to the fact I don't have other smart things. She plays my music tell me my weather and what is on my to do list.
1,Got it for my 2 daughters for Christmas and they very happy
1,Great tablet for my 10 year old daughter she loves it.
1,This was a Christmas gift for a family member. He absolutely loved it!
1,"excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again"
1,My kids love that they can ask her any question and she answers it.
1,"Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service....."
1,Great for reading outdoors and in low light. Easy to use than my old one and lighter.
1,"Only downfall is there are lots of pop up ads, otherwise a great inexpensive tablet!"
1,Amazon Alexa is user friendly and easy to hook up.
1,"I saw this come up on the deal of the day and didn't know it's capabilities.Connected in less than 1 minute to my wireless network and it was up and running. The microphones pick up my voice from across the room and I can even connect the blue tooth speaker to my apple products iPhone and iPad! Has huge music playback from all the services, Pandorra , iHeart, Amazon Prime and others. I haven't even used 10% of its capabilities. I also control my remote Ecobee3 thermostats. Waiting for the next deal of the day so I can get a few more of these for upcoming Holiday and Birthday gifts!"
1,Really impressed with it. So many more features and works more like a cell phone than a tablet.
1,"I use my Kindle fire HD 10 in 3 ways 1 for reading Kindle books, 2 for streaming TV shows or movies while riding my exercise bike, 3 to surf the internet."
1,Bought it for 12 year old. Works great and he loves it. Very happy.
1,Purchased as a gift and my family really enjoyed it.
1,I just retired and Alexa will be a great companion now that I'll be at his me.
1,Once you get the Amazon box you don't need to pay for cable again!
1,This was the perfect product for my family as it provides tons of streaming resources!
1,"Just say Alexa and what you want her to do and she does it. Yes sometimes if there is some noise or if you don't speak clearly she might get it wrong but most of the time she gets it right. My only flaw with Alexa is the music, which isn't a problem with the product it's self but when it comes to playing music other than Pandora- you do have to subscribe to unlimited music which is reasonably priced and is worth it but do wish it came with it. Other than that I love asking Alexa to play a certain song and she plays it. She is amazing I would recommend it to anyone. Also look into her cool features their so helpful, definitely her to do list and grocery list."
1,Excellent for reading and can be used as a tablet for Internet use.
1,"My niece loves this tablet & I love the Amazon add on that lets me control what she can do, how long she has per day, and when it turns off for the night/ turns on in the morning."
1,Alexa works fine but has trouble wit questions that requires search on the web. I have mine connected to a Smartthings Hub and for the most part they work well together. Alexa has trouble running some of the automations.
1,"I have the Amazon stick but this is much faster and better. I am very happy I purchase the Amazon TV box. I bought this TV box for my bedroom which I spend 90% of my time. It is much faster than my regular Netflix site. I love the idea I can also log on to my Netflix on the TV box, too. I am going to get another one for my family room. Good thing it was on the Labor Day sale (Smile)"
0,Rather would have the fire stick as it is smaller and cheaper. I feel as though it has the same features.
1,Seemed pretty simple to set up. Thinking about getting one for myself.
1,"I got it for a friend, and she loves it for the amount of info she gets from it."
1,"The Kindle10 is OK, but a bit confusing to figure out. I do love the larger screen since I need to increase the text size. However, I did find a book that does explain the Kindle10 version on Amazon."
1,"Very easy to use,Great selection of titles to download. Screen is very easy to read"
1,"The Fire TV box definitely connects faster when using for streaming well worth the money at Best Buy.com definitely recommend it. No buffering, Stable!"
1,Alexa has become part of the family and her ability to interact is awesome!
1,"I use the Fire Table to read before bedtime. Its nice and light so my arms don't get tired, and I can adjust the light setting so it doesn't bother my wife. It also travels really well... Well worth the $49 I paid for it."
1,"Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device"
1,"I love this so much, I bought two! Also bought one for my parents. It is really easy to start up. Walks you right through the install process. I highly recommend."
1,Wonderful
1,Gives me access to all the streaming apps I use and easy to move from room to room
1,I would recommend this product to anyone that is interested at this time.
1,This is great ebook reader Simple interface and easy to understand. Web browser is not that great but it serves great purpose for what it is made
0,very similar items as the stick. able to use a sd card in addition
1,I had this set up in minutes. Very easy. The sound is great. Wonderful variety of features. Love it!!!
1,I love this box with its bigger memory capabilities. Looks great on my 4k tv
1,I bought this tablet for my children. It is great and comes with parental controls. I would highly recommend this tablet.
1,I paid $29 for the Kindle ($49 - $20 in reward cash were applied) At $49 the Kindle Fire is a steal. The 7inch display makes the 1024x600 resolution appear crispy like any HD. The educational game I purchased is fun and noticeably working. The parental controls are solid and his profile includes a safety browser with pre bookmarks added to Disney TV shows and his favorite Thomas & Friends. You can add in the kids Netflix setup and share content easily between our profiles.
1,"The battery lasts very long. This saves me so much space at home!! I take it with me everywhere gym, work, long trips!! Very happy with my purchase..."
1,My kids love this. They can come down stairs and tell it to play music while they eat breakfast and wake up
1,"Works great. Easy to set up. Use with app on Iphone, Bought plug for lamp and use it to turn off and on even when not home.Speakers are excellent. Picks up voice even from far away. I recommend this product."
1,"I love this, it is absolutely perfect for all my online needs"
1,"Amazon Echo is a great personal assistant. I find it more helpful than Siri on my iPhone. It can be used to set timers, work outs, and silly things like telling jokes plus much more. Also, it can be used to turn your home into a smart home which I have done with my lights. ""Alexa, turn on lights."""
1,"I love my Echo Tap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forcast and local events. Great purchase."
1,"Love it, even my grandbabies love the echo they always asking her questions"
0,"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet."
1,bought this for my wife she loves the fact she can now expand the memory to 128 gig
1,It is perfect for anyone and especially for a child moving on from a Kurio. It is easily regulated by a parent with the parental controls.
1,The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it!
1,I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
1,My daughter loves this! Expandable storage helps when we make our twice yearly drive to Texas and all the games and apps are definitely age appropriate so I don't have to worry about get getting onto anything she isn't supposed to be on!
1,"I've not yet learned - or taught - Alexa but it does perform a few functions that saves time or adds interest to my life. If there is a link to the skills or learning, I missed it. I think it could totally rock if that were available. I'm quite sure I'm not using it to its full capacity."
1,"We haven't opened ours up yet, but a friend of mine has one and that's the reason we bought it. It's so much fun and easy to use."
1,"My wife and I have been cordcutting for a while with a Roku TV on one TV and a PS4, I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV...WOW this device is beyond awesome. I live the alexa integration to find movies. the only way it would be better is if Alexa could tune to channels on PlayStation Vue. The ability to clone my Android phone to this device is great as well. I would very highly recommend this device"
1,"I have a few smart gadgets (switches, cameras, firetv, locks, etc.) and it is super convenient to control them from your couch. My 2 year toddler loves playing his favorite rhymes (or he tries to :) ) . I love Alexa."
1,My kids love their new Kindle Fires! No issues and we bought these in August. Highly recommend.
1,"It's great. We have a an echo dot as well and the big one sounds so much better. If you need it for music, don't go with the dot. Go with the Echo (big boy)!"
1,you just ask instead of having to get on your phone or tablet. fun and informative. simple to set up and use
1,Love the tablet. For this price it's an amazing offer
1,"Right size to carry anywhere, very good display to read, great camera, great to take on long trips with books and movies"
1,"Alexa can make your life easier and answer all those questions you are wondering about when sitting around with your friends and family;Great to play music also and answer sports, Weather and trending topic questions"
1,"Very convenient! It fits in my purse or jacket pocket, which is a plus, and it has most of the same apps that are available for my mobile phone. I am enjoying my new device."
1,This was a gift bought because I have had one for years and am completely happy with everything about it.
1,We purchased on of these tablets for the family during a black friday sale. my 8 year old son loves to play games on it and watch videos at home and on long car rides. My wife loves it to read books. We ended up buying a 2nd one because the use of the first was so much. we love it and cant beat the price
1,"This tablet is technically my 3rd tablet. I always look for something cheap, and useful. I also am always looking for tablets that I know I can easily replace without cringing, if my son destroys them. This tablet has been the best so far. I love the limitation I can place for my son's usage, and the fact I can specify on what they can spend time on! Battery time is really good, I usually have to charge it every other day, even after heavy usage it does take a while before it needs to be charged. Wish there was more apps, and I have had issue with certain apps, but it may just be those developers issues and not the tablet itself."
1,"I have to start by saying the last thing I wanted or needed was another device in my system. Being an Apple household I would prefer that my AppleTV handle the functions that I purchased the FireTV for, namely Amazon Prime Video. But apparently the feud between Apple and Amazon won't end in favor of their customers, and Amazon won't be building a Prime Video App for ATV.So I picked up a Fire TV and have to say I'm impressed, especially for the price. Many Apps (including Prime Video and Music), Netflix, voice control, even 4K (though I haven't tried that). No AirPlay of course, so I can't get rid of my ATV, and it doesn't integrate with my Macs the way ATV does. Bottom line, I got it for Prime and it does a great job, for a non Apple house it would be all you need."
1,I love the Echo's ease of checking the weather and traffic in the morning by simply speaking a question! Not having to browse channels on the tv or sites on the Internet saves me time and gets me out the door much quicker each day.
1,Great accessory to a house. I love how you can say just about anything to it and it has an answer or solution.
1,Love it and have never had any issues with the fire tv box.
1,I love the Fire TV and have had no issues. It is very easy to use and setup.
1,Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again.
1,Easy to use. Has a nice clear picture.comes with some good apps.
1,Has been very good Have watch more movies than I ever have in my life. Has so much stuff on it I haven't seen all of it but find something new on it everyday has so much to explore!!!!!!
1,"I'm was so pleased with this tablet, I bought a second one for my father. We both love it."
1,It's easy to use and downloading apps for learning and educational resources are very easy. I will recommend this tablet to everyone for their child.
1,Works Great. Thanks
1,"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
0,Bluetooth inaccessible if not connected to Wi-Fi. Device not chargeable hence not portable.
1,"This little device is impressive. Easy to install and simple to navigate. I own both the Fire TV and the Fire Stick. The Fire TV is slightly quicker at responding to input, but not so much that it's a deal breaker. The Stick is great for taking with you on the road. Both devices are a great value. No complaints whatsoever."
0,It works as advertised. I bought it as a gift so don't use it everyday.
1,This device has been an amazing addition to my entertainment system
1,I love my Amazon Fire Tablet so much that I purchased one for all my kids and my 78 year old mother as well. She has never used a tablet and it was easy enough for her to figure out and she uses it everyday!
1,Using it for reading ebooks on commute and watching youtube. What more can you ask for this price.
1,Alexa is like talking to ur self but with google knowledge and answers back
1,"I had reviewed and looked at this Samsung 65"" 4k HDTV and at this timeit was the best for the money..Very satisfied with TV and would recommend it to anyone."
1,The Picture awesome. Memory card can be installed.
1,Easy to setup and use. The content is very clear. Connect to wireless or Ethernet and off to the races.
1,"Alexa turns out to be a great source of local information as you're waking up getting breakfast ready, has a great library of songs just for the asking. The gift that you'd pick for yourself."
1,My family loves the firetv. The only thing we had to do was upgrade our Internet speed.
1,We use the Amazon echo for everything from News updates to the weather report to playing our favorite music to controling lights in our home no complaints love it
1,there were so many movies to pick from and also so many tv shows to watch all in great quality.
1,This is a great little starter tablet for my son and his cousins!
1,How can't you like a cheep tablet that almost does everything a iPad does? I bought this as a book reader but it is so much more.
1,Great screen and load speed is quick. Can watch movies and search on internet with out any problem-
1,Amazon echo is excellent all it does is make you lazy haha! Get it!
1,"This is my third Kindle, plus I have used the Kindle app on my two iPads and three iPhones. I always want to have a real Kindle so I will read in peace and avoid distraction from email, texts and such.This is much more readable that all of the previous models. The resolution is as good as I could ever want. The lighting is perfectly even and makes reading in any light (or lack of) completely comfortable. The screen response is almost perfect, but I am just getting use to the new side areas to turn pages. I love the weight and can read in any position, including on my back in bed, with one hand.I am perfectly fine with paying $200 for this Kindle. If you want something to read your books, and nothing else, this is the product for you."
1,This product is easy to use for beginners and has all the features and applications available for download like other expensive tablets.
1,I received the Standard Kindle as a gift and upgraded to the paper white. It is perfect for all settings and is super easy to use. The backlights and adjustable dimmer makes it perfect in any light. I am reading so much more now with my new Kindle Paperwhite. Absolutely love it!
1,"We bought these tablets for our children ages 5 through 10 for gameplay so they could stay off of my Samsung tablet. Hallelujah! They absolutely love them! The only problem that I have with tablet is the length of the cord on the charger. It's too short. If you want to continue play while it's charging, you have to literally sit right next to the electrical source. We remedied this problem by exchanging the cord for a longer one that we had around the house."
1,I love my Amazon Echo; there are so many apps and things you can do to make life easier. Highly recommend checking out the Echo!
1,I bought this for my son. He absolutely loves it. His purchase was mainly based on his friends having this model and being very pleased with it. He is very pleased with it.
1,"Good tablet and reader. It does not have a great battery life, but it is charged quickly."
1,Got this for my dad as a gift. He loved it! Great alternative to an iPad
1,I really love my kindle fire. It's my second one. It's convenient and has so many functions.
1,"What a great tablet. I purchased this Amazon fire tablet for my niece for Christmas I love the colors that are available, the price was excellent. Very happy with my purchase definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a low price tablet."
1,I really like the Anazon Echo. I'm still waiting for them to team up with Sonos so I can play my music using Alexa.
1,"Fire TV out of the box is great but by adding protocols and search engines available on-line, you can turn your Fire TV into a dynamic and constantly evolving device that can find and play virtually any television show or movie that is available from anywhere in the world. It's especially good as a base platform for steaming services like Netflix, You Tube, etc."
1,"I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!"
1,"We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
0,"This Kindle is great for the price. However, there are some downsides to paying for a $50 tablet. The battery life goes very quickly, so daily charges are necessary if you're a heavy reader. You also can't save anything of merit like books or magazines to a mini-SD card, thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money."
1,"cool stuff for home automation & very useful for other services like News, Alarm, Music, Weather and etc."
0,"I ordered two of these tablets, one for 4 yr old, and another for mom. It is not user friendly, difficult to use and full of advertisements even when not online. Comes with games that kids enjoy, but very limited on other application options. Book ordering requires monthly subscriptions. We have purchased another product for mom, and the 4 yr old quickly got bored with the limited options, and I got frustrated trying to navigate."
1,"Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit."
1,This is a very nice tablet for a first time tablet owner. Reasonable price and able to expand memory with micro sd card
1,"If you are thinking about cutting the cord to cable TV or getting rid of satellite TV, this is the way to go. As long as you have an Intenet connection, this device can give you anything you can think of to watch. Great product!"
1,LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU ASK FOR A SONG AND IT PLAYS IT ALMOST INSTANTLY
1,The firestick is great and sasy to use.I tell all my friends how great it is . I have purchase one gor my travels
1,"what an amazing find! I was looking for a gift for my relative, somthing thoughtful, yet not too expensive. And here it was: Perfect size, and light, access to the internet, working great for a friendly price. Just today I received another text from my relative how happy she was with it!"
1,Our first one was defective but was replaced by Amazon. Our replacement works great.
0,"Works good, but a little cluttered display, I prefer the Roku"
1,"Great for grandkids, my six year old grandson loves it."
1,"The main reason I purchased this was because I like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. It's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old Kindle I have, so that was a huge bonus. The one draw back/gripe I have is the ""back"" triangle button. The scriptures I read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old Kindle, I could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page I was on. E.g., if I was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. With this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tap/swipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if I'm on page 10, and I take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. The work-around that I discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time-intensive than the old Kindle back button. The only other concern I have is the battery life. If I'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation (e.g., reading fantasy), I'll probably use my old Kindle. If I want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries (e.g., scripture study), the new Kindle is the better bet. The commentaries I reference are PDFs - I could create a Kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the PDFs, and I don't care for the PDF viewer that came with the Kindle because you cannot bookmark the PDF or annotate it. I purchased a very inexpensive PDF app called ""exPDF Reader"" which does everything I want with PDFs. All-in-all, the Kindle - Fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so I take it everywhere. I read that others were concerned about it's weight, but I find it to be light. I'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. A pleasant surprise I had was the ""blue shade"" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle/quality of sleep. You don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old Kindle, so that's a nice perk too."
1,This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.
1,Bought for my 9 year old and it is perfect. She uses it to play learning games and even to read kid books on it. Was affordable and get's plenty of use.
1,I rarely watch live TV so watching my favorite TV programs on the fire TV works better for me. Also great for watching netflix.
1,Amazon ' s iPad basically and better in my opinion.
1,"I'm enjoying Alexa. She plays music, tells jokes, recites facts, and probably a million other things I haven't thought of yet. I'm glad she's at my house."
1,Awesome tablet kids loved it they can't drop it they use it for games videos and homework
1,This device was easy to use. It was as it was described.
1,Great funtionality and the remote with voice control is great. Better expierence than chromecast. The remote and streaming quality is superior than the chromescast solution.
1,"Friends at work had been telling me about the fire box and fire stick for quite some time. Finally decided to get one and glad I did. With Netflix, Amazon Video and specific channels, I think I'm going to cancel my cable subscription. Definitely recommend."
1,The only problem I have is using the name Echo instead of Alexia. Came very quickly.
1,at 49.00 it was the best price for a small touch panel
1,I bought this for my 9 year old grandson. He asked for a tablet for Christmas.
1,I purchase this kindle for father's day and my uncle loves it
0,Alexa doesn't know half of what my computer does. But the musical quality is good. It's a glorified radio. I think I would recommend the Dot. Save your money.
1,"Amazon Alexa is a great addition to our home electronics system. Excellent sound from the speakers to play music; useful news and weather reports; controls wifi devices, etc. we live Alexa!"
1,"nice table for the kids. and inexpensive, that's the nice part"
1,We like watching movies and tv shows on the fire stick
1,This was originally for home music - but will be buying some of the home accessories.
1,Bought a few of them on Black Friday for the family. While it's not my iPad it is comparable to any other tablet out there and performs well. The layout is unique which makes it a little difficult to get used to but it's by far worth the money.
0,"No complaints here, especially for the price. Good for children or elderly."
1,My only complaint is that 8GB is really not enough memory if you do audiobooks or videos.
1,I have had many other Bluetooth speakers but when you get one that is smart and can connect to the internet it will change the way you think about them. I love the music streaming. I use the installable skills. Also now using for smart home features. I like this so much I am replacing my other Bluetooth speakers with echo devices.
1,Really good Christmas gift. Would recommend to anyone
1,I bought is item as a family Christmas gift. It gave it to them early. My children absolutely love it and it was perfect for my wife. I've shared my experience with a few friends and they've bought on.
1,"Couldn't be more pleased with my purchase! I've owned other devices in the past, including earlier versions of the Kindle. This one takes the cake. Extremely easy to use, fonts have great clarity, and the backlight feature is so convenient when reading at night. Has some cool features like a dictionary and Wikipedia if you want to look up a word within the text. I would definitley recommend this product!"
1,"Its a great product, easy to use and so easy to carry anywhere !"
1,"Performs much better than the TV Fire Stick gen1 and still able to side load Android apps APK. We were able to load some international apks that allows us to stream TV shows from different countries onto the Fire TV.We could do this with the fire stick to, but occasionally the stream would hang.Not sure if the improved performance is due to upgraded CPU and RAM, or with wired (ethernet) connection (instead of wifi) or both. I got the gen2 TV stick, and even that appear to be performing better. So maybe its more of a upgraded CPU.None of her TV shows have chocked and requires restart yet."
1,Very good product overall. my wife loves it.......
1,Kids love it and the drop-in feature is great. Easy to set up.
1,I purchased this along with the kids version for my two year old grandson this one stays at my hose the Kids version at home with his parents he loves it
1,I bought it for my 2 (almost 3) year old. He really lover it. I love that I can put a timer on it and he can't be on it all day. It's easy to use. The only thing I hate is how fast the battery runs down even if not in use.
1,I absolutely love this product and how they recommend it
1,"I bought one of these in December as an inexpensive back up for an iPad. I sincerely believe that the Fire 7"" tablet is the best bargain I have ever had in an electronic device. I now gift these to my elderly friends who need a simple internet connector."
1,"This was purchased for a secret santa gift, but seems like a great value for the money."
1,This unit is very easy to use and comes with voice activated remote.
0,"Good basic tablet, but already have troubles. Amazon sent a new one."
1,This is a great device that Amazon came out with it will tell you the weather do music for you stock reports you name it
1,"I have a kindle fire, but I wanted something that was less of a strain on my eyes.I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It is simple and easy and I'm able to use my fire as a tablet!"
1,My kids loved the tablet small enough to take along every where I love the time limits I can set on them
1,"We had the Amazon FireTV stick but it was VERY slow and tended to freeze up now and then in the middle of high-definition movies. So, I asked the Best Buy sales person if I would see an improvement with the FireTV box, and he said yes. Sure enough, he was correct. It is SO much better. We are enjoying this product much better than the stick version. It's worth spending the extra money."
1,"These kindle tablets are beginning to get pretty cheap. Especially when the other kids tablets are relatively close in pricing. Nothing has gone wrong with this Kindle as of now, and our niece has been enjoying it. A kids account and adult account is made. The kids accounts has access to whatever the adults account allows. This is pretty standard in kids tablets, but this one handles it well. It makes it much easier."
1,This is one of the best on the market great to watch
1,"I was using my iPad mini to read for a long time, but felt like getting a dedicated device for reading since I am a Prime member. I ended up buying a kindle with no back light... Don't fool yourself, LED lights and book lights do no where near the same job as the Paper white. I can hold the device in one hand for long periods of time and the light doesn't wear my eyes down like my iPad. Really love the Paper white, I'm catching up on a lot more reading."
1,I absolutely love my Amazon Echo and would suggest everyone to get one!
1,"I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR"
1,I bought it as a gift for a business party. I did read the reviews before I bought it and figured I couldn't go wrong. I know it was fought over during the gift exchange!
1,Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.
1,Tablet was exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price.
1,It's great since you can plug into an rj45 connector it's much faster than the fire stick
1,If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.
1,Perfectly packaged with that hi-tech mojo. Works as advertised
1,"Search engine could be better ,but fine for simple questions. Great for playing music."
1,Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product
1,We use this speaker all the time. It's perfect. I would buy this time and time again.
1,Overall wonderful device! From playing music to asking for the time. My favorite feature is being able to turn on my wi-fi devices!!!!
0,"Just got home and found the packet is empty, there is no product we ordered in it. What do we do now"
1,very handy to buy parents or grandparents with reading the numbers of choices on ONE tablet instead of carry 10 books if you are out of state trip like plane.
1,"If you are a Amazon Prime or PlayStation Vue member, this is a must buy. Easy to use connect. Simple log in. Intuitive guide. Small, but not too small. Great remote. Relatively inexpensive. 4k qualityOnly wish I could transfer remote features to my Logitech remote."
1,This is an excellent piece. We use is it mainly for Netflix but there are so many other features yet to explore.
1,Love the options it gives me for minimal cost . I carry it with me when I travel. .
1,Great device. Bought 3 of them for grandkids.. 7 of them have them.
1,This is great for reading books. Works well in sunlight.
1,Great and simple. Not being able to change master search engine beyond 3 offered was the ONLY negative I've experienced.
1,I absolutely love my Amazon box. It's user friendly and affordable. I already have recommended this item to several people.
1,Kindle fire is excellent device I personally have one as do all of my children at this point
1,"When the unit is working, it's everything that you would want. However, the unit needs to be reset often as it will not turn on with the remote. Once you unplug it and plug it back in, it works fine."
1,Great gift for Mother's day for aging parent. Not too difficult to navigate.
0,"I purchased this tablet because it was extremely cheap. I'm not impressed with anything about it. It is slow, not at all user friendly, and the advertising is so very annoying. It is also almost totally useless as it does not support the few apps I use on a regular basis. I will keep it only to access my amazon accounts."
1,This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.
1,"Bought this for my kids before a big road trip. It was a great buy! The battery was good, the tablet is easy to use and navigate. My kids loved it! Would buy again."
1,"Smooth and quick operarion. Ap store for Amazon could be better, but pretty good value for the price."
1,i bought this for my husband and he loves using it
0,"Table overall was ok but after 30 days it wouldn't work, and there was no warranty after 30 for Best Buy so I just waste 30 for nothing"
1,"I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials."
1,Love it bought one for my daughter and ended up buying one for myself
1,"Runs awesome for a good amount of time. Unfortunately sometimes the device disconnects or asks to be refreshed, during that time the remote does not work and it is frozen on that screen. Other than that it runs very fast and is a great unit. The fix for that is unplugging and replugging."
0,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product."
1,Good price for a tablet. I was really impress with all that it could do.
1,"This was a gift for my father, and he loves it. He uses it mostly for music on Spotify of Pandora MD he hooks up his Bluetooth speaker to it."
1,Grandson loves it . He loves to play games and watch movies
1,"good for setting alarm, reading, look up easy stuffs, overall makes like convenient."
1,Setup was much simpler than originally planned and easy to install on non-smart tv
1,"Bought tablet for my dad to use, he is 80 yrs old and has never used a tablet before, he caught on quick. Size was perfect for him to handle."
1,Such a high DPI! looks like printed. the books are much cheaper
1,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.
1,"Excellent amazon fire stick. Set up was a snap. It is great that you can speak into the mic to search for a title of a movie or show, rather than typing it."
1,Decided to go with this along with playstation vue and a couple other subscriptions I already had to cut the cord from cable. This little box is excellent for all sorts of streaming. Shows come in very clear. The response time is great. Only down side is bluetooth and not IR but a nice $20 adapter and boom now my universal remote works with this. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking to cut ties with their cable company.
1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. They love it.
1,This TV is on another level from the firestick or chromecast. Speeds are amazing and can handle anything we try to stream. Great Purchase!
1,Great item to have in your home. Works exactly as advertised. Hopefully it won't become outdated
1,have a kindle with a broken screen. bought originally for 99.00. now regular price is 49.99 and were on sale black Friday for 34.99. got 2 more.
1,I was looking for a replacement to a different tablet that I used only for reading. I am glad that I purchased this -- it does exactly what i want...even in the bright sun.
1,"Ordered it for a friend so that he could do his bible study, n play games n read books . He loves it"
1,I really like the fact that this tablet allows me to look at Facebook and Twitter and such. I'm thinking about passing it down to one of my siblings.
1,"Sound is great. Voice control excellent and works with other ambient noise. Great for music, facts ,news and general info."
1,"My nephew broke his tablet and I thought this one was going to be perfect for him, since he's young he doesn't need a expensive one. It was on sale for Black Friday so I took the advantage and got it on time before Christmas"
1,"The device works great as longer you have a decent Wi Fi, very handy and useful."
1,Great sound quality. Great way to control other smart devices and/or paired equipment.
1,"I already own one and love it. Decided to give one as a gift. Makes it easy to purchase future add on gifts, e.g. Dot, WEMO."
1,My nephew loves his kindle. Durable structure that can withstand drops.
1,"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels"
1,I've always wanted one to read. Good Features and glass for reading
1,"Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they absolutely love it, haven't put it down since they received them...Thanks Best Buy!!!"
1,We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old. He loves it. It's durable and reliable.
1,Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.
1,knowledgeable- courtesy- out of way helpful-professional
1,Initially it has a hard time recognizing your voice but then it adapts and makes everything so much easier. It gives me the daily news and tells bedtime stories.
1,Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!
1,"nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate"
1,This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
1,Cool item. Also purchased the Dot to use upstairs. Very convenient verses finding/picking up the phone. Love the daily Jeopardy questions.
1,This amazon fire tv is a excellent product the box is very Small sitting next to the TVs . The fire tv cost a little more than the stick BUT the processor is must faster.
1,Great little tablet for light surfing and watching shows while cooking. Would be better if had native support for Google Play store.
1,"I had purchased this item before, had to buy a second one , best streaming device on market"
1,"I have never been a fan of ""smart"" tvs, the interfaces of the best are terrible...The firetv interface is clean, fast and does what i want with relatively little fuss. These are a little more money than the firetv sticks, but much faster and have USB ports for wireless keyboards"
1,"Bought this for my daughter (7 yrs), and ended up getting a second one for my son. I do wish Best Buy sold the kid-proof cases, but meh.The tablet is quick, the memory is expandable as well, which is what keeps me from anything iWhatever. Throw a 64GB card in this and your kid can make videos on Musical.ly all dang day and become a YouTube sensation (still waiting on that check).PARENTAL NOTE: If you go this route, take advantage of Amazon's FreeTime. It's fantastic, customizable, safe and easy to stay hands-off. I use it with both tablets with both kids. Time limits, no questionable content (depending on what you call questionable; i hate KidzBop) and excellent apps, etc included.Tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting, too, so if you despise kids, you can still enjoy your lonely, hollow, selfish existence with this outstanding tablet."
1,I bought this to replace my granddaughter broken tablet. Cheap enough but good quality
1,Great for kids. Lots of games and books for kids..
1,Love this base for charging my kindle. You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge. With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes.
1,Love this amazon fire. Great talking piece for the newbies. Easy to install
1,I like it and it does almost everything that I ask.
1,"Great addition to smart home. Seamless integration with smartthings hub, hue lights, and Rachio Sprinkler controller."
1,Great sharp pictures and easy navigation. Enjoy the different background option for my books.
1,"Absolutely loving my Amazon Echo...""Alexa""Don't know how I lived without her for so long! Shehelps me cook dinner...always a joke to tell...and keeps track ofmy shopping list..to do list...and a whole lot more!"
1,Works incredibly!!! I will never go back to cable/satellite again!!!
1,Happy that I made this purchase and will recommend it....can't be beat cause I only paid $40
1,I love this tablet for my 5 and 7 year olds!!! They have tons of kid friendly games that keeps them busy for hours
1,My son uses this and he has no problem with navigation of the tablet. It does everything he needs.
1,Light weight is great. Screen is a little too small for some games.
1,Echo and Alexa are so ez and do so much....more than I can use but much I have to learn. AWESOME. THANKS
1,This is a great little Tablet for the price. Easy to use.
1,Purchased for my younger children to do learning games. My last one purchased was for a 4 year old and she loves it. Very durable.
1,"Works great for checking the weather, checking your calendar, playing music and asking questions."
1,"I love reading books this way. This is my 3rd Kindle. My first was the one with the keyboard, then I got a Kindle HD. I wanted to be able to read outdoors so I bought the Paperwhite. I love it."
1,"Bought for family member, was on their Christmas list."
1,Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend
0,Over all the product is good and works as advertised but lately it is constantly having issues keeping enet connection and even worse has issues updating. We were told this is a larger amazon network issue.
1,"If youre choosing between this and the apple tv , I find this to better as long as you dont plan on connecting things through the cloud."
1,"This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it."
1,The only thing is you need to do is subscribe to Amazon music. It doesn't come with Prime
1,I'm gradually learning all of the features the Kindle Fire has and am enjoying the books I've downloaded.
1,"The primary use is for Playstation Vue. The unit works very well and I have no regrets leaving Direct TV, so much cheaper. I haven't noticed a quality drop and am very happy with how the fire tv works."
1,I gave this as a gift . A took a bit to get used to because it's not an Android. All and All a good buy.
0,"I got this stuff for myself to watch Netflix, YouTube"
1,"Works for most things it is advertised for. Weather, music, daily update, ordering, or my kid's favorite, ""Alexa, tell me a joke"". I wish it was at least decent with responding to general search questions, this is where it really seems to lack. I get a response to about 20%-30% of the things I ask. Will see if one of the other devices on the market can do this better."
1,I've seen this devise from a friend and was really impressed with its performance. It was delightful and fun to see it worked. I bought it at the right tim when it went on sale.
1,"My son trys to claim them all as his own . We own a Amazon Fire 7 tablet , Amazon 7 Kids Safe Fire Tablet and a amazon 8 HD tablet and he thinks all of them are his ."
1,Great inexpensive product for the price. Just like the Kindle Fire HDX except for no mayday function. Both front and rear cameras are a plus. Love the Amazon kindle fire
1,Purchased for each grandchild to use. So far they seem very pleased
1,Its cool for kids and safe with the case if your kid dropped
0,Didn't do all that I wanted it to but it is sufficient for my 8 year old son.
1,"I am very pleased with the purchase. I use Alexa to listen to my favorite TuneIn radio station in a foreign country, set timers when I'm cooking, ask the time in different cities in the world or basic culture questions. She responds to everything. If I want to play music, she will default to Amazon Prime. If you have the membership, it is very convenient to have Alexa. I have even placed orders on Amazon with my voice. I also have Hue lights so Alexa is the one turning off my house lights at the end of the day...ah, and I can ask her to do so from the upstairs level. I think this purchase is one of the best I've made this year. I am sure there is much more to tap on (no pun intended), and I'll find out as I use Echo more. For now, I totally recommend."
1,Gir two for my sisters well worth the $50. Simple present for anyone
1,Frustrated that it has a hard time understanding me.
1,I already had a Fire Tablet for my own use. I got one for my husband and he loves it.
1,"I had a wink hub which i stopped using long time back as it was clunky, so when i saw the new echo i thought i will give it a try. Now not a day goes by when i dont use the Echo. I have connected my Kasa lights to Alexa, my phone, Bluetooth speakers (anything and everything). You can just ask Echo to turn off lights, turn it on, connect to your phone etc and Alexa will just do it. No more pulling out ur phone to play music!!!!"
1,I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
1,It is fun for my whole family. It truly improves with learning
1,I didn't realize what I was missing until I bought one! Love this thing! Makes being in my kitchen so much more pleasant because answers are right at my fingertips! And I have access to so much music! Buying several as Xmas presents!
1,"Easy to use, light, sturdy. Purchased case on ebay. Great price. Wish it would work with chromecast. Sketchy Fios updates but resolved."
1,"I like this a lot for an entry level tablet. I am able to watch videos and set it up to read books. There is some lag at times but nothing too bad. I had to add a memory card because the 8GB is small. Some apps can be downloaded to the memory card but it does optimize itself and will create space on the hard drive. The ads are only on the lock screen, never when using the tablet."
1,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. Once she opened it and set it up, I decided that I needed one as well. She is married and they use it all of the time. Easy to use. I would highly recommend this product."
1,"loved it, it is exactly what I needed for my granddaughter she can play unlimited games"
1,The Kindles were good while they worked 3 days!! Best Buy was good about replacing them. Very frustrating though to have to get them replaced when my kids only played on them for three days.
1,This tablet works wondeful and it is perfect for children who are learning to read and do math.
1,I use this in bedroom. I have the fire stick also. The fire stick didn't work as well in bedroom but this fire tv is great. I like the voice controlled feature as well. Easy to use and set up.
1,The tablet was cheap and a great deal. The kids love it. It is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.
1,very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months
1,Smooth UI... much quicker & less laggy than the Fire TV Stick. Streams 4k as well so can't go wrong.
1,"This is my second Echo. The family just love it. Using IFTTT, I have it working with so many other devices. I just wish I could set the address to outside of the US."
1,Got these for the neices and nephews they love them.
1,"Every day Alexa learns new skills. She sets the temperature on my Nest, waters my lawn, times my cooking, keeps my shopping list, etc. The only problem I have had is when I listen to Jeopardy and a woman contestant answers with ""WHO IS ..."" Alexa answers."
0,"Found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it. It's a listening device in my home that won't do anything unless I pay more into Amazon. The fact that I synced my pandora account is pointless because I have to spell out what I want Alexa to play by saying, ""Alexa play 'X' station from my pandora play list."" How is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when I am the only one who knows my pandora play list (and barely at that!) I have many complaints, and basically disappointed in my purchase. I was lead to believe this was the radio of the future. It is if I pay for the Amazon Music Unlimited monthly."
1,"I love my new kindle! I can read books, read email, shop online and play games!"
1,"I love that I can play all my Pandora stations with just one command! Sound quality is excellent, she'll change the volume with a simple request. She hasn't been so quick to answer all my questions, but I may not be asking correctly. Makes phone calls from my iPhone. Really fun."
1,I bought this for my 7 yr old and she just loves it.
1,Great if you just want to read and occasionally browse the web. Great value!
1,"In this case - the answer is yes. Amazon beat google by a long shot. The google product doesn't match up. Amazon has done a great job integrating with other home security products as well as the hue, nest etc... On top of that the voice recognition is second to none. If you're an amazon account holder you can order with it, if you're a prime member you can access it's music (you can anyway, just get more with prime). Also plays well with other apps like Pandora. It's great... beats google hands down."
1,I love it because it saves me money. Easy to use. Great value.
1,"This just is so much fun to use. So easy to ask for music to be played. Quality is good too. We ask about our sports teams and ask for jokes. We just sit and laugh at how this works. We are just starting to use it for our shopping list. We used to use OneNote, but it is so easy to ask Alexa to add a product to the shopping list. She repeats it and has always gotten it right. You can also add it manually on the app. We love playing around with it and are learning new commands."
1,Short on memory but easily expands with memory stick. Works great for everyday tasks.
1,I bought this for my wife when she lost her kindle on vacation. Easy to set up and start using. Amazon customer service is also excellent!
1,"I am able to see my Directv, Netflix, and amazon prime all in one system."
1,My 12 year old son loves this kindle fire. Does everything it's supposed too and more.
1,Had one in the past and it was stolen. So glad I could get this st a good price.
1,"a good device, better voice assistant apps and commands"
1,Alexa is handy and a lot smarter than I thought it would be. I can also see it being used for homework for the answer and not the formula. We can't stop that. Nice addition to the living room.
1,I needed something to read kindle books on and to watch occasional videos with. This inexpensive tablet packs a lot of features for a great price. Does everything I ask of it.
1,So easy to use and so nice to have in kitchen. Looks great in white
1,Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
1,I bought the Amazon Fire as a gift and it works great. If you want a tablet that is not expensive and will work for games this would be a great choice.
1,"I was thinking about to get a device to read on train or buses. Kindle paperwhite is the best for me when compared with others such as cellphone or tablet. And even in this latest model, it has higher display density and brightness control, which is what I want.So go ahead, get one, worth to have your trip full of fun."
1,So Good had to buy another one. This is the second echo I have idecided to put one in the master bedroom as well as the main house great decision
1,It's super easy to use and it looks good next to the tv with its sleekness. We have had no problems with it as of yet.
1,I like the product I purchased actually purchased a second one I just have other concerns with Best Buy
1,"I bought this for my husband to replace his original Kindle. The lighted background and light weight makes it perfect for reading in bed. The added features of Internet and numerous apps make it perfect for so many uses. It is easy to manage and the grandkids also love using it for the games. It has a great camera, too! Overall very pleased."
1,"This is just great I use it daily and am very happy, This is my fourth echo and all work flawlessly"
1,I use it everyday after work for down time.........
1,Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.
1,"great product, especially if you have Amazon Prime"
1,It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
1,"My husband gave this to me for our vacation to Hawaii. It was nice and lightweight to read on the plane in the dark, and on the beach in the bright sunlight. Love it!"
1,Great sound and smart just wish the volume didnt have to b manually turned.
1,"Nice Tablet, Easy to use and setup. This is most buy."
1,"I like my tablet very much ,it does all the things I need it for, but the battery charge don' last long enough."
1,A brilliant tablet that has further raised the bar for the rest of the competition
1,Great product for Basic use. Runs well for the price of $50.
1,I got this for a friends son the only problem with it is he won't put it down LOL
1,"Gave as a Christmas gift. Don't know how good it works, or anything about it"
1,bought for my 7 year old it has held up to her expectations which at times might be higher than mine as kids show far less patience.
1,I love being able to add items to my grocery list or listen to a particular song whenever I want.
0,My son really likes this tablet. He wishes it was a little bit bigger screen size
1,The absolute best streaming device I've ever used.
1,This was perfect for my 11 year old to take on our trip cross country.
1,Great for streaming TV/ movies. I hardly ever have interruptions.
1,Best thing ever I have one in all my rooms in the house
1,Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets
1,No words can explain what im viewing. I can now watch tv +more
1,Is a good choice and product just need more channels
1,Great product. The smart home integration is amazing.
1,"This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself."
1,Purchased for my husbands Kindle. He loves the way the built in stand works.
1,I love the voice controled volume. Having it synced up with my apps and the internet makes for great hsnds free information getting.
1,I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
1,Amazon Fire Tablet was an excellent purchase. Great display and very easy to use
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great tool for home automation. Works with Nest device, TP-Link wall plugins and various other items with ease."
1,I was looking for a tablet for my niece and I got it for 37 $$ no other deal can beat this
1,I bought this as a gift for a family member and she loved it. Great simple tablet.
1,"Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now."
1,Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use.
0,"It is a nice tablet for the price. The camera is not that great but it is decent. Beware of the memory capacity though. It says that it holds 8 gb but only has 3.81 gb of free space, so less than half."
1,"Works great for Vue, and other apps if you don't have a smart TV. Better quality on Vue than my PS4"
1,"Bought this as a family Christmas present but was concerned that we would not really use it. Boy was I wrong. I request music on it all the time, check the weather, confirm my calendar and the kids are constantly asking it questions. Well worth the money!"
1,Great price for this tablet. My son enjoys this tab
1,"I love my Amazon fire 7 tablet. I gave one to my grandson, and he loves it too!"
1,My son likes his amazon fire tablet and its loud he's hearing impaired its great for him
1,great - can charge Kindle e-book reader without the need of computer being on.
1,Perfect starter tablet; just right for kids to use
1,Love my new Amazon Fire Tablet! Love to read and this was perfect for me!
1,I bought this to read books on. Excellent for that. Difficult to navigate otherwise
1,"I love just saying to play a particular album, or songs from a particular artist, or specific music such as Jazz."
1,"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled."
1,"I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad!"
1,Alexa is wonderful to have-I love asking it questions and listening to my favorite songs.
1,"This tablet is great for the price & an easy way to read books, too!"
1,"Works well. It was easy to set up. My only complaint is that it's a hassle to load applications that don't come with it. I loaded Xfinity to go on it, and it was very difficult to use, as it doesn't fit the screen right. Great idea, too many glitches with new software. I would recommend getting a mini bluetooth keyboard. It was easy to connect, and works well with this."
1,Siri is great but Alexa takes hints up a notch. I have gotten Philips Hue bulbs and love that I can control lights throughout my house by just asking Alexa to manage them.
1,I'm pleased with my tablet and service received at your store.
1,"I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page."
1,"Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7"". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven't seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast."
1,"Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
1,We love the shopping list feature. The timer is great too. We feel spoiled!
0,Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
1,"Amazon Echo is truly awesome. Better than Google Home in my experience. It's just an awesome device to have around the house. Highly recommend, 10/10!"
1,"I love Alexa so much, it makes my life easier. Perfect device if you're planning to automate your house. The price is reasonable and affordable to every class."
1,"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
1,I love this tablet i got it for my grandson and the minute he comes through the door he wants his tablet it keeps him busy
1,I like to buy my ink cartridges at Best Buy because of the recycling program.
1,"I purchased a new Kindle because i sat on the last one. I was trying to decide on whether to get the paperwhite version, and so very glad i did. The ability to add light during periods of shade with bright sun behind or at dusk is really a great benefit"
1,Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
1,Paperwhite is light. Light feature is a must for night readers. No paper! No more trips to the library. The library is in your hands. 8 months and counting with no issues! Can't go wrong with amazon products! Why are you still reading this review? Go to your local best buy and purchase me the amazon kindle paperwhite now!
1,Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire.
1,"If you want an e book reader that is light, easy on the eyes (even in the dark) with a no-glare are screen, then you will love this one. It works well even in bright sunlight!. Battery life is great! (days) My only issue is than I have not had any luck using my phone (Galaxy s5)as a hotspot to download books. Very frustrating that it will not recognise it for wifi connection, even manually typing it in! It's browser capabilities are also a joke. I shop with my phone or laptop then drive to a wifi location to download books. Not ideal. That said, it is a wonderful ""reader"" even though it is overpriced! Good luck shopping :-)"
1,"I bought this to replace my Nook reader, $50 for a Fire vs $140 for a new Nook was a no brainer. I had to use Calibre to convert some epub books to mobile format on the Fire, but that was easy. The ability to use WiFi to check email, surf the web, it's miles ahead of the black and white Nook."
1,I had the best experience at the Best Buy I went to. They were so helpful and took their time with me.
1,"Purchased this tablet at a great price! This tablet works very well within the amazon ecosystem, so it is best geared towards those with amazon prime. It has micro sd card slot which is a plus."
1,Easy to use and does what you ask. Has a lot of knowledge and is full of information. Was amazed at what Alexa can do.
1,Fun gadget that has more uses than I realized. A++
1,"read the reviews, bought this tablet to replace an e-reader. Way more than I expected. Video was better than reviews stated, books load faster than my old one Still getting used to a new OS but I am very pleased"
1,amazing tab for a gift. right priced and the performance is great. it is really helpful for browsing and basic activities
1,"I love this, the backlight makes reading in bed or low lighting easy. No need to keep the light on and my husband awake. No eyestrain"
1,Love the ease to download apps and music. The size is perfect and it lights up pretty well
1,"I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet."
1,Great product. I have a lot to learn about echo. The echo keeps learning as you talk to you.
1,"Bought as a gift for spouse. We are just beginning to explore the functions, but seems to have a lot of capabilities."
0,"It is a nice, cheap, small tablet to keep around for vids, Fire TV remote, etc."
1,"Bought it for the price and my mother-in-law has one, keeps freezing up but st good."
1,"Love these, great cable cutter. A little glitchy on the remote but really good product"
1,This kindle fire tablet was perfect gift for child she is 3 years old bit can work it and loves it
1,"If you are already an active Amazon prime member, kindle book buyer, etc. this is a no-brainer buy if you need an inexpensive tablet. High quality materials are used with a great deal of functionality at a very reasonable price point."
1,Great price for tablet. My college son purchased these with his money to donate to city after school program for low income kids. Kids love them and are learning to read more! Tons of educational and fun stuff on Amazon Fire!
1,"Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too."
1,"Kindle Fire 7"" is affordable for everyone!$! Love it!!!"
1,"After having to return the stick, the Fire TV works perfectly highly recommended."
1,"I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present. She loves it, much better than the old Sony reader she had which had limited books and was much more expensive."
1,I love asking Alexa questions and getting the answers quickly. Music is unlimited. Always know the latest news and weather without turning on a tv.
1,"got the product during the thanks giving sales, good buy. The product is used primarily for reading, it does the job very well"
1,"I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself."
1,Had some issues but now it's fine and we have a lot of fun using alexa
1,Bought this tablet on black Friday and I'm very happy with it. Haven't even touched my ipad since buying this little guy.
1,"Very powerful, tablet, can do so much with it, love it! Love the kindle, so many titles available."
1,I had a fire stick that I was having issues with connectivity. I didn't really want to spend the extra money but I'm so glad I did this thing is fast and the remote works like a champ
1,"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode."
1,Very easy to use and fast. Menu is set up in a user friendly way.
1,Bought this 1 because of the camera and good price
1,"So many ways to use this. Easy, fun, and helpful to have around."
1,Purchased Fire TV while at Best Buy and this item was on sale. The Fire TV compared to the Fire Stick is much better.
1,"It's good, but even if you have prime you have to pay an additional monthly for music.. just another way to make money"
1,"Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price."
1,"added more memory downloaded movie and shows to the fire and went on vacation it was perfect, also found out you can download amazon prime movies to watch offline, That is awesome for travel"
1,Excellent value and popular for all ages.Great for reading books and browsing the internet
1,Ordering from Amazon is simpler than ever. Use this in any room for sound as well when you aren't making an order.
1,Good product just disappointed I can use the music off my phone I have to pay for a app with in the product which suck
1,"The high resolution screen is noticeably easier to read, and the user interface is well thought out."
1,I love Alexa. Cannot wait to set up smart home and fully utilize all that Alexa has to offer. The Amazon music feature is a wonderful bargain!
1,"I only bought this because I wanted to give my friend one and she wasn't getting the new one, lol! I had heard there wasn't much difference between them so didn't plan to buy one before. They were wrong. It is SO much faster. Going into the store, browsing, turning pages and opening books. I used to get aggravated at the lag time and rarely bought books on it, used my phone to buy, because it was so annoyingly slow to respond. Speed was the first thing I noticed, the screen looks a bit clearer though I was happy with the old one's screen too. It's worth the upgrade."
1,"I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a "" two toned"" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay."
1,All I wanted was a reader and this is the perfect solution. Love me Kindle Fire but not great as a reader.
1,"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!"
0,"The first one I bought had a battery failure. It wouldn't charge. Best Buy graciously supported me with a replacement. I like the tablet. Two enhancements that would be nice on it are 1) Speech to text capability and 2) Google Playstore preloaded.If you're using it for reading and internet browsing it is very good.Also, Alex (She) gave me great customer support. Kudos Alex!"
1,Love the screen great price and keeps my son entertained. He enjoys his short videos and pictures
1,The product worked just as it was advertised meeting all my expectations
1,I love my echo. There's not much you can't ask Alexa. Very informative.Great sound when listening to music. And the games are fun to play with friends. I wouldn't trade it for nothing else!
0,Perfect for light surfing and reading. Don't expect much for this price range.
1,"The original Amazon Echo packs quite a bit into one cylinder. The sound is so much more than you'd expect, the voice recognition software is excellent, and there's so much it can do. I recommend using it with Amazon Prime to get the most out of the music. This also works well with Philips Hue lighting."
1,Previously had two Roku devices and ended up switching both to Fire TV's. Interface feels much better and apps seam to respond better on this than the Roku.
1,"This replaced an original fire stick. It works good enough for us to cancel our cable tv. If it's not Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, or the antenna we don't need to see it."
1,"It's the echo. Performs as expected. No issues, does what it says. If you want to have a better relationship with Alexa, u can chat one on one."
1,Purchased this for daughter as a first tablet. She loves it and it is easy to use. Plus it won't break the bank for a great quality tablet.
1,Bought this for my young cousins and they love it!
1,this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
1,"I use my Echo everyday. Alexa has become part of my life from telling me the time, the weather, playing music, setting timers and alarms, giving me a news brief, turning my lights or portable heater on/off, playing games, and so much more. Her voice control works very well and is very responsive. The sound quality is very good. New skills are automatically added all the time."
1,Granddaughter loved it! It was a present for Christmas.
1,"I did not use more than internet, for that works perfect"
1,Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Our son is loving his tablet. Perfect size and cost.
1,I love this more than my Apple TV. It works well with plex and its all I need.
1,Well worth the money..............................
1,This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids.
1,"I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad."
1,"Perfect color, size and price for our family needs."
1,This tablet has all apps needed for anyone. only one things not working with this tablet - this is some apps GPS.
1,This cord works great! I also love that it is longer than the original cord. The USB is a good thing to have because you could take it with you and plug it into any USB port.
1,"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things."
1,Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
1,My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!
1,"Great tablet. Easy to read the screen, fast. Great price."
1,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my wife for her birthday. She doesn't always have an easy time with technology, so I wanted to make sure that it was simple to use. The Paperwhite was very easy to set up and she downloaded two books the first day, one from the library and one purchased. She now takes it everywhere with her and loves it. Mission Accomplished."
1,"Very good product with many new features each week. Good learning tool for young children with teaching mathematics, history etc."
1,I saw Echo at my cousin's one day and by the next I had one! There was a short learning curve but we (The Echo and I) achieved it!
1,Great to use and I like the larger screen. It is fast and easy to use.
1,This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.
1,"Echo is a great product on its own, but even better when integrated with home control like Wink. Voice control of lights is the way of the future!"
1,"It is useful and quite light weight. This tablet is much more than my expectation. Besides, my eyes feel very comfortable to read article on it."
0,"I have a pretty fast and stable internet connection, 65Mbps down.So when I tried to stream some 4K content, it kept buffering to the point that it just wouldn't load the video anymore. Even streaming 1080p content had some issues. So i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if I had the same problem, nope. It worked flawlessly! This product just plain sucks."
1,Great product and excellent battery life. The backlight is an added bonus that I didn't know I need or wanted until I had.
1,I replaced my Roku boxes with the Fire TV as I prefer its interface.
1,I bought this for my wife for Christmas she loves it . Sounds great
1,I have read books on my phone and IPad and Kindle.....but rarely would read long due to disraction of other apps and email.....or couldn't read outside because of glare.....well this product has solved all my problems.....no distractions....just read and read for hours now....and can comfortably read outside or on the back end of our motorcylce if I want becasue NO GLARE!!!!! Love it :)
1,This is a great all around tablet. This tablet is currently being used by my daughter and she loves it. It's a good size and the picture quality is good enough to watch cartoons and a few YouTube videos on. The best part is that it has a memory slot so you can save videos on it for travel.
1,I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far.
1,It is very user friendly. Recommend for most ages.
1,Great tablet and really great for kids i highly recommend it
0,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
1,"I debated on what tablet/reader to buy and decided on the fire! I have been very pleased with it. Bought it on sale, what a great price!"
1,Great purchase and good investment.Also wonderful viewing
1,"Original purchase for Amazon Fire HD 8 32 GB model put on backorder and cancelled by local Elk Grove CA Best Buy store. Purchased Amazon Fire HD 8 16 GB model from local Best Buy store. A total of $29.99 Sales Tax, Fees & Surcharges were not returned from original Order Number: BBY01-800223005180. Why was the $29.99 not returned? The Amazon Fire HD 8 16 GB (6th Generation) works good."
1,great value as a beginner's tablet for a young person.
0,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
1,I love my Echo! There are so many features i havent even gotten to use yet. I recommend highly!
1,This product will allow me to cut the cable cord and save significant dollars. I can choose and pay for only what I want.
0,"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
1,I purchased this box as a replacement for my Roku 2 box and it is awesome. Can do all the things that Roku cannot do. Best decision ever made in terms of my electronics.
1,I returned one of my cable boxes and just use my AMZN fire. I love that I can use the voice command. Super easy set up.
1,"Set up was Extreamly easy. Hooks up well with other products like TrackR, Nest and Phillips Hue. Most of all my wife gets all her songs by just asking for them. When she forgets where her phone is she simply ask it to have TrackR ring her phone and when she's cold or hot she just asks for it to be warmer or cooler."
1,Purchased this on cyber Monday and it was worth it. Alexa is my new best friend.
1,"Brought 1 for my neice, nephew, and child they ‚ù§ it"
1,Love the echo i use it for Music and news and shopping...the sound is pretty dang! Good too...2thumbs up echo
1,I'm writing a review based on the problem I had with my Kindle HD 8.9 it would not hold a charge even though Amazon try to reboot it from their location or had to technician try to reboot it but it wouldn't come on so I'm just want to say that the charger does work when I plugged it into my Samsung phone with the power cord so that's why I give it 5 stars
1,So many awesome things to do with Alexa! Be sure to read about it though
1,I love Alexa! This product is very versatile. It fills the room with sound.
1,I bought the echo to use in my kitchen because it doesn't take up much space. Wasn't sure how we would like it but it has been great.Anytime someone goes in the kitchen they have it on. Ther is always music playing.The sound is really good also. There is so many things that Alexa can do but we haven't even tried yet. She tells us the weather every day. You can also time more than one thing when you are cooking and that is really great. We are very happy with our purchase.
1,I love this thing. I had one of the original ones before I got this one and I love that one. So when I got this it blew me away. So many new functions still so reliable. And now I can read in the dark. Amazing.
1,suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion
1,"All the apps you need and they keep adding more , and now with the Amazon echo Alexa you can control your smart devices by saying "" Alexa turn on my lights , or TV or Shades or music or locks I mean it's endless even my Sonos. Get this thing , Apple or Chrome can't touch this at all."
1,Got this for the wife for x-mass does a lot of cool stuff she love it does every thing she wants and more
1,It's not as easy to use but battery life is great. It's just taking time for me to get used to it.
1,Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
1,"Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
1,My little 8 year old guy loves this kindle. Couldn't imagine a better Christmas gift.
1,Santa brought three of these tablets to our boys and they absolutely love them. What an incredible product and you can't beat the price point. Perfect for the little screen time that they do get and I love that I can control what they have access to. You can even set requirements for reading time in order to unlock the ability to play games. Great tablet.
1,Purchased this along with the fire stick and the fire tv works way better
1,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and the uses are endless
1,Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
1,"Our Alexa has become like family! She's been a great asset and such a huge help. From ordering pizza, to telling me the weather, making shopping lists, and playing our favorite music and so much more!"
1,"I have several devices I could read on, but I like to read outside on the deck, at the park, by the pool, etc., and I can't stand glare. The Paperwhite is perfect for reading outside. It also has a backlight feature so I can read in the car at night or in the bed without disturbing the wife. The Paperwhite is the perfect e-reader if you want something with no glare, very lightweight, and one that works seamlessly with Amazon. As a Prime member with Kindle Unlimited, my Kindle Paperwhite is my go-to reader for everything."
1,I love my echo she is so nice. And its nice to have someone to talk to sometimes
1,I basically just brought it for my child to play with. I didn't want to pay a lot of money for a tablet so this was the way to go.
1,"Amazon is a cool products, a talking toy not just for kids. Use it daily."
1,Bought tablet for my daughter and she loves it. Also I play it a lot. On it now writing this review
1,"Bought this for my son who is 3. He loves it. Compared to an iPad isn't not great, but for $50, it's pretty great."
1,"Wonderful selection of movies, TV series, etc. Variety of programming has something for everybody"
1,"Amazon Fire tv is the best ""smart tv box"" available. The box is now 4K video capable and uses the android operating system. Plenty of apps already installed and tons more available. Setup was simple and the menus are a breeze to navigate, especially with voice search."
1,It is a great simple tablet. Easy to use anyone can use it it.
1,Bought this for a plane ride to watch some YouTube's and Twitch streams. Would buy another.
1,"This tablet give you the opportunity of everything, surf the web, email, music, games, etc."
1,I went into store to inquire on differences between Apple TV models. Sales person answered my questions but also suggested I consider FireStick. educate yourself before purchasing.
0,It's a really cool device with a ton of apps but it often will freeze if left on to long
1,This was on my son's wish list and it worked as he'd hoped. He was also able to add some apps to make this product even more versatile.Great Black Friday deal.
1,This item is perfect for young kids it keeps them busybody
1,"This is a great tablet for a very reasonable cost. The only place the ads show is on the home screen, once you open to the operating system the ads are gone. If you just want to surf the web, or do some reading this is the device for you."
1,"I got the Echo for Christmas and hooked it up at my house. Hooked up all the automated/wi-fi devices I had, bought more just because they're fun and loved it. Then I decided I wanted a nice, compact music player for my office and started to evaluate options. After reviewing and valuing based on my needs, my office, and ease I decided to get another Echo for the office. The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream. I got it, hooked it up to the office wi-fi and use it every day. It gives me the weather forecast, traffic status, miscellaneous information, but most of all, streaming music.And when the phone rings I can pause it quickly using the voice control and then resume when I'm done. That's what turned me away from the Tap."
1,It does what was expected and glad I got thisbinsteadbof the next level up because of the difference in features is not worth the difference in price.
0,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment
1,"I enjoy moving night, and it kept becoming a hassle deciding what movies to watch, or what medium I would need to rent them. With the firestick, you have all the movies and shows at your disposal, which makes my life so much easier. What a great find. I am glad word of mouth helped me find this product, and would recommend it to anyone."
1,Lacks a lot of the info so readily available on Google Home
1,Great for outside reading. My iPad has been good too with the kindle app but can't see well in bright light. This fixes that.
1,This is a very good product with good performance and value.
1,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
1,Inexpensive and light-weight. Very nice. Brightness for reading is appropriate.
0,Ordered dec 9th and got my order AFTER CHRISTMAS and it was supposed to be delivered on dec 17th
1,I was looking for a cheap tablet and i just love it is like having a a $200 tablet it works the same.
1,The price of this tablet is excellent and the specifications ar√© very well
1,It works really well with a lot of really cool features. It is still missing a few things that the Google home has (maps). But it is still better than the Google home.
1,Nice inexpensive tablet for my kid. I put some movies on it and she was very happy on a 4 hour trip.
1,works fine
0,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
1,I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
1,A must have for your baby or child!! 100% Free apps!!
1,My kid loves this! It was one of his favorite Christmas presents.
1,This product works great and it was a present that she seemed to love.
1,"Very easy and comfortable to use, almost use it every day. I would recommend this to anyone loves a book."
0,"Thought this came without special offers, the staff told me it didn't. Amazon had a sale on this when I bought it, and I thought I was just getting the same deal, but I had to pay $20 later to get rid of the ads"
1,Great inexpensive option for kids for continually break electronics.
1,My children like to read and they wanted something they could have books on. This tablet allows for games as well without having the need to spend hundreds. It does the job for highschool.
1,"Chicago's Fabulous Fountains is a big disappointment. I read about it and expected beautiful pictures. Instead, there is a lot of print.Hamilton is the kind of book I like--history. Chernow always writes very interesting biographies--I've read several others."
1,Excellent tablet and you can't beat the price. Make great gifts for Birthdays or for Christmas.
1,This is one of the best tablets in this price range.
1,"I broke my Kindle Voyage after almost two years. My heart was as broken as the glass cover!After looking at the latest line of Kindles I decided to try the latest Paperwhite as it had the same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper. Plus, a white model to match my other white/silver gadgets! It does have a few less LEDs for backlighting, no flush glass cover (but that is what broke), no auto-adjusting light (that never quite worked anyway), squeezy sides, and a tiny bit heavier/bigger than the Voyage. The Voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazy-expensive Kindle uses leather and has no not-leather option for people who don't like their high tech wrapped in animal skins. So instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone, I sprung for the Paperwhite.I've been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me. I don't miss the glass cover as much as I thought I would, although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out. The screen is great, doesn't clash with the white casing, and although not quite as even a backlight as the Voyage, still much better value for what you get. The software is essentially the same, and Amazon has been slowly improving Kindle software for all the recent models.If you like Amazon for books, I highly recommend this Kindle. You can't beat it for price/value and it really doesn't feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books."
1,Gave this to my son-in law. Perfect gift . He loves the paperwhite
1,Alexa is more useful if you have Amazon prime only
1,"Alexa from Amazon offers amazing functionality including having access to Amazon's music library, it can control your Hue lighting, has the ability to provide news and weather forecasts and it even sets timers when you are cooking! The product is a must have!"
1,I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
1,This device is a classic reader for peopleÔºå also a good gift for students. It is very comfortable to use it.
1,I wasn't sure if I would like having one but LOVE IT!
0,Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.
1,"Bought the kids edition, decided to buy one for myself. Great item for streaming movies and checking social media."
1,"This is perfect for those that just want to read books anytime, anywhere! Great battery life."
1,I got this tablet for my nephews so they could play games and it is a good tablet!
1,This tablet is great for kids and is easy to set up and operate. Great price! Bought durning Black Friday weekend but Best Buy still had them available for the whole weekend!
1,I purchased 5 units as gifts to my nephews and nieces and they love it!
0,"Fast. Almost no buffering. Overall a great product. But only complaint is it's seriously slanted toward Amazon Prime. For instance, I have AMC through a cable subscription. Then why do I need to pay again for episodes on the Amazon AMC app? So stupid. With Roku, I don't need to pay anything extra for episodes I'm already entitled to."
0,got this newer charger as it was indicated to charge faster than the one that came with my fire hdx 8.9 4th generation tablet. well i am currently using this new charger and am getting alerts on the fire tablet that i am hooked up to a low power charger it is plugged directly into the wall socket with the 5ft micro-usb cable i also just bought for it. this is not right. is it junk is it false advertising is the fire tablet wrong in its notification what is the deal amazon. i have been a loyal user but this is really not right.
1,I love this tablet for kids .. it's so much fun for them .. great buy ...
1,"Don't know why I waited so long to purchase this! Thinking about cutting the cord to cable,( pricing is way to high.) Purchase of the fire tv is the first step. I love it there is so much to do. I am a prime member so a lot is included with my prime membership. Movies, tv shows and music, I just can't get enough. It has lived up to an d surpassed my expectations."
0,"Takes to many requests for Alexa to understand what you want. Have to ask several different ways to get most radio stations. When you ask for Rush Limbaugh, you get country music stations. Alexa must be sending me a message."
1,This is a fun gadget to play with and wow your friends. Able to find info on web about 80% of time. Great at retrieving weather info.Don't place near active TV. Ads for Alexa will trigger device.
1,"Me and my brother brought this for our mother on Mothers Day. She can't put this thing down, shout out to Amzon for this amazing product."
1,This is working very well so far.
1,"Works very well. it's fast and responsive. When i saw that it's quad core and has micro sd card i snapped it up, and couldn't be happier with it!"
1,Enjoy all of the products features. Including using hue lights
1,"I got this because I could not read my books on my iPad at the beach. This allows me to read in the sun. Best product ever, great price"
1,Purchased for my nephew and niece for the holidays. They love it.
1,Good solid adaptor to fit the Kindle Paperwhite.
1,Basically it does everything that adult Amazon tablet does
1,Love it save money on a fire stick instead of direct tv
0,"This is a great tablet for kids. I like the fact that it is not expensive, in case it is lost or broken. I bought a second tablet for my son and it works great!"
0,"All the static about this item, not sure why. I did get a better deal buying two. Cant wait to gift it to someone. it appears a lot of my questions go unanswered."
1,"I am happy that i purchased this tablet because it has become very useful when i do my studying and for social media. it is a cute size so it fits in my purse easily . The only reason i do not give it 5 stars is because it doesnt have the ability to add some apps such as chegg, snapchat and among others."
1,"I start out with one tablet and love it so much, end up bought 3 more. The tablet is very nice for kids."
1,"Bought her for my son and daughter, Just love Alexa"
1,You will get your money worth. Great to carry anywhere
1,Great for streaming movies and music to your Smart TV!! Especially if you have Amazon Prime.
1,We have the tap and the echo. I wouldn't buy another tap. It's the voice activation that is so good. But if you don't mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok. But for me... only echo.
1,A perfect gift for family members is getting them an Alexa and providing them the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from all the functionality Alexa provides. This was a big hit for our oldest son and his wife and family!
1,This is an amazing piece of hardware. The Amazon Echo is very user friendly and my girlfriend loves how the echo interfaces with her Phillips Hue and simple it is to operate. I am definitely looking at getting another one for my mother for her birthday in the upcoming months.
1,"I have had the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black for about 1 1/2 yrs, I love it. I have found the fire tv to be much better in regards to less buffering than the fire stick. Great product."
1,I purchased 3 of these for Christmas gifts. Our family has several Kindles and they've all been very good tablets! They're great for all ages too.
1,"Very satisfied with this purchase. Fast, big screen and good resolution. Bought it for my son around Xmas and I got a very good deal too! Wish I had bought 2 at that price. ($100)"
1,Got this for my husband for Christmas. He's not all that computer/electronics literate but he had no problems setting it up. We love asking her to tell us jokes! Great sound quality. Loved it so much we bought an Echo Dot too.
1,Perfect for what I want to use it for. Nice size too
1,"bought this for my 8 year old daughter. She loves it and I love that it comes with a great parental controls set up. I can let her have some freedom with apps and internet and be fairly confident that anything inappropriate is blocked. I can also set it up so that I can review her activity later on. Only reason it got 4 stars, not 5 is the battery life. I have a Samsung galaxy tablet also, and it lasts several hours longer than the fire tablet with similar use."
1,in the world of voice assistants the amazon echo does stand out as i love the device
1,"Easy to use,access books,love the apps,clear pict."
1,"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more"
1,"Family is having fun using ECHO. We use it as an alarm, for time, music, weather and getting answers to some of our questions."
1,Fun to play with.. Was alittle difficult to get all set up.
1,"This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!"
1,I use it primarily for movies. The audio is low while using ear buds. Othere wise a very nice tablet for the money.
1,"I love my kindle voyage. It is very little weight and I love the page press that it has, don't even have to move your hand to turn the page. You can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablets you can do that with."
1,Recommended every day. Great Customer service also fast shipping.
1,Does everything my daughter needs to do as far as playing games
1,"This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point."
1,"I got this for my nephew, He loves it I have also got them for my mom and myself. they are fabulous, the price is so low.. you can really do a lot with it."
1,The Amazon fire TV has been a joy to own. It has a very simple to use interface. I also love the fact that it is always ready in the background a simple push of a button and it wakes and it's right where you left off. In my eye it's worth every penny I paid for it.
1,I found the tablet easy to useIt has a longer battery life than most and the memory can be increased with an SD card You can use the Google app if you don't like using Amazon
1,Easy to use...simple set up. I'd recommend it to anyone
1,Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.
1,If you're watching TV and playing games this is for you. Don't waste money on a iPad. This is great for reading too. Bought for a fireman spending long hours at the firehouse.
0,"So sorry I bought this, had to change its wake up name to echo from Alexa it wouldn't answer to Alexa, on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being terrible I'll rate it a 2 most of the time didn't know how to answer or didn't understand the question, did all the self help and with amazon customer service am ready to return it"
1,Alexa keeps you updated on news and weather. Great to answer questions. Fun to use.
1,i love this its is very good to have its different
1,This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
1,My kids love it. Got it for my kids. We use it too.
1,just a litte slow but other then that it was great
1,I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.
1,The teacher really likes this new tablet in their classroom!
1,Love the child profiles for my kids and all the parental controls! Great for price
1,YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
1,"I was hesitant to upgrade from my original firestick to this, but I'm glad I did. It works much faster and smoother. Well worth the money."
1,This tablet had been great. So much better than the old tablet we had.
1,Good. Everything went well. Every thing was good!!!
1,Perfect for somebody who doesn't want to pay for cable or turn their tv into a smart tv
1,enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining
1,Easy to use and set up to get started. Set's up for both of my children
1,"Works well, setup is extremely easy. Replaced my directv subscription and We are very happy with it."
1,It is easy to navigate but I find that the storage is a bit limited. I bought a sd card to upgrade the storage but it just seems to confuse me. I am still learning but I got it for my grandson specifically and he wouldn't use it so now I have a new one that I can take with me anywhere and not get bored.
1,"The new 7"" Kindle Fire is an excellent product for the kids. The compact size makes it easy to travel with and the apps are great. Amazon hit a homerun with this one!"
1,Bought this to use in my basement after I decided to cut the cord. This item works awesome and is exactly what I needed. The main reason I purchased it was to stream PS Vue but there are many other devices that do that now. Not at all disappointed with this item.
1,I love the responsiveness of the Amazon Echo and all the things that I can do.
1,Considered the google product but glad I chose the Echo......very pleased with product.
1,It took less than five minutes to set-up and start using my Kindle. Features are easy to use and it's holds a charge for an incredibly long time!
1,I love it. Use it daily for everything. Love the options and looks.
1,"This is a great tablet. My wife, my 4 year old son, and myself all use this. It is so easy to use, my 4 year old shows me all the tricks. Amazon is even easier to use which we really enjoy. I would not recommend the Nuprocase however that I think we got from amazon."
1,love it...works as expected. would recommend this product.
1,This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle.
1,This is my second one. I love it. The price was great. Bought one for my daughter.
1,This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised.
1,Purchased for using Freetime with three year old. So far so good. The three year old is able to use and enjoys. Did get the amazon case.
1,Bought as gift for mom and she loves it and uses all the time! It was simple to set up also.
1,"I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen's not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can't be beat."
1,"My son and I wanted to find a small tablet to watch videos on and do some basic internet browsing. This tablet fit the bill perfectly. We weren't looking for all the bells and whistles and wanted to find something in our budget. At $49 this little piece of Fire is amazing. The graphics are great, not HD but still great. The speed is acceptable and otherwise it's easy to use. I love the dimensions, it's easy to carry and not heavy. Absolutely Love it!"
1,already toldpeople about fast pickup.the kindle is great as always.
1,"Alexia is very handy for general qiestions, music and most trivia type questions. I am very happy we have this handy tool available to ""hands free"" help for most of our queries."
1,It does what it's supposed to do very minimal freezing second or two on occasion
1,"I love my amazon fire, would recommend to anyone. It is a good buy."
1,"My old Kindle was broken, so I received the Paper white for a Christmas gift. I love it! It is small and light enough to carry anywhere, and I love that I can adjust the back light to accommodate day or dark."
1,"setup and ran this box within 10 minutes, very portable, and works just great"
1,Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.
1,"I have wanted a Kindle reader for a few years now & I'm so happy to finally have one! It's so convenient, easy to hold, & most importantly it's easy on the eyes even when I don't have my glasses!"
1,It's the best tablet i ever. It has the coolest apps
1,"This is the very best devise to read from. The print is one hundred percent book like. The device is light, elegant and a pleasure to use. There is nothing that comes close."
0,Just ask or command the machine does it...getting really lazy now LOL
1,"My wife likes to web-surf in bed and was using a 15"" notebook for years. Found it to be very cumbersome and was looking for an alternative. Tried out this Amazon Fire 7 figuring it would be adequate, but has exceeded expectations. Seems quick with good screen resolution. Only problem is doesn't always respond to finger or stylus swipe which seems common with most of these touch screens."
1,This is a.great product. Glad I cut the cable wire
1,"This tablet is good for basic web browsing and lite app use. Great for kids, or someone who isn't going to be a heavy tablet user. Great introductory tablet."
1,This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great.
1,"I wanted something to access Netflix on my older TV and this is a great easy fast device, but it so much more. I have an Amazon account and can also access my video library and on demand titles. There is also other TV apps and channels available also, if they add a couple more channels I would consider canceling my cable."
1,"I bought this for my wife, she is so happy with it. She spends hours reading her books. So much easier reading with the Paper White."
1,"Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn't as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else."
1,"I am pretty impressed with this Amazon Fire tablet.I've had many iPads over the years, currently have an iPad Air 2, and this Fire tablet is very nice.Great screen, very responsive, lots of options, reliable wifi.I can't believe this thing only costs 50 bucks!This may replace my iPad."
1,Purchased as cheap alternative to an Ipad for my son.
1,"I was not sure about making the jump to an e-reader vs. books, but now I just can't put it down. It is easy on the eyes and I can download new titles instantly. It is great"
1,Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
1,I am not a savvy table user. I actually don't like tablets to start with. I prefer my convertible Windows 10 laptop but there is a Bible app called youversion that is very useful to me and my iPhone screen is too small and my laptop is too big to carry to Church so this tablet is perfect for me. Coupled with a leather case it is easier to hold and enjoyable to use. I got it on sale from Best Buy for $33 + tax. It is a great deal at this incredible price.
1,"This is a great buy for music, news and any kind of information you want."
1,Does the job. Kids are kinda of rough with its holding up well
1,"the only thing this needs is more space. The tablet works great! and adding apps was easy, it just did not have enough space for my endless amount of apps I use. but my granddaughter plays with it all day!"
1,Ran out to buy a tablet quickly and was pleasantly surprised by this one! Great price easy purchase!
1,Had the original Kindle and filled it. Upgraded to the Kindle Voyage and absolutely love it!
1,"The Kindle Fire is nice, sleek, and well functional. I bought this as a Christmas gift, which was a real success. It has all you need; your downloadable books, games, and web access. It immediately updates to the latest version once you install your internet code."
1,We use it for the music mostly and love it. The kids play games and enjoy it
1,Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
1,"Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information."
1,"I have been a kindle fan for years because it does so much more if you have Amazon prime. Free movies, free music, free books, etc. The tablet has a great picture, is fast to search, and lasts for years."
1,Very helpful enjoy asking Alexa questions on history each day
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo for my parents for christmas after they saw it at a friends house a few months ago. My dad, who is not technology savvy in the slightest, loved it! It's so much fun asking Alexa different questions, or using the trivia on her. If you want to play a song you can just tell her. She'll find it or playing something similar if she can't find the exact match. My parents love the Echo. I do too!"
1,"I'm a traditionalist who loves real books and buys mostly hardcovers. As a consequence, I resisted getting a Kindle for a long time. I'll have to admit now that I wish I'd gotten one sooner. A tremendous amount of research must have gone into the way readers interact with real books, because nothing about the Kindle gets in way of actual reading."
1,"Love this box it's fast, great picture and great with blue tooth pairing."
1,Works great and does everything you want from a personal assistant.I would defintly recomend this product to someone who wishes to have a personal assitant.
1,Works beautifully and I enjoy the product. My daughter loves it.
1,"Love being able to read outside in full sun. Adjustable backlight for reading at night, great for the car or in bed."
1,"I spend a lot of time at the lake and love to read. I enjoy being outdoors and sitting on the dock reading. It was always impossible with my phone or iPad, which I still love! This is just amazing, like reading a ""paper book"" without having to hold it ""open""! Love the clarity!!!"
1,"Great for watching movies, videos. Playing games. Shopping on Amazon. It's small enough for travel easy to set up and the price was very affordable."
1,"Great tablet! User friendly.....size good, eAsy setup.."
1,"Not the best tablet, but for the price on black friday I couldn't resist. Great for a couple of teens."
1,"Love how user friendly the Kindle Fire is, for any age.."
1,"I always seen it on tv so went to bestbuy to see a sample. Saw it, tried it out liked so I bought it for a Christmas gift"
1,I have really enjoyed using the Amazon Echo so far. It has a great sound.
1,Loves it. Best thing ever. Works amazing with my Hue Lights.
1,"If all you want to do is read ebooks, then this is the device for you"
1,This is my first kindle and I love it. Would highly recommend
1,I use Alexa daily. The speaker is loud. Also buy the remote it's convenient.
1,It works great. If you have a chance to get one I would recommend it.
1,This was actually a gift for a family member. Maybe one day I'll cave in and buy one to play around with. Otherwise a good little tablet you can carry around in place of books!!
1,Bought one for each of my kids and they love it. Functionally sound product very easy to use.
1,"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
1,"My old Kindle was 4 years old, this one is so much easier to use. I like the new features. I definitely will recommend it to my friends and family."
1,Perfect tablet for my son. No complaints. Super fast shipping!
1,We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.
1,I do not have any complaints regarding this product.
1,use everyday around the house and outside and travel
1,I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it
1,So easy to read books from and play my different games that I enjoy. The set up was really easy did take a little while to get it going but probably more my fault than otherwise.
0,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
1,My son just love playing games on this tablet. Its easy and fun!
1,"Very good deal when I bought it, even better pricing than from Amazon itself"
0,It's a good starter tablet. I haven't been overly impressed but it does what it needs to do.
1,"This has allowed me to cut that nasty cable cord, which is nice to the check book."
1,I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
1,"I recommend this product to all!Easy to use.Lots of shows, movies and apps to watch. Great buy for all ages."
1,"Good job Amazon great product easy to hook up and start watching movies, sports etc."
1,Ive cut the cable cord thanks to the firestick! !!
1,This is not going to compare to a galaxy tab or iPad but it's a good starter tablet for my nephew. I hate the ads that pop up on the screen and wish Amazon would have mentioned that.
1,Plays loud good base and awesome item would recommend
1,"This tablet was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is technologically challenged and was able to set it up and use it with ease. Great multiuse tablet. The size is ok. Get the 8"" if you are like me and like a little more screamReal estate."
1,"I bought 2 for my kids for XMAS, the purple and tangerine. The colors were great! The tablets are really nice and they enjoy them. Great camera. The only complaint is some of the games in the play store charge. The same games were free in the google play store."
1,"I really like the voice control. It takes all the effort out of doing searches, without the annoying on screen keyboards."
0,I was excited about the Amazon echo. However after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast. The echo couldn't answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which I never asked for.Unless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isn't a good speaker.I did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer. Even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain. Some said maybe I got a defective unit which wasn't the case the echo is just limited in what it can do.I would say save your money this isn't worth it yet.
1,We officially cut the cord and decided to use this as well as an antenna for local TV...The screen resolution is great. Navigation speed is quick without delay. We use Playstation Vue and it works seamlessly with the Fire TV...
1,"if you have a fire stick and use it everyday, I recommend upgrading. Actually being connected to my modem is so much faster than using the wifi signal. Less buffering with faster loads. No complaints."
1,Great for the person who loves technology and the sound of their own voice command. Price is right too.
1,"Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance."
1,This makes reading really easy! Great gift for the book reader in your life.
1,"The Amazon fire TV is a nice upgrade from the Firestick (although I think the firestick is great for most applications). With the box, you get the added bonus of 4K and hard wired Ethernet connection."
1,bought one for myself & then one for our 8 yr.old granddaughter who is teaching me how to use it
1,"Now I don't have to feel guilty bringing my Kindle to work,he can play his games and watch his videos."
1,It does the job.
1,Got the echo as a birthday present and use it everyday. Kids love playing games with it as well
1,"It's not the fastest tablet, but it's fine for what I use it for. Camera is not that great."
1,Great for reading! Bought it to read while traveling!
1,Daughter uses at college. She has a need for books to be read to her and this Kindle does this. It is GREAT!
1,"Makes Dumb TV Smart, very small package. Slides under flat screen TV, remote works everywhere, no lost signal. Fire works better wireless...weird...Voice control is a nice feature, but the remote gets me there faster."
1,"I own a first generation Kindle Fire, as well as a second generation. I purchased these for my two grandchildren and one for a student in my classroom. These are much better than my Kindle Fires. Good cameras that are not on the original, and they have much better picture quality. The ads are not obtrusive. Definitely recommend this product."
1,Great for reading. Good starter device. Would recommend to someone else
1,An awesome product. Getting my money's worth. I would truly recommend this product.
1,easy to operate and very handy and good for the price.
1,This works almost seamlessly! Very little buffer and runs all apps well.
1,"I love my new tablet! So easy to navigate and set up. Have used a little so far, and have no issues with any of the apps/ installed programs. Lots of things to do."
1,It really is helpful to have this tablet around. It's really good for its price but the camera isn't so good but it still is a great deal.
1,It was easy and simple to use. Fast and responsive.
1,I love Alexa! She keeps me informed on the weather.r.
1,"Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Works great. She's dropped it several times and it just keeps on working! No issues at all."
1,Great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go. Love that this stream and plays Prime music. Battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best.
1,Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
1,Really enjoying using my Amazon Fire very easy to use so many different features and apps the graphics and the color on this tablet are so vivid and alive I bought this tablet on sale not really knowing nothing about Amazon Fire but I'm glad that I did!!!
1,Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
1,bought for my grandson easy to use for him . durable enough for a four year old
1,I really like this product. The kids can play all their games on it (even Minecraft) and they are really enjoying them. The one drawback was that it was hard to get them set up for each person with the parental controls. You really had to fiddle with it to figure that part out.
1,upgraded from a previous model and cannot be happier
1,Loving my Echo - Learning to do more things with it every day.
1,The Amazon Kindle is very good for kids and adults. I recommend this tablet to every one and it's very affordable.
1,I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
1,Bought product for my 9yr old son. He loves watching videos and playing games on it.
1,"I've had my eye on the Echo for a few months now. I didn't realize Best Buy had got them in stock until I was discussing with the sales person. I decided to give it a try. Set up was so easy. The voice recognition has been excellent. Alexa hears and appropriately responds to all of my requests, as well as my husband's. It really comes in handy in the mornings, as I can request news and entertainment while getting ready for the day. I can review my daily schedule, adjust it, make lists and so much more. Integration with IFTTT works great. The amount of easily available content is wonderful. While I don't have any smart devices such as lights or thermostats yet, I am planning for them, and will be able to use the Echo to control them."
1,"Great for kids of all ages, purchased two tablets and they love them.."
1,"Used a promotion to buy this from Bestbuy, little did I know that it would be the hottest gift this Christmas season. It was out of stock from amazon for nearly a month. Very easy to set up and the sound is very clear and quite loud for its size. Lots of things you can control and the list is growing."
1,"The back light is a great addition to this kindle, along with the page press! It's perfect for only using one hand to read. I would highly recommend this kindle and is worth the extra money."
1,I use this device for streaming live tv with no issues.
1,Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
1,"Everything is good, but no youtube good amount of apps"
1,"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Installed a 64 gb micro SD and install as many apps to the card as possible to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 5 year old granddaughter."
1,My mother loves the Kendal it was one that was rep
1,"I liked the Fire TV so much, I purchased a second one."
1,This was a Christmas present to our 4 year old grandson and he loves it. He was so excited when he opened it on Christmas! It is a perfect tablet for a 4 year old!
1,"This is one of the most amazing products. We have several of these throughout our house - Kitchen, Living room, our master bathroom, bedrooms, etc. We use it all the time to play music from XM, Pandora, Amazon music, etc. We play specific songs on demand. We get news and sports updates. We get info from Wikipedia! We play games - Jeopardy! We order Pizza from Dominoes! Check my commute time! Make a grocery list a To-do list! Use it as a timer! Use it as an intercom in the house with other Echos. How did we ever live without it! I highly recommend! The voice recognition is great! Way better than Apple Siri! You should buy one - you'll love it!"
1,Love this little tablet. My 5 year old will leave my iPad alone now!! Apps work great and sound is awesome!!
1,Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
1,This is my third kindle. Work offshore and read a lot. Unable to carry books with me so the kindle is perfect.
1,"Compact, long battery, able to read in any light level."
1,"Alexa is awesome! With practice, she will keep you on the couch asking her to do all the work. She is easy to setup , understands sentences and really love how she can find any song you want using Amazon Music."
1,Nice inexpensive tablet for my grandson to learn on and play games.
1,"Good, but not overall as capable or comprehensive as I was hoping. Will continue to explore capabilities and Apps."
1,Yes most people have iPhones and tablets to read on but I find it easier to focus and the new paperwhite screen is crystal clear in any light.
1,I will save enough on reduced cable bills in two months to pay for my Amazon Fire TV
1,Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
1,"Works great, has a great display, easy to use. Rivals other more expensive brands."
1,"I love the color is choose,and the tablet is great"
1,Absolutely love this product and it will be a great Christmas gift for my daughter who is a dance teacher!
1,I purchased a Samsung S7 and S7 Edge and they are even better than the previous phones I have owned.
1,I love this table for my 4 year old. Ttje parental controls are Awesome! I also like that it changes up the games for her so she won't get board!
1,"I love this product , so nice to have for trips!!!"
1,This is my 3rd kindle but only because I've lost the previous ones. Can't imagine reading any other way.
1,Very nice does almost everything I wanted it to do. Wish it's voice recognition was a little better.
1,"Good tablet for the price. Has all features needed. Typing was difficult, but using a stylus fixed those issues. Has enough technology built into it that it won't be obsolete in a few months like some of the off brand stuff."
1,"Picked one of these Fire tablets up today for the crazy price of $39.99. I didn't really need it, but the extra $10. of was just too tempting. Charged it up, connected to WiFi and all was good to go. Played around with it for a couple of hours and it worked perfectly. Video and sound were good, speed was nice, and I am really impressed with the price. My wife's Kindle paperwhite case cost as much as this full feature tablet. Time will tell about longevity, but first impression is, this is a great little tablet.."
1,"The box does exactly what it saids it will do. No lag, great quality, very happy!!!"
1,My only wish is that you could sync a Bluetooth Speaker to take the music playing on the Echo unit to another room.
1,this is a great little Toyota to have. the speaker sounds great
1,"I brought the particular item for my mother in law who is in her late 70s.This tablet is perfect her to play games, in large view and communicate with the grand kids."
1,My nephew love it. He uses it every day thank you.
1,nice for this price................................
1,Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
1,Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
1,"this was a present for my fifteen year old grandson,it was new as described, fast shipping, and he is happy with it."
1,"Can't say anything bad about it. Great price and a great deal. Does everything that my grandfather needs such as reading, internet and fun games to pass time."
1,"Very easy to set up.Easy to navigate, clear picture!"
0,"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
1,love this and the prospect of using it with other integrated products like nest.
0,I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
1,"I bought this to sideload Kodi on to it. A very wise choice, indeed! I no longer have to lug my computer out to my TV and attach via HDMI. It's ALWAYS on with AFTV! I haven't really used it for anything but Kodi and Netflix, but LOVE IT! Run out and buy this , NOW!"
1,"I'm a techie. I love cool products.The Echo is a wonderful addition to the home automation revolution.Besides the home automation benefits, the sound quality is superb for the size. I love being able to play music, change the volume, and get updates all via voice. I would like to see some additional updates to how you can interact (without having to say Amazon or Alexa to trigger).Recommend it highly!!!"
1,Love my new device! Great value for the money. Worth it.
1,This was a great price for a great tablet on Black Friday
1,"Christmas present for the kids, its strong and durable and constantly used. inexpensive as is unless you want to get the kid proof case.Apps, games, web browsing and video/photo functions are good. Do think how this item will be used as most likely its internal storage at 16gb will fill up quickly"
1,"No home automation yet but will add some soon. Great for music, speaker sound is really good and works great for us. Haven't used Alexa to buy directly but see that will probably happen. Very pleased with the purchase"
1,It's very entertaining and provides instant information.
1,I love Alexa! I'm very busy Person so i like the fact she will turn on my favorite radio station tell me brief news and order my favorite Pizza from Dominos and play trivia games. There's room for improvement but I got it on sale sonfor the money paid I'm happy with it.
1,I already had a kindle paperwhite but wanted to upgrade a bit
1,"I love the Paperwhite and we have had Kindles in the house for years. This Paperwhite is as snappy as the Voyage and while it doesn't have that smooth glass screen, it also doesn't have the extra $100 or so price tag. It's a great piece of tech that often goes on sale. Get it when it does. It's well worth it."
1,It serves the purpose and kid is happy with it. It can be used for kindle reading too.
1,The selling point for the purchase of this Kindle was the ability to read in low light situations.
1,The Amazon Echo is a great device. I find it particularly useful for home automation.
1,"Made life so much easy... reads news, weather, time, shopping list, to do list.. without us having to look at phones... awesome product"
1,Great for Netflix and YouTube videos for the kids. Durable and easy to tote around. Great product!
1,"I didn't expect it to be so little, however I ordered it online and I should have read the description on the screen size. Other than that, it has been really great reading and playing with it."
1,I bought this for my son to read books on and mybe play a few games. So far so good. No complaints.
1,"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
0,Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.
1,We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
1,A great alternative to cable/satellite. Not as expensive as Apple TV but just as much content. Got it on sale at a great price.
1,Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games
1,"This is a great product! I was a little skeptical in the beginning of how much it could actually do and assist, but after playing with this for a couple of hours I realized it was an amazing product. The sound is very comparable to one of the top leading Brand speakers!"
1,It is very easy to use and very durable.. I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a tablet.
1,This is the best child's tablet and some adults like me can benefit from the warranty and matched case
1,"It is very easy to set up and helps in delivering a better streaming experience. It was so good, I bought a second one."
1,So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it
1,"everything you need, good price, easy to use and kid friendly"
1,Good tablet and great buy. Compact size allows you to use one hand and use anywhere.
1,Great product..i would recommend.. have no complaints
1,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile."
1,Very happy with purchase. Would recommend to family and friends.
1,Got as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day . Really great
1,Good built-in speakers but would love the capability of connecting to a Bluetooth speaker like the dot.
1,I love this product it is so easy to use It has a clear picture
0,Tried setting this up on 2 TV's using both WIFI and Ethernet for hours. Could never get a signal. A total waste of time.
1,"Bought two for early teenagers-they want books, games and it helps to teach responsibility of e-mail and social media use."
1,"Bought this for my uncle who is visually handicapped. He loves it! Weather at several locations, time, singer/ group verifications, connects to his iPhone Sirius XM station & so much more. Bought one for me!!!"
1,"Echo connects to the Alexa Voice Service to control smart home devices, play music, provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and more-instantly. When it is playing any music, it cannot hear us properly and it is not quite movable, I mean it needs power all the time."
1,"We got this as a gift for a child. For a first tablet, it's great! Even for an adult it would work wonderfully."
1,I love my new Echo - I can play music for myself and for my grandkids as well as my wife and we all love it - we all can ask questions and get answers instantly
1,Good for everyday use. But it better fits people who are a bit experienced
1,I am very happy with the performance of the product.
1,Great Tablet. We wanted Orange which took a little while to get shipped but came in couple weeks.
1,As far as e-readers go this has to be the best experience I've had with one. Simplistic and ergonomic design allows you to fly through books.
1,"I love my Kindle. I have dozens and dozens of books in the palm of my hand. The Paperwite screen is just like looking at a page on paper. No eye strain. Now, they just need to get the Paperwhite with color.By the way, when I received my device from the store, it was set up for the Russian language. But, I was able to fumble through the menus and change it to English."
1,I have bought this item because I was previously using the firestick and I was happy with those but the streaming would buffer a bit more than I'd like. So a friend of mine recommend it to me sand said little to almost no buffering. And it's exactly that little to no buffering. Even when streaming from my iPhone it's an amazing device. I really like it
1,"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family."
1,"I previously purchased this item for my son and daughter as Christmas presents. They both enjoyed it so much and indicated they used it primarily to play music and ask questions. They have also used it to utilize the Alexa skills i.e. playing games, use as a timer etc.. I purchased this item in anticipation of the impending integration with the Sonos speaker system which I have installed throughout the house. I am very excited to learn that the integration is coming soon and will provide another review once I have had an opportunity to operate my Sonos speaker via voice command."
1,We purchased this tablet for my Grandfather and it works great for his use cases:Light web browsingNetflixEmail
1,"The kids just absolutely love this, they get to ask her questions or listen to jokes. I love to listen to the music when doing house work or even working outside. It is nice that you can turn the music up or down through Alexa instead of going to the device and turning it up or down."
1,They have come a long way since I purchased the first kindle Fire. It's a worthy successor and a very good tablet for the budget conscience person.
1,Absolutely great would buy over and over again excellent for streaming
1,Amazing device. I got it for 35 bucks on Black Friday. Plays all games the kids want. Snappy and fast. Great for kids and adults. Love the Amazon kindle.
1,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug."
1,Bought this for a grandchild. Perfect gift. Recommend this.
1,I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!
1,First time using Amazon Fire programming. So far my child and I love the apps and programs. I really love the parental limits and time limits I can set. And that I can set learning and reading limits before play.
1,Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
1,"This Kindle Fire will replace my 1st generation Fire which was awful except for reading books. The new one lets me do almost anything I wanted: surf the web, read and reply to emails, read e-books, play games, etc. So much better than the old one."
1,We enjoy this device because it allows out tv to have smart tv features.
1,Great gift for a parent to have in their home! Great sound when playing music.
1,I have another brand media player and amazon fire seems more friendly
1,We love our Amazon Fire TV! We get all our favorite shows and movies. It works perfectly!
1,"Just starting to integrate it with other smart home products, but it is already really useful."
1,This thing lets you watch practically anything you want to. Well worth the money
1,My son and i use the tablet everyday 2 times morning and night and theres so much to do on it.
1,Good for the price. Amazon apps aren't much. The big thing Amazon doesn't let you use Google Play for apps.
0,"It all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. It is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3D game. But if u are on tight budget it is useful. ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores). And other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there."
1,My Kindle works great and it just what I was looking for.
1,"This is my second Amazon Echo that I'm adding to another level of our house and I couldn't be happier with these devices. From controlling music, lights, thermostats and the list goes on and on, life with Alexa and an Amazon Echo is much better!"
1,This is a great tablet for the price. The screen is pixelated but it's responsive and the touch screen works fine. Would buy again
1,This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that's easy on the eyes.
1,Alexa is very good a quickly satisfying your music requests. The whole interface is novel and interesting to use and for guests who have not encountered Alexa previously. Sound quality is good but not top shelf. I purchased one for our son and son-in-law for Fathers Day. Finally about 3 weeks ago we bought one for ourselves. Net: worth purchasing.
0,I I‚Äôve used this for a month now. It works great 75 percent of the time. Alexa doesn‚Äôt always understand you. The mic doesn‚Äôt hear you when your 20 feet away.
1,I would have gave it a five star rating but it will change pages to easily. You will either go forward or backwards by just toughing the screen.
1,Got this as a birthday gift. Fun for the whole family!!!
1,It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.
1,Easier than reading a book. I don't know why I didn't buy one years ago.
1,I purchased the FireTV to integrate into my Control4 system as a media streaming device. It has worked flawlessly in the mode. I'm still getting used to the controls but they seem pretty straight forward.
1,i got this kindle for xmas. simply lovely. i would strongly recommend you to get one
1,"Bought this for my 9 year old as a Christmas present last year. He has put this tablet thru the ringer! And even though the screen is cracked, it still works perfectly! He loves it."
1,"I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
1,I bought this because I wanted to play games on a little bigger screen. I didn't want a large and expensive tablet. This was the perfect price and size for me.
1,"Much faster and stronger signal than Fire Stick, which I also love and is on my other TV."
1,Great small tablet that has everything you need! Small but convenient. I love that I could add more memory to it with an SD card so now I have everything in there & I can get plenty of apps. Use it a lot for reading online and even for watching movies when I'm away. Love it!
1,when I bought the tablet I was not sure if she could advance on but she has done very well thanks
1,"Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is not a tech person, I was afraid he would be intimidated but he loves it."
0,"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
1,A great gift for someone in college because the digital books are so much cheaper then paper back.
1,Very nice item to have. Keeps me updated on a number of things. Also gives me a daily reminder when to take my medication. Keeps track of my appointments. Very good for general knowledge questions.
1,Alexa is amazing it absolutely just works for anything that I ask easy to set up she's so easy to talk to I haven't had any complications at all I would definitely recommend this to family and friends it's absolutely perfect it was a Christmas gift and I love it
1,The kindle fire is a nice little tablet its great for reading and watching netflix
1,"This product is really good.. this product does everything it says.... you can watch hull,Netflix,penthouse,hustlers, Showtime,HBO,you tube the streaming is unlimited."
1,This tablet is really good for reading and may be used for some browsing. this is overall good deal for the price
1,"It is my first e-reader then I cannot compare it with others. However, in comparison to tablets, the most importance thing is you enjoy reading your book without any eyestrain."
1,Love this tablet daughter uses it mainly and she really likes it good for reading and games as well as web surfing meets all needs !
0,"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
0,"Works ok, doesn't shutdown properly. Notified Amazon tried to fix over the phone. They wanted to replace it but I said I would put up with a ""hard"" shutdown"
0,"Good tablet for the price. Was looking for a substitute for the Amazon Fire HD 7 that my son lost, and this is a pretty good replacement. Not that much of a difference."
1,I definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.
1,I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
1,Excellent product for the price. Would recommend to anyone.
1,This is a great tablet for its price and it has many uses
1,"Had put this off thinking my iPad would suffice but it was hard on my eyes. The Paperwhite is easy to download, much lighter to hold while reading, compact enough to carry in my purse when I have some downtime for reading, and emits a much kinder light for reading at night. Just what this book lover needed!"
1,"For the price, can't beat the quality of this product. I use it in conjunction with my Prime account to watch online and download movies to watch off line. Also like that it has a memory card slot for expansion."
1,This was a great buy. I would recommend to everyone who likes to have tv options!
1,"This is a great tablet that is simple. I actually have bought 3 for my children, so far. They are simple to use and just enough storage for the apps they like. So far no issues!"
1,"Love that you can pick different colors for the tablet, my mom will love it. Great easy functionality and ability to delete apps and install new ones."
1,"Easy to use, simple interface and the right size for quick and easy web surfing and movie watching"
1,"Purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update (lost wifi connection during the download, bricking the kindle). This model has 300dpi, up from 220 on the previous model. With text it is barely, if at all, noticeable. With any kind of graphics or cover images, the increase in resolution is nicer. Unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation. The voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasn't worth it to me. And the uneven bottom lighting isn't bad, but it is there and I would have thought Amazon would have fixed that by now. Maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager. Still, the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice eReader. Noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change, easier on the eyes. Like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts. Overall, highly recommended. Best eReader for the price."
1,great bluetooth speakerworks well with harmony hubworks well with smart appliances and ifttt
1,We got this for my son to use as a reader and also do audio books with read along. It has been great. He had a laptop but that is too large to be practical. This works perfectly for him.
1,Works
1,"great way to read & manage books... pros: non-distracting (can't do anything but reading :-) that's BIG plus), non eye straining , great battery life.."
1,love it... the amazon fire tv is perfect for our trailer while traveling....
1,"This tablet is your best deal for the money. Since it uses an adaptation of Andriod made by Amazon, it is technically possible to install Google Play app store without routing the device, if you read a bit online, making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight. Absolutely recommended."
1,Great deal. The downfall to this device is that you have to pay an extra $15 to get the ads removed from your lock screen.
1,Works great! We love it! I would recommend fire TV to anyone.
1,"Satisfied with tablet, especially for the price. Christmas gift for a middle school kid. It worked out."
1,This is my third fire TV. I have the original Fire TV model as well as the Fire TV stick. I also have multiple Rokus various models. I think this latest Fire TV is my favorite. I love the interface as well as the speed. I just wish Time Warner Cable would approve it for their App so I could use it to stream my cable TV channels like I can with my Roku.
1,"We bought two Kindle Paperwhites and we just love them! I love the size and portability of them. One of them was for our kids so that when we travel we don't have to bring a bunch of books in the car, it's all on one little device and frees up so much space in the car!"
1,It Is A Great Product To Have & And Answer........
1,"I purchased two of these tablets, one for my niece, one for my nephew, as they are often fighting over the tablet. It is a great platform, with awesome apps, and comes equipped with a very sturdy and rugged case. Five stars. Worth every penny."
1,My first kindle and would buy another one. It does what I expected it to and more.
0,Even after reading the reviews about it being slow I decided to go head any purchase it. Didn't thick it was going to be this slow
1,Bought it for my wife. Handy to read while exercising.
0,"If you aren't tech savvy, know someone who is to be able to get Alexa to respond. Amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support; I'm afraid the first question will be, ""Is it plugged in?"" I'm not tech savvy, but I also have some sense."
1,Overall am very happy with the purchase. Both Quality and price made this hard to resist.
1,Alexa is a great help in finding answers to questions. She also plays music that I want. You always keep leaning how she can help you.
1,"My kids break stuff, not on purpose, but they break electronics. Rather than spend hundreds on other tablets(that might get broken), this kindle at this price was a no brainer. No bugs, simple menus, easy to use for kids 6+."
1,I upgraded from a kindle HDX 7 to this HD 10. I am pleased with it so far. The HDX will be hard to replace. I had it for 4 years and loved it. The 10 is a little bit slower but I have more time than money. The cameras and WiFi have been upgraded. Overall pleased with my purchase.
1,"I purchased after owning a FireStick for a while, which is now moved to a different room. Works great so far and runs smoother than the stick."
1,its a very good product that I am glad I bought for reading
1,This is one of the best products that someone has come with. I love it
1,"Alexa is a wonderful companion and will never fail to impress your friends. Want to know the weather in Texarkana or Timbuktu? No problem... just ask her. Or how far is it from here to Istanbul or Indianapolis? No sweat. Wanna hear some music? Just ask her to play The Eagles or Jackson Brown, Iron Maiden or Frank Sinatra. It's easy. And that's just scratching the surface."
1,This was definitely an upgrade for my 1st grader. More memory = more fun
1,"The sound is good, and it gets really loud. New features are always added, and it is compatible with a growing list of products. *The less awesome part: I've found that if I go to max volume, Alexa can't hear me even if I scream right next to her."
1,"Very good quality product. I bout as a gift for a friend, she loved it"
1,"My parents (in their 60's) were the ones that turned us on to Echo and Alexa - yeah, I know! We really love it and are just scraping the surface of its capabilities."
1,These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts!
1,Bought this to update the old one we have and so far it's been a good buy.
1,The Amazon Echo is an amazing piece of technology. The things it can do are endless and new things are added weekly. Just amazing
1,I was worried at first but it works great and only con is that u have to unplug it from the tv it does get super hot
1,"The Amazon Echo is a fast-responding, voice-activated interface. It is a great personal assistant for some of the basics at home like managing a calendar, shopping lists, and trivia."
1,I've had kindles since they first came out love it
1,Great for using with smart devices. I now have 3 of them.
1,Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.
1,"I had an I pad and replaced it with a MACAIR. However it is heavy and when i travel, I don;t feel like logging it along! So for $49, I thought ""HOW CAN I LOSE""? SO I bought it and I love it! The only thing I dislike are the ads that keep popping up for me to buy stuff. I am not sure it can be turned off. Other than that- NO COMPLAINTS!"
1,"The Amazon Kindle Voyage is the absolute e-reader to end all e-readers. Light, amazing screen, and stylish, minimal design. If you want an e-reader, definitely buy this one!"
1,I was a little worried at first because I brought the tablet for my 7 year old but so far I have no complaints
1,Changed the print size to huge - which it is not!!!. Would appreciate the larger print size for reading books
1,I had the firestick but decided to get the box based on reviews and am happy i did because the box is much faster and better overall.
1,I would highly recommend this item. Great home speaker. Plays anything you ask. Also gives you weather info and about anything else you want to know!
1,"Replaced an older Kindle that was stepped on, and love the new Kindle the lighted screen is perfect for night reading, and the screen never washes out in bright sun light."
1,this is the perfect table to download books from Amazon....
1,Really cool and the speaker is great for any room!
1,We recently purchased this exact tablet for our daughter who is 2 years old and decided to purchase this tablet for a charitable gift at Christmas. I would recommend this rather than more expensive tablet options for a child. it is worth the money and very user friendly.
1,"Black Friday deal for $35. regularly $49. worth it at $49 too. not a replacement for a laptop, but good battery life, and perfect for surfing the net, e mail, amazon content etc bought a cover for it on amazon."
1,"love the battery life, the ability to read in sunlight"
1,Purchased this as a christmas gift for my mom who isn't to tech davy. She loved it and says its easy to navigate.
1,My husband is up in years & really enjoys spending time on his Kindle. He had a smaller one & it gave out on him so this one is ideal. He spends hours on it & has hours of fun!!!
0,The sound coming from the echo is amazing considering it's small size.
1,Very easy to use. I have downloaded three books and I am enjoying reading them.
1,This will be great for my parents who are older because it easy to use.
1,"this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera"
1,The other kids got the kids fire but this is comparable.
1,Amazing tablet for the price i love it is really easy to use and light weight awesome speed
1,"Purchased for my father, 84 years old! Easy to use!"
1,Bought for adopted family for Christmas they were happy
1,"The size is nice for portability, roughly the size of a normal paperback, nice features, very easy to use, adding books to it is a very easy procedure, either downloading or hooking it up to the computer to transfer .pdfs, etc."
0,"I purchased this tablet on a discounted price as an alternative for RC tablet. The operating system is not good, very slow response, apps takes a lot of time to open. Many of the apps like youtube is not made for fire OS, so my little one has a difficult time handling it. After 2 months, I got him RC tablet."
0,"Can't expect too much at $33.33, out of the box it has pixel damage. Already have it set up too much of hassle to return or exchange now."
1,pretty much everything. very easy to use. like it a lot.
1,Great product at a great price! So glad I bought this!
1,This is a great addition to my OTA TV programming. It's the best thing since I left cable TV for broadcast TV!
1,"I was looking to purchase the Fire TV stick or the Fire TV. I got the FIre TV on Black Friday. My friend purchased the Fire TV stick and I was impressed with the capabilities it provided. When I saw the Fire TV on sale, I decided to give it a try and I was really impressed with the speed with just going through the menu and the apps. I would definitely recommend this product who is looking for a media player. There is a lot of app options to get."
1,"Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this tablet will appeal to you! Easy to understand tutorials, smooth animations, and more user friendly than Android or Apple products (and yes I own some of Samsung's and Apple's latest mobile devices) $49 is an amazing price! Best worth per dollar spent!"
1,Love the kindle fire and can do just about anything with free apps!
1,"Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go!"
1,This was my first kindle. I did do some research and read many reviews on this one. I have been very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend the paperwhite to anyone looking for a reader.
1,"I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet."
1,"Like it a lot. A little difficult to learn how to ask for some things. Takes time to get to know correct phrases. Sound is OK, not a boom box."
1,I have no problems with it. Maybe a lil to small and to heavy
1,I bought this same tablet for my children two years ago who were eleven and eight years of age. They enjoyed it so much that I bought one for my eight year old Godson.
1,This tablet was a gift for my nephews and nieces to share (ages 4-8). Their eyes lit up as soon as they tore off the paper and saw the bright orange package. It was easy to set up and they were quickly downloading and installing their favorite games from the Amazon App Store. Screen quality appears to be very good and processing speed is very quick! Our only regret is that we didn't buy the 3-pack so that they each could have their own instead of sharing! Great performance value and much appreciated gift!
1,Fern Michaels book Hideaway was not sent to my reader.
1,"old one broke after 9 years, new paper white is great, can read in low light, etc."
1,"It's so much fun to use, and helpful. Plays music, reports weather/traffic, even reads Wikipedia articles. Great item."
0,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
1,Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
1,love it. Bought it as gift for my nephew. Very convenient
1,The echo is fun and practical. Alexia is a joy to talk to and ask questions. The speaker in the unit has great sound quality. The possibilities are limitless.
1,Very easy to set up and begin using. Live fire stuck and fire stick tv
1,Love this product. Much better then the Google brand
1,"I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it, so i love it."
1,A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
1,its really good and product and quality...user friendly to kids
1,I got this tablet for my cousin and she loved it.. My kids already had one so i knew she love it.. they are great for kids all ages my youngest got hers when she was 4 and she is 7 now and its still going lol.. she has dropped it and everything they are great tablets I have nothing bad to say about them..
1,"For the price, nothing beats this. It's not a great tablet but if you only need to surf the web, email and have a decent chat, then this tablet works."
1,Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can't bet this tablet for any price!
1,I am very happy with the echo. We use it and listen to it daily
1,Does the job I expected for the price I paid. Good stuff.
1,Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use
1,Great little tablet . Kids love it !! Does everything that I expected it to do!!
1,"I had the Fire Stick, ran OK did what I need to do but was slow, then I got this and it runs like a champ. plus a big factor why I wanted this was to Ethernet Port."
1,Can't really tell you much as I gave it as a gift but it has been well received.
1,**Purchased the Amazon - Fire - 7' Tablet because it was available for $10 off the regular price.....I needed a tablet that was inexpensive and reliable and found the Amazon Tablet to be a great option....
0,"This is the possibly the best Tablet if you are an Amazon store/prime centric user. But, it doesn't include the Google Play Store and doesn't include most / any of the Google apps, which are stables in the Tablet world. No Google Inbox, etc. For me, this tablet is a ""skip"". But, it's cheap and if it meets your needs you might love it."
1,In my honest opinion spend the extra money on the FireTV and directly connect it to your router. If you have Brighthouse internet then you'll understand why. Their hardware constantly has wifi issues. So much happier that this plugs directly into the router and my streaming is no longer interrupted.
1,This is a great little tablet. I haven't used my computer in weeks because the little tablet is so handy. Can't believe it took me so long to get one. Also bought my son and grandson one.
1,My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
1,"This was a gift for my wife, she had a previous version, and she loved the upgrade to tjis new version."
1,This is a very good tablet which has power CPU and lots of features. I glad I purchased it.
1,"This kindle is perfect to have nearby at all times. It's simplicity keeps the reader engaged in just the reading material, without any other distractions. The lighting is perfect- does not irritate my eyes."
1,"You cant go wrong with this tablet. I use this for media consumption but mainly for my 8month old baby to bring around and play nursery rhymes. Had a 4gb micro sd laying around, filled it with videos and downloaded a video player app. No more worrying about losing an ipad or my phone tied up with playing his videos. Get the 16$ 2 yr warranty from amazon too. Theyll replace tablet 3 times within 2 yrs no questions ask."
1,"I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it! The paperwhite version makes the screen look like you are reading an actual book. Also,there are a lot of ebook deals daily and she definitely loves that aspect of having a kindle too."
0,"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????"
1,I love my Fire TV and has allowed me to cut all chords with any TV service providers.
1,I love this product. Great sound quality and at a good price
1,my 91 year Mom is reachable through the Echo - and she can just call to Alexa to contact me - super assistive device for the elderly!
1,The product fully exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend
1,"the Kindle paperwhite is an amazing reader. the battery last for what seems like forever and the clarity of the screen is perfect. The product is also very thin and light, making it easy to take wherever."
1,Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids
1,"great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products."
0,I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.
1,Works well and easily portable. Worth the money...
1,"the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
1,"We purchased 2 of these for a couple of reasons. One because we were already Amazon Prime members and the other was paying too much for cable TV. Weve had them now for approx a month (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) and they work flawlessly. Easy set up (again if you're a Prime Member, just follow the on screen directions. We also subscribed to Sling TV for those channels we still wanted and purchased an outdoor antenna for locals. Fire TV has all the apps ready so they make it easy to set up what you want to watch. It can take a little getting used to apps instead of the TV guide on cable but if you have a smart phone its very similar. The Fire TV will not work with a standard IR remote so you have to use their remote provided but if you want to use only one remote for everything then I highly recommend the Logitech hub system that will control everything including the Fire TV. I have a TV, Blue Ray, Fire TV all connected through HDMI in my receiver and only have to use the one Logitech remote. Make sure you get the hub system since it works with IR, RF and blue tooth. Once everything is set up the Logitech hub app lets you control your system through your smart phone so there's no need to purchase more remotes. By the way, im not an employee of Best Buy, Logitech or Amazon just an electronics freak, but like things simple. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and won't go back to cable TV. One last thing, you still need a broadband connection, faster the better and a good wifi router to set this all up."
0,Its ok tablet but you dont have access to all the same apps that are in google play store. Also to really enjoy the tablet you should be memebr of amazon prime which I am not.
1,But even better with Kodi! Love the 4K! The remote could be better
1,"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
1,Amazon kindle fire tablet looks sleek just like a galaxy tablet. It functions well for its price.
1,Very good product. Wish it did more but hoping it's an evolving thing.
1,a $50 dollar tablet that will do more than an ipad...how can you go wrong!!!
1,"The Kindle fire tablet I purchased, is great for what I use it for, comparing prices&stores research, reading .perfect.best bang for your buck."
1,"I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!"
1,My patents loved this gift and can't get enough...
1,"if you need a media player and access to Amazon Prime Video, this is the perfect device. Interface is smooth and efficient. I have one for each TV in my house."
1,I bought the white and black version as well as the dot and all products are great. They work in each room with wonderful sound and get smarter everyday with new skills.
1,"Just like reading a book except you can highlight and read in the dark, so great."
1,"We have Amazon Prime, so I wanted to replace my older Apple TV, so I could stream directly to the TV. Very happy with purchase. Alexa works well, which is an upgrade over just the Fire Stick."
1,Got a present for sister who's not very technically inclined. Setup was a breeze and she was surprised/scared at what it could do right out of the box!
1,Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use.
1,Got this for my hisband who is totally not tech savvy---he has been able to download some games for himself plus navigate a little bit on here---a major step for him.
1,The tablet is very user friendly for my mom who is not very computer savvy.
1,Very fun for the whole family! We have recommended this to our friends.
1,The kindle is easy on the eyes to read. The light doesn't make the screen look like a computer screen which I was worried about. Simple and easy to use.
1,There is I could say about this tab but nothing other reviewers haven't said. This tab is AWESOME!!!
1,I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
1,Love the battery life & it's light to hold. Love!!
1,"Gave this as a gift, the recipient loves it and uses it daily."
1,My kids and I decided to get this for my wife for mother's day. She absolutely loves it.
1,I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It is a very functional and easy to use.
1,"I've researched this tablet and the ""techies"" say it's a great tablet for the money. I bought it as a gift for my mother and I think it will be perfect for her. I'm going back to buy a few more for my kids."
1,My daughter loves this tablet. Easy to use and great battery life.
1,"This is my second Kindle Fire tablet. My first works well. This was purchased for my teenaged son. He uses multiple apps; watches movies; surfs the web; does a bit of graphic design and occasionally reads a book. I use mine almost exclusively for reading and watching Netflix. I occasionally surf the web. Love that it has expandable storage, though I have not needed to use it yet. Would and will definately buy this product again."
1,"Will recommend this product.Easy to use, fast and efficient"
1,"If you use 'okay google' on your phone as much as I do, you'll love Alexa. No more having to pull your phone out, just ask alexa! She is a great house assistant!"
1,Definitely enjoy using this at home. I was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds. I mostly use it to play music through Amazon player. I know there's tons more it can do and can't wait to take advantage of all its capabilities.
1,We bought this for a handicapped friend. He is bedridden and can now access the world.
1,I purchased my first Kindle in 2011 and was using it up until it was stolen in May. I recently purchased a new Kindle and I like it for reading on my porch.
1,The resolution and contrast of the screen are excellent but the real selling points are how easy it is to read in natural light including bright sunlight and the battery life. I have only charged it once since I got it about 3 weeks ago.
1,"Love this tablet, I bought this for my nephew and he absolutely loves it."
1,The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.
1,"I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White."
1,I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners
1,"Easy to setup, fun to use. Use it daily for music."
1,"I won't leave home without it now! It allows me to take my library with me anywhere I go without having to lug dozens of books around. While I do enjoy the feel and smell of a good book, the kindle is an absolute delight to read from!"
1,I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
1,"Almost like reading a real book. Don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. I've held out from buying a reader for years because I could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. With this new kindle I don't even notice, I am immediately immersed. Wildly better than I expected."
1,We love Echo! Simple information given quickly and thoroughly. The speaker quality is excellent...we play music all day! Highly recommend!
1,"firebox is small but fast, runs great and takes no time at all to set up"
1,We purchased 3 of these for our kids and they love them.
1,Easy To Use  Long Battery Life  Quality Build  Quality Display
1,"I never thought I would buy a Kindle fire but I had purchased prime and discovered to be part of their lending library you have to use an Amazon product. Well, lucky for me Amazon had just released this 7"" Fire. I purchased it thinking the worst that could happen is I would be out $50.00. Well to my surprise the little tablet works very well. It is a perfect complement to the prime service and I have been very, very pleased. It is not a Samsung or an Ipad by no means but for what it can do it does it very well. I guess the best part to me like I said is it compliments the prime service beautifully. The O.S. system is almost flawless for watching Videos or reading books or the internet. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is not as good as the others overall but for $50.00 it is well worth it."
1,"I love to have books read to me but don't want to have to pay for Audible. Since regular Kindles have long sonce done away with speakers, I had to go to the Kindle Fire line. I was blown away! Not only can I read boops and do text to speech, I can also do netfkix, we surfing and check my email. I love me new fire and recommend it to everyone."
1,"Works for a child. It's a good tablet, I guess my complaint would be the charging port. Not very stable."
1,The Kindle Paperwhite has almost made my tablet obsolete. I read a lot and I was reading most of the books on a tablet. It was difficult to read outdoors even with a very good tablet. The Paperwhite is so easy to read anywhere in the the brightest of sunlight. I could not possibly put a higher recommendation on this product.
1,"The tablet convenient and the price is very reasonable. It is used daily for emailing, browsing, and game play."
0,I brought the tablet for my 9 year old son it's great for the kids can play lots of games download apps get on you tube ect but I don't like the fact every now and then it makes this weird sound and the screen blanks out and I have to turn the tablet off in order for it to work again.
1,"I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student."
1,Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
1,"I like the size and quality of the picture screen. user friendly, and apps are good. nice to have a library at your fingertips."
1,The ability to expand the memory ease of use and 4K comparability make this a versital 1 package entertainment tool.
1,"It has been a great device to read books, and the price is awesome too."
1,Sound is crisp. Alexa is always on point. We love it.
1,"It would be better if it had an additional out-put or could be wirelessly linked to another device or speakers. Additionally, it would be nice if it could make calls."
1,The amazon worked fine and I am glad I purchased the item
1,"I had always wanted a fire tablet and when this deal came along I couldn't pass it up! Great tablet and well worth the price! Lots of apps to choose from, easy to set up and use!!! I highly recommend this tablet for anyone!"
1,I think that it is easy to use and has a really nice sound
1,Love how light and battery life. Awesome!!! Would recommend anyone to buy this device.
1,This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
1,It's very nice tablet my kids love it and i am very happy
1,My son wanted this on Black Friday and it was the best purchase! I love that there is a kid mode just for him. I wish I had bought one for myself!
1,Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise!
1,This tablet is Affordible and supper useful! If your am Amazon kinda person I definitely recommend this
1,"Alexa does what she says, I have the Echo and dot, both are great. I like the echo because of the speaker to listen to music. I also appreciate the ability to check my calendar, set alarms, check weather etc."
1,Needed something for Christmas for five year old grandaughter. This hit the spot.
1,This is an excellent replacement for my Apple TV. I love it. Quick and easy to use. My whole family enjoys it.
1,Works so well I wore out my old one and had to have another
1,"Well worth the upgrade. Performance of UI and app has been significantly improved. Voice remote with Alexa is extremely convenient. UI summarizes available content by streaming platform which is extremely helpful. would recommend over other platforms, especially if you are an Amazon Prime customer."
1,The resolution on this screen is amazing and is so close to an actual printed page.
1,"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
1,"I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd."
1,"I like it ,it's money well spent. I will recommend it ."
1,I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet!
0,It's ok but not sure it's worth it chance of misorder
1,"Look no further excellent streaming device, great processor , good ram , expandable storage , also supports 4k what else could you ask for"
1,I love this item it's worth the prize my son loves the tsnley
1,Amazing thing instead of cable has amazing apps and cable programs for lower cost
1,This is a much better option than the Amazon Fire Stick. The picture quality is much better.
1,"Bought the kindle fire for my kids for Christmas . So far no issues, they seem to love it."
1,"This is a great Kindle, it is decent sized for reading and watching videos. It has an SD slot to add more storage so if all the internal memory is used, all you have to do is add an SD card and you're good to go! I would definitely recommend this Kindle!"
1,Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
0,Gave as a Christmas gift. Recently learned that it stopped working within two weeks.
1,"It's a reader, wanted to get the cheeper one but you were out of stock. this one works well"
0,Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
1,SHE WORKS GREAT JUST WISH i HAD WIFI AT HOME so it wasnt such a hassle reconnecting everytime
1,Nice size and very nice video quality. Finger swiping much more effective than using a stylus.
0,It was an okay purchase for my 6 year old. I definitely wouldn't pouches it for myself. Not much you can do on it.
1,Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.
1,good product with reference to price. little annoying with too many ads
1,love the products I bought for xmas presents they liked them alot
1,I liked this product and its very good for daily use.
1,"I love the Echo. The speaker is good, and Alexa is very fast and efficient at answering queries and following instructions. I had the Echo less than a month before deciding to get an Echo Dot for my bedroom."
1,This tablet is easy to use. Good for kids. Get a case !
1,"There's things she cant do that are very useful. Certain commands she cant do. Listening to music, weather, setting alarms, asking about your schedule, setting reminders=great."
1,I looked around at multiple e-readers and am so glad I chose the kindle paperwhite. It is very easy to read from and the backlighting still let's me read without having to turn on a light. I greatly enjoy it and certainly recommend it!
1,I bought the fire for my father for Christmas. The is his first tablet and I was afraid he would not use it. He has not put it down and it could not be more user friendly! I would recommend to anyone looking for a low cost tablet!!!
1,i like the tablet a lot its fast and easy to use and the price was right
1,My kids are growing out of their ipod touch and I wanted to get them something bigger. The kindle fire tablet is such a great deal so it was a no brainer to get all three of my kids one.
1,Enjoying Alexa and still trying to learn everything it can do. Looking forward to learning what all it can do.
1,"I got this to test it out to see if it would be good for my nieces' and nephews' Christmas gifts. Got to say, impressed. I went ahead and purchaed several more. I mean, it is not a Nexus 7 or Galaxy Tab, but for the price point, you really can't beat it. The expandability is also impressive, too"
1,I purchase this as a gift and the recipient is happy with it
1,"Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos."
1,I bought the Amazon Echo as a gift to my niece! Both her and her family love it! It was easily linked to their wi-fi and it was also easily linked to their amazon accounts!! Great gift!
1,Use it for my shopping list and for timers. Use it for music and amusement.
1,A good product with annoying limitations like limited knowledge about things. It does not always access my music on command although the music is in Prime music
0,Works well but too much advertisements with little control over content.
1,The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.
1,"I purchased several of these tablets. It's great for kids (all kinds of parental controls), but I also purchased one for my 80yr old Mother. She loves the ability to skype, check email and read her magazines and newspapers each day. She's also discovered (on her own) several games and apps in the AppStore that she suddenly can't live without. I love that when she gets stuck on something (if she can't call me) she can contact Amazon and they log right into her tablet and walk her though the issue (for free).CONS: It's slow... not for advanced users."
1,Would recommend this tablet to friends and family. This is my third Kindle product.
1,"kindle Paperwhite is easy to use, lightweight, and perfect for the avid reader. It easily allows you to take book(s) with you wherever you go since it's so small, thin, and light. The battery lasts for SO long, it's easy to find where you left off by using bookmark, definitions are a press away, easy to read in the dark (a book-light is not necessary!), and stores an enormous amount of books on one device."
1,"It's perfect, my granddaughter loves it!! She's catching on so fast and learning so much!! Easy for travel and on the go"
1,Wonderful tab. Great for beginners or advanced users. I sugg st a memory chip
1,"The best voice activated device I own. Gets it right 90% of the time. So easy to check weather, time, top news, alarm."
1,Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially.
1,Bought for 11 yr old Grandson. The look on his face made the money more than worth it. Kindle makes good products & I've been a long time Best Buy customer. never had a complaint.
1,It's very nice and useful. I will recommend this product.
1,"The Kindle Fire is easy and afordable for books,games, movies all on one device. I have owned 2 other Kindles in the past and will purchase another one when the time comes to replace the one i have now."
1,So easy to use grandson loves it nice starter tablet
1,"My second Alexa (I refuse to call it echo). This little toy wakes me up every morning and together with her little sister help me avoid burning my food, stay up to date with news, play my favorite music, control Hue Lights, remember things, and read. I slowly grew attached to Alexa and now it's a part of my life that I probably cannot live without. The one thing that I don't do with it is shopping (sorry Amazon) and I shop a lot. I find it cumbersome and unintuitive. Perhaps you can use it to reorder things that you are already familiar with. The sound quality is good enough. Every morning Alexa plays some upbeat music to jump start my day. It's not as good as my UE Megaboom; it lacks bass. Granted, not that many people would expect audiophile music quality from Alexa anyways.The problem with Alexa is still its rather disappointing app selection--both quality and quantity. But I guess the few goods one still imo justify a purchase. My advice is to get one and try it out for a couple of weeks. If it grows on you, keep it. If not, say bye. Alexa won't be sad at all."
1,Absolutely love it! Love the app store and the camera.
1,I'm glad I finally got one. Hard to get around Christmas time
1,Really great item for the kids and very user friendly
1,Good for reading novels.Also watching diy videos.

1,This was a gift therefore I cannot have a very good review of the item.
1,"Good Cable for Iphone. This Original OEM Apple USB Lightning Cable For iPhone This USB 2.0 cable connects your iPhone, iPad, or iPod with Lightning connector to your computer's USB port for syncing and charging or to the Apple USB Power Adapter for convenient charging from a wall outlet. 1M Long"

1,Loved it so much I bought another one for the bedroom. Now we have an Echo up and down. Also got 3 Dots for the kids to use as alarms.
1,"We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa."
1,Old Kindle first edition broke so I purchased this Kindle. Great product! New and improved. Super lightweight and love the background light.
1,"My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""iPad"", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial."
1,Found it to be very simple to use. I would recommend it to my friends.

1,Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy
1,"Alexa definitely makes life easier. The only downside is that she doesn't understand everything you say. I mostly use her for music, timers, and daily weather and news. The DOT doesn't have the sound quality of the full Echo, though"
0,"This tablet does what it supposed to do, however, if you have one of the newer smart phones with a large screen there just isn't enough difference in the screen size to justify a second piece of equipment."
1,"Bought this tablet for a family member who isn't very tech-savvy. Wasn't terribly pleased to see how overflowing the OS is with Amazon ads and services, but I suppose that's how they keep the costs so low on an extremely affordable tablet. Look up how to download the Google Play Store on this tablet to get even more usage out of it. With that addition, it works great, and they love it."
1,Great entertainment. possibilities endless.I love it
1,You can't beat the Fire tablets for the price. Can't tell much of difference with non Hd screen. Highly recommend

1,We really like all that it does its amazing device
1,It's light and it holds a lot of my books! I carry mine always in my purse.
1,We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad
0,"I bought this on Black Friday, simply because it was dirt cheap. It works ok but kinda slow."
1,The voice recognition is very reliable. Very easy to use use and can easily understand the response. Unclear if maybe paid sponsors have an advantage over non paid sponsors. Some information or references could not be found. Looking forward to connecting more home solution to the unit.
1,"Love the Alexa. She doesn't know as much as Google, but she is still great. I rely on her a lot. Worth every penny."
1,"Although this won't be competing with the iPad or some higher end android tablets, this easily outperforms any other tablet in this price range. I also love the fact that, although this is made of plastic, it has a unibody design and great build quality; not flimsy like many other tablets at this price."

1,I am pleased that it has all the apps she needs on it
1,This is a perfect device for the novice that expects superior performance and doesn't mind paying a little extra. No buffering and excellent 1080 quality.
1,"Briught my Kindle Paperwhite on a beautiful sunny cruise. It was wonderful. It's easy to read in the sun, or the shade. Simple to download books, easy to charge, held a charge for days worth of reading."
1,Very easy to setup and use. Fun addition to family entertainment with the jeopardy game!
1,Our echo has become indispensable in our house. Besides all of the questions we normally ask Alexa we also use it to turn on and off our lights through the Wink hub and stream music from Spotify. We love it!
1,The Amazon Fire is perfect for my son. He loves to play games and the app store is easy to use!
1,My kids love there new tablets they were affordable and easy to use my kids love them
1,"Overall, this 7"" tablet perfoms well. It's not the fastest, brightest, or thinnest on the market. But for $50 it is an great value. It doesn't come with the Google Playstore pre installed it can be easily added."
1,A friend recommended the tablet and I am happy with it.
1,"I had receive an Echo Dot as a present. Its only real weakness was that it was not a good enough sound quality for music. I messed around with external speakers by Blutooth and hard wired, nothing was convenient.. The sound quality on the Echo is good enough for casual listening of music and news."
1,This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.
1,"It has a great screen, you can add more memory with a micro SD card. This little fire is as powerful as pricy tablets."
1,I purchased 2 Kindle Fires one as a gift & one for me & liked them so much that I wanted to get one for my daughter & 5 yr old granddaughter - my daughter said she has not yet gotten a chance to use it but my granddaughter loves it! You can do just about everything on the Kindle that you can do on a laptop or desktop! Very happy with them. Might have to get another one for my daughter!
1,Birthday gift for wife. Her other tablet battery only lasts a hour. She wanted another one. Great tablet for the price.
1,"I bought this to read books and to use the internet, I liked it so much I bought a second one for a family member."
1,"I do most of my things on my laptop but I wanted something to use while watching TV and so on. I saw this tablet and had to look twice because I thought maybe it was just a reader! I have used this installing apps, playing games, reading, texting on a free text app, Facebooking and so on. The apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well. The clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range. The tablet feels of good quality. It is not flimsy and cheap feeling. We bought two and are extremely happy. The trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet. Love it for what it is ;)"
1,Purchased for youth gift as starting tablet. The Best Buy Cyber Monday one of the best price for purchase. Will be able to determine operation of such once the tablets have been opened and operational.
1,While Alexa doesn't know all the answers to our questions she is surprisingly smart and is getting smarter. We haven't tapped into all her features yet choosing to savor each new discovery. We are very pleased and having a great time with our new family member.
1,Having a Kindle is awesome. It makes it very easy to read and I gobbled up over 800 pages before I had to charge it for the first time since I got it. Great purchase!
1,"Bought 2 of these for 2 of my nephews and they love it! Keeps them occupied for hours at a time as they explore the features it offers, especially all of the free games they're able to download and play. Was a better gift for my lil sis who now gets a break while the tablets babysit ;)I like the sleek design, the quality feel of the materials, the sharp graphics, beautiful colors and fast response of the tablet. Also, for the price, not many others are comparable. Setup wasn't as easy as some I've had in the past, but we got it done. Would definitely recommend this for anyone in the market for a cheap but quality tablet!"
1,"replaced a lost one with this, nice upgrade to the older version"
1,"Kids love this to access Facebook and all their games, it's very easy to set up and use"
0,once I learn how to use all of the apps I am sure I will enjoy it more but I do have trouble scrolling
1,This box is as good or better than my Apple TV (latest version) with more options.
0,Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired.
1,"With a new higher resolution display, Bookerly font, and long lasting battery, the Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-readr in the market today. Reads like real paper. The device capabilities are complemented by Kindle's vast e-book store."
0,Purchased the Kindle fire fir my grandfaughter and she loved it. It was so easy for her to use. The size was perfect http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/

1,got this for my nephew and he loves it. easy to use and has great sounds and picture quality
1,My mom lives her tablet! She is obsessed with it!!
0,"Bought two of these tablets for my stepson and mother-in-law for Christmas. Not bad items for the price. Basic tablets,basic features, nothing special about them. They use them for connecting to the internet, playing games and watching movies. This tablet does this well on wi-fi. I expect them to perform well for the next couple of months."
1,"I bought this as a gift for my elementary school aged niece. She immediately put it to work playing games and watching video. Her face lit up and in the nearly two months since I purchased it for her, she's had no problems!"

0,"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft."
0,give this tablet to my son and was very happy with it!
1,"I love the Amazon fire. Easy to use, just plug and play!"
1,"It's great for doing anything on Amazon. However you cannot use Google cards to purchase anything with. They're great for reading books surfing the net games, are abundance and the processor is fast so you really don't have a lag"
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet is a pretty solid tablet reader for a very low price. Reading Ebooks is very comfortable and there are some really great apps available through Amazon's App Store. The one drawback is the web browser; it's a bit sluggish. This tablet is great if you are looking for an e-reader, and the price is outstanding, but if you are looking for an actual tablet computer you should look elsewhere. Don't buy this expecting it to perform as well as an iPad; it just isn't that kind of device. Overall, though, I really like this."
1,"My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books."
1,My teen daughter luv it and is having fun with her...
1,"This is great for when you link your accounts and ask Alex to play them for you, however her AI and speech recognition still need some improvement. Pairing your mobile devices to the echo is great as well for all those services not yet supported by Amazon."
1,Bought it as a gift for my aunt. She says that she loves it uses it everyday! Does a lot more than her old Kindle.
1,My kids love their kindle. Its the perfect tablet for adults and kids to share.

1,"This is 3rd Amazon reader I bought, plus several Fire sticks and Fire TV. All those devices are making my life nicer and helping to enjoy it. The reader is just great - a lot of flexible settings, support of many electronic book formats, possibility to read even in dark - what else do you need?"
1,Purchased this item for a book reader only. Kindle is one of the best as far as I am concerned.
1,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift
1,"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way!

1,Got it for Christmas and he loved it! Great for beginners.
1,"This is my first Kindle Paperwhite and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another when this dies. I own Nook readers and this is as good as those. (Some might say better, but for what I want in an ereader, they are pretty equivalent.) Very easy to use and comfortable to read."
1,"This little thing is great very light and the clarity is just right, I like the way it adjusts to light."
1,I bought this as a gift for my wife who loves reading. She has really enjoyed being able to. Andy this sleek reader in her purse when she's on the go.

1,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He was thrilled to receive it and hasn't put it down. I'm also glad it came with a power cord.
1,"We gave this to our son and his family. It fits right into their small patio and they are happy that our 5 year old granddaughter can play around it. It has endured heat, water bubbles, splash pool and her knocking it over."
1,"I have one that I love so that I purchased this to give as a gift, and the recipient loves it too!"
1,This is one of the most amazing products I have ever purchased!I highly recommend this product
1,"Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product!"
1,Works exactly as I hoped and have had no issues. There is virtually every app you might need available to you.
1,I bought the Amazon Echo to use mainly as a speaker to listen to music. I am learning to use other functionality that Alexa provides and it has been useful. Alexa understands my commands 95% of the time and allows immediate feedback on how it responds to my commands. Looking forward to using more of its functionality.
1,Best purchases I've made when it comes to items for reading. Battery lasts for days and weeks. The lighting source is awesome and adjustable. I recommend this to everyone who wants to have a book on the go but not carry anything too heavy.

1,Great the product is upto the mark kids will love it
1,Good product for the price - my granddaughter loved it.

I did have to exchange the original one because It was broken when we purchased it. Took it back to best buy got a Brand new one . And didn't have any more problems.
1,"The Echo is fun and informative...but it does not have the capabilities of Siri. They say it's a work in progress, we shall see. The voice recognition is ok but it does take multiple tries sometimes."
1,Keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it
1,The box is better than the stick must have for anyone that likes to stream
1,"This is a good product, value for money. It has everything one can expect in low price tablet."
1,Amazing for travel or being able to read when your partner turns out the lights.
1,"This is a great kindle for the price. Smaller travel size with enough power for general use. Does seem slower than other tablets but for a backup or travel companion, you can't beat it."
0,"The Echo is good, but doesn't know the answer to what I consider, some basic questions. i.e. 3 top scoring players in the NBA. I suppose as it updates info, more information will become available."
1,"Ever since I had my fire TV jail broken and programmed, I can finally cancel my cable subscription. Everything I once paid for on cable, my fire TV (KODI app) does for FREE!!!!!"
1,This is the best streaming device I have purchased yet. Hooks to Ethernet and is lightning fast!
1,An easy transition from my Nook! I only wish I could migrate my purchased books from Nook to my new Kindle.
1,Bought this on black friday for my neice and she loved it...super cheap but very good tablet
0,I hope to use it once I figure out how to use it. I am trying.
1,I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
1,"The Amazon Echo can do it all. I use it mostly to play music, set timers, and ask it questions but will eventually use it to control household items."
1,We love it! So much fun for everyone in the family! We happen to have The Nest thermostat after a few try's I figured it out! Played some of the skills with my Grandkids it as just great fun!
1,Picture quality is so much nicer than my old reader.
1,I like the Kindle. My first one died a quick death and took all me important apps with it. No idea how to get them back.
0,The kindle continues to freeze up when watching a movie. It will also freeze randomly.
1,I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it!! The reviews were excellent

1,"i love it, good sound quality, much better than amazon tap plus alexa is best"
1,The resolution is great and the battery life is amazing.
1,nocomment
1,It is lightweight and fits nicely in my purse. Light is just right for bed reading. Works well in sunlight.
1,Great Tablet for Beginner. Easy to use and navigate.
1,Purchased these for a few christmas gifts to give away.
1,This is a great alternative to cable. I get all my amazon videos and streaming apps for a lot less than paying for cable and the picture quality is streamed at 1080p. Happy with purchase.
1,I was also skeptical about buying the Amazon echo because of the price. I was able to get mine on sale for $100. I wasn't sure how much I was gonna use Alexa. Turns out I use her everyday. From weather to traffic conditions on my commute. Alexa is quick and responsive. When she's paired with smart bulbs and other smart accessories it's really convient to have her. Alexa is easy to set up and worth the buy.
1,I would recommend a kindle fire to everyone. My kids love them and love amazon!
1,got it as a reader and browser. portability and price cannot be beat!
1,Just love it. Easy to set up and use. Tons of information and jokes. Plays all my music and give spots scores.
1,Would buy another...and would recommend to all.AAA
1,"Item purchased for my daughter as a gift. She is an avid reader, and loves the Kindle"
1,"Alexa is a wonderful addition to the technology in the home. ""Ask Alexa and you shall receive an answer. From weather to sports scores, you will get the scoop."
1,"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
1,My 5 year-old nephew said that this was his favorite Christmas gift. That's all I needed to hear to recommend this to friends.
1,Box works faster than the stick as long as your router is close to the TV or Fire Box. Great Product!
1,"It's endless fun, it know's how to spell words, sings happy birthday etc. Sadly I don't use it as much as I want to, other things to do etc. But it's there when I need to use it. SWEET!"
1,Great sound! Amazing device! Nothing but good things to say about it.
0,I mainly got this united to task advance of Spotify Connect but the unit would lockup if I tablet or phone that I using times out. I have to reboot the device in-order for spotify to recognize the Fire device again.
1,"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
1,I bought the Voyage kindle as an anniversary present for my wife and she LOVES it. The new dim light feature and matted glass screen are pretty amazing and work like a charm. She's able to read in all manner of lighting and places. This is a great eReader.
1,"Easy enough for a toddler to use. Helps her with learning to pronounce words better so Alexa can understand what is being asked. I like the handsfreedom with just using my voice. Also, since I don't have a home phone, allows me to use the app to connect with people I need to speak to in my dwelling."
1,Love it! I use it for reading and Netflix and hulu
1,I really like this product. Work well. I don't need cable anymore.
1,For it being a Amazon tablet it does everything you need it to do on a general point.
1,I'm glad I made this purchase. I can now choose from hundreds of movies to watch. The Amazon fire tv allows for storing personal pictures and seeking assistance from Alexa. Great buy! I do not ever plan on paying for digital or cable TV again.
1,"Bought for our child who has vision issues but LOVES to read.  She can borrow library books and they return ""automatically"". Appreciate that the screen lighting is more gentle than other tablet items. Grateful for no game options. Wish I could control the ads better! That's my only complaint. Some advertised books are plain wrong for a young one but there it is with a sample or picture. Just gotta keep an eye on that."
1,"Bought this for our 7 year old son for Christmas. Took it on a 1,000 Mile drive and it was great for watching movies and playing games. Only complaint we have is he was unable to download Madden Mobile on it. Not sure if it's the operating system or something else. Great size and would highly recommend as a cost effective tablet."
1,I love my Kindle Voyage. It truly is almost like reading a paper book.
0,"bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids"
1,I have enjoyed my Kindle. I am a hoping they can upgrade the resolution in the future.I love the bigger screen as my vision is impaired. Definitely a keeper as I love reading.
1,"I bought this speaker for my nephew , he is 25 and he loved it. It is a great speaker. It can understand most commands. Sound quality is very good. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a rechargeable battery. It has to be plugged in all the time , no battery."
1,"This product works as advertised. Was very skeptical at first, but am happy with my purchase."
1,"I like the convenience of having information within seconds, but there's room for improvement with the software data capacity."
1,I got 3 of these tablets for my grandchildren and they use them constantly. Very good price. A little difficult to set up.
1,Wife's favorite of all the Kindles. She sold her Fire.
1,I definitely love using the echo and it makes certain tasks a lot easier
1,I own one there great to have in the room and a lot of enjoyment of all the things it does !
1,I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
1,"As a Google Home user I was excited to try its direct competitor, Amazon Echo, since a lot of people that I know have an Echo and are enjoying theirs so far. The setup process is very simple and requires you to download Alexa App for your mobile device. The Alexa App definitely needs more improvement as I found myself having to relaunch the app at times to reconnect the Echo to my wireless network. Alexa has bluetooth connectivity which is great for streaming music from my iPhone, something Google Home does not have currently. The mic is very sensitive which I like so I don't have to speak too loudly to wake the Echo up and it picks up voice from the far end of the living room; the Echo is located in the dining room. Sound quality is pretty good and music did not have too much distortion at higher volumes.The Echo's is more on the heavier side which I like cause I feel the build quality is good. The Echo is tall so the tall black cylinder stands out in my dining room table. I like the 360 speaker and mic design. Volume control can be adjusted by twisting the top upper ring which is simple enough. Amazon Echo uses Bing for querying answers to your questions and this is definitely where I think Echo takes a hit. There were quite a few simple questions I asked Echo that Google Home had no problem answering. Google search is the best, bar none.One of the bonuses of Amazon Echo is surely felt if you are a Amazon Prime member. For example, I asked Echo to check my order status for items I ordered on Amazon and it told me I had items out for delivery today. Also you can ask Echo what are today's deals on Amazon and it asks whether you want to buy the item it mentions. There is a lot of potential and more benefits for Amazon Prime customers.Overall I really enjoyed using the Amazon Echo and I am impressed with the design and build quality. Amazon's usage of Bing for searching is definitely lacking compared to Google. This is a solid complimentary assistant for Amazon Prime Members. Bluetooth is a plus for sure.PROS: Solid build and design quality. Good audio quality. Sensitive mic. Perfect for Amazon Prime Subscribers.CONS: Amazon Bing search is not nearly as good as Google. Alexa App needs improvement."
1,"Light weight, long battery life. Love the back lighting"
1,"I have really enjoyed this purchase in the month that I have had it. It is very versatile, responds to many voice commands, makes additions to my calendar - and it has a great speaker. I recommend."
1,Bought it on Black Friday as a gift for my mom. She's told me about 16 times how much she loves it. The only trade off is a smaller screen but still a great buy for the price
1,"I'm so excited when I got Alexa. She is hands free assistance. While I'm cleaning, I can speak commands to her or just ask questions. It's amazing how you can dual task. I wish Alexa could work on voice command through the app though. Like a Siri. I also can't wait for the Echo Dot to be released next month. I need one in every room. I would definitely recommend this."
1,This device is absolutely amazing. We use it for something everyday.
1,I was skeptical at first but really enjoy all the features
1,"Was undecided between new PaperWhite and Voyage models and doing a lot of research to see which one is best. Based on some personal analysis on in-store samples, I felt the Voyage has nothing more price worthy than what new PW could offer with lesser $$$. If you are undecided like me, don't worry about the gimmicks of voyage, go for PW.."
1,I bought this Kindle primarily for traveling and quickly fell in love with it. I love the appearance and weight.
1,"Easy to setup, very helpful to have. We stream music all day thru it. Also great for creating shopping lists. Just add items when you are thinking about them, quick easy. Makes grocery shopping easier and you save money because you have a list!"
1,work great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This is a great tablet for reading or searching the Web for idem's
1,This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
1,"Does everything my IPhone does (except make phone calls). with a wifi connection....no plans or extra fees....Facebook, Pandora, Gmail, Internet in addition to downloading books!"
1,I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday. She loves it!
1,"We purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. She took to it immediately. It connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5; search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the Fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. The camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey... Sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity."
1,Wonderful price and service at Best Buy would tell friends about it
1,Excellent for minor task. Excellent for Video watching.
1,"Easy to operate, a child can use it, mean apps. The camera and chat an Time are a very good feature. Amazon make it easy to use."
1,Great for the home or office. The music sounds great and it can hear from across the room.
1,The one thing I miss is the google store. some games i love to play aren't available.
1,After plugging my Echo in and downloading the Alexa app the rest of the process was nice and easy. I just added all my music accounts and my smart home devices and from then on Alexa has been an amazing device. Anyone looking for a device that can help with home automation should get an Echo.
1,"Bought this for my grandson, fits his hands just right. Love that i could buy and sdcard to enlarge the memory. He loves it."
1,Useful and fun tool for helping with household maintenance
1,"It's worked well, great value for the price, good speed, overall a good bang for the buck."
1,Purchased Amazon Fire for my sister-in-law. She really likes it. It uses it for mainly reading her books.
1,I wanted something small to read books on on the go. This fit the bill perfectly! Not to big and not to small. It does more things than I was expecting!
1,"Clear voice recognition. Works with other devices other then amazon, interconnects well and easy. Regularly expanding support for new features. Fun to use. Decent speaker, plug in and leave as easy to use. ."
1,"I gifted this product to my brother, he liked it a lot.Better Battery life and light to read in night is really useful."
1,"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!"
1,"I bought my Echo when it first came out. I Love It! It made a very nice Christmas gift. My mother was thrilled. I thought I knew a lot of things to ask it but she has me beat already. She lives alone and loves having it ""talk to her"". She's hooked up her lights to it (by herself) and loves that she can have the lights turned on before she heads downstairs. I don't walk out the door without asking Alexa the weather for the day. It's a fun thing to play around with stupid questions, she has quite the sense of humor!"
1,the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os
1,Glad we bought it very informative and smart can answer anything you ask
1,I have loved Amazon's Kindles from the start. Everything is user friendly and Amazon's customer service can't be beat!
1,The fire stick is easy to use and set up. I wish it were easier to search for movies and shows.
1,"I bought both the Amazon Echo & Echo Dot. The Echo provide better music, obviously, because of its taller size. I liked the slick design. Still exploring and awaiting the many more things I can do with it."
1,I love love love this tablet. My old hp tablet finally quit working and check around what would serve my needs and this was it
1,Love my kindle! Highly recommended to anyone that reads regularly or travels. We use it for reading on the go and even to access Netflix and email on a device larger than a cell phone but smaller than a computer.
1,"Easy to use, was worth the $50. Wish you could access google store with it but other than that, works great."
1,Purchased to use in conjunction with PlayStation VUE. Fire TV offers the guide menu and is recommended by many. So far very Pleased!
0,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
1,"Bought this during the black friday sale for $35 and can't complain at all. Keeps my kids busy, and runs hearthstone, that's all I need."
1,"I can't tell you how much enjoyment I have received from just listening to the music , and meditation program.Once you understand all of the functions, it is wonderful, most of all if you are housebound."
1,"It's pretty cool to have, and do some other mods to it since I own it, great item"
1,"I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
1,Nice device not bad on sale. You get what you pay for.
1,We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY
0,"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
1,"it is excellent. easy to use. kids use it easily. durable, been dropped a few times and still works"
1,Use this on flights to watch movies and pass the time!
1,I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.
1,This is a nice item. I recommend this to everyone.
1,Very easy to use and it's everything that I wanted and thought it would be
0,"Although faster than the stick and smart tv apps, it still needs more on stability and better connection for everyday use. Mot worth it if it was more expensive. Still ok."
1,It's great for the price. Easy to use and kid friendly.
1,"Easy to set up and use. The grandchildren, my wife and I all had a lot of fun with the echo."
1,"So far I have had no issues with my tablet, although I admit I have not fully used all its capabilities."
1,This reader is everything I hoped for this price range.
1,So happy to find this item in store--salesman made sure the price was lowest possible.
1,"Small, light weight and easy to read. Read in the bright sunlight with no glare and read in the dark without disturbing anyone."
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is great for reading anywhere, even at the beach! You can also read it in bed with the lights out so you don't disturb anyone else. I absolutely love it! I have a Kindle Fire, an iPad, and a Samsung Galaxy 4 and the Kindle Paperwhite is far better than any of those for reading!"
1,I have a short term memory problem....going from the kitchen to find my phone to add something to my shopping list...I can forget that easy...being able to speak and add things to a list and have that list on my phone where ever I go...AMAZING...and that is just one perk...I love this item!
1,The Echo Black is worth the extra money to get the bette sound quality! No problem. Has performed superbly! Another great Amazon device!
1,It's my only access to television these days. All I need is a wifi internet connection to the house. I have thoroughly enjoyed using it. It works great.
1,I like this tablet alot but it was really hard to understand at first.
1,"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
1,"I bought two of these tablets for my twins (8 yrs old) for $34 each on Black Friday. I thought $49 was a bargain for this tablet. My kids have really enjoyed them. I was pleasantly surprised with the picture quality and everything this tablet had to offer. If you're looking for a basic tablet or one for your young kids, without spending a lot of money, this is worth it."
1,"I got this after returning google home, because I had multiple bedrooms and I wanted a platform to connect them together, you would had to buy multiple google home which is expensive solution, however with echo you can combine it with alexa dot -which is a lot cheaper- in the rooms that you don't need large speakers and keep echo in the living room or so. I found that I can integrate a lot applications and devices through Alexa app which wasn't available in google home. I would definitely recommend you getting this product verses google home."
1,"My son loves it for the music, I love it for the daily news flash. We love it!"
1,"This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
1,"The power cord works well however, I am still trying to see if I made a mistake in buying the 5. I love its size but it should have better functions then the older models or I just don't get it.. I should know because this is my 10 th Kindle."
1,It was so easy to set up the first time and add books. Easy to read clear screen and big words.
1,Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.
1,this is my first tablet and so far it has been great. Games and apps. all loaded fast and worked great. Wish battery was stronger but I use it around the house a lot and plugging it in is not a problem and it charges fast.
0,good ereader not great for surfing web good for children and reading
1,I bought this for my niece. She uses this for E-books. Better than having to store tons of books in her case.
1,Enjoyable to have so much music so readily available. Also great to have songs from back in the day so readily available. Having a weather forecast at voice command helps things run more smoothly in the morning. Very convenient to have a timer available even though your hands are sticky with dough or meatloaf. The ap is also good for finding new skills.
1,Perfect addition to our kitchen and can't have picked a better product for our home!
1,"I LOVE MY KINDLE! I surf the web, take pictures and play games on it. I use it everyday."
1,"Good product, decent sound, not as good as Sonos though."
1,"Although it isn't really a necessity, it is truly fun to own. Alexa isn't as savvy as Siri; but the ability to play any song on command; and with accessories turn devices on and off is worth the expense."
1,Bought this as a gift for my 75+ year old parents and they are having a blast with it.
1,I have an Amazon ECHO and the Fire TV integrates nicely with the ECHO. The Amazon TV is faster than the FIRE STICK as it has memory to buffer streaming video and present it in what appears to be real time
1,Super easy to use and small enough to carry in my purse
1,"It works! It's a plug, what more can I say"
1,Great reading device under all lighting conditions
1,"I love my kindle for reading over my iPad now. Best buy gave me a good deal on this kindle, and fast and friendly service. This kindle is easy on my sensitive eyes and a pleasure to hold. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an e-reader."
1,Great device! Works well. I'm impressed with some of its abilities.
1,Really good quality piece and would strongly recommend
1,it is a good table for children and it has a good price.
1,"Fire TV,is just what it says.I found that this streaming player eliminated any buffering issues I had.I also enjoyed the voice activation feature,and it's accuracy in recognition.Save yourself some time, and just buy it now."
1,"Integrated easily with ecobee3, insteon products. Music playing capability is great with prime membership"
1,"A great entry level tablet, all other tablets at that price don't stack up."
1,Love it Cheap and good tablet. Has no memory but it's ok it does what I need it to do and my niece loves it! She's entertained! Would buy more!
1,"My wife purchased this for my birthday and we find it to be VERY helpful. Very easy to use. Perfect size to be placed conspicuously in the home. It's an all-around great tool for parties, up-to-date info every morning, list keeping, calendar maintenance and general fact checking. We love it!"
0,Made a nice Mother's Day gift.......................
1,"Great tablet! Perfect size. I bought this on Black Friday, couldn't beat the price!"
1,My son was very pleased with this kindle and will read more often now.
0,It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
1,Speaker has good sound for small space. The voice command is in point
1,A family member got the echo dot for their birthday and we played with it for a while and were very entertained so we bought this version because we enjoy our music a bit louder and fuller.
1,I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.
1,This thing works pretty good. That is unless you are trying to stream Directv Now reliably. Probably not Amazon's fault though. Everything else works flawlessly.
1,"I am still learning what all the Echo can do but it is awesome. I love the shopping list, the timer, just being silly with games. Working on getting plugs and light switches to control the house."
1,I have a older kindle loved it. I love the new storage on this one and easy to use buttons. Great battery life.
0,"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone."
1,I bought this for my 6 year old and he loves it. So easy to use and navigate.
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandma and she was able to learn to use it right away. This is a great tablet for someone who is a beginner when it comes to technology.
1,Alexa answers questions easily. I like tha she is always available. It takes a while to realize she isn't totally like Siri. alexa will give specific answers to questions like what's the weather today. Or play specific music. I Like that.
1,"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all."
1,"I purchased this versus the regular FireStick because I have a 4K TV and I must say, the quality is amazing even after applying KODI. I love this product"
1,I only use it for display mirroring but it will work for other things that it's intended to do. It works good.
1,"if you don't need a hi-res camera (you've got one on your phone) and you don't plan to watch movies on your tablet, this Kindle is the one for you! It doesn't have all the ""bells and whistles"" but it works great for reading books and playing aps."
1,"I'm enjoying using this, though it occasionally can't understand me, especially during the word game. I love asking for music, any kind, and have it play. I love that I can use it to set alarms, to ser time limits, to ask the weather and to have Alexa tell me corny jokes. Recently I purchased the wifi plugs, but I haven't set them up yet."
1,"We are loving our Alexa. I am ready to get the Dot for another room. The speakers sound phenomenal for the music! She will connect you to radio stations for your music preference as well. I am a prime member, so be careful when your kids start to talk to her. Make sure you do the parental settings in your Amazon account, if not your kids will be signing you up for trial memberships from Amazon. My 7 year old thinks this is cool & loves to ask her things."
1,Easy to setup and connect. Works well with various apps
1,"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base."
1,Using this with Playstation Vue for TV and HBO Now. It works great!
1,Gave up on Apple TV and tried this sucker out. Has Sling TV and Plex among Amazon Prime so it's very good compares to other streamers out there.
1,This has been the best cost effective tablet for my kids. Love the easy child protection options
1,"If you dont mind taking a few extra steps to download programs then its great. We got rid of cable and have amazon instead. Also love the voice command, just wish game controller wasn't so much the systym was 99 and the game controller is 50."
1,I actually bought for grandkids to use as they fight over iPad. they can each play abc mouse or nickjr. downloading apps is quick and easy with many to choose from. Sale price was awesome. I also plan to download apps for me as well as using for ebooks on vacation.
1,Needed something to use when out and about and this was perfect
1,"Awesome product, fell in love with it the minute I turned it on"
1,I have a Kindle Voyage and wanted another reader because I read a lot. I decided for the Paperwhite as it's just a tiny bit heavier than the Voyage but just as good. I highly recommended it.
1,Love my amazon is amazing for the price I paid and what the tablet does i am glad not pay for a samsung tablet more expensive and do the same
1,"Wanted something to take with me. (I don't use a smart phone), Quick looks at the web, When I'm away from the desktop, Also some games."
1,"Small, light easy to read in any lighting. If you are looking for a device that serves one purpose, to read books anywhere, this is for you."
1,Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.
1,"Light and easy to use. Like its feature of back light, by which eyes did not feel sour even with long time of reading."
0,ok product serves the purpose nothing more than that
1,My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel.
1,This is an absolute life saver for small children.
1,Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up
0,"Not much need for this thing, good price, but makes one wonder if they were on sale because they really don't do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet. Not impressed at all."
1,I will know which charger is mine
1,"I love the fact, I can read in bed at night, and the backlight is adjustable so it does not bother my husband sleeping. Only negative is it takes a few longer seconds then I would like to power off."
1,It's no iPad but for the price it can't be beat. Mostly use as e reader and the screen is excellent and perfect size for on the go.
1,Perfect price and just enough memory for anything. Perfect size great quality this is the 5th one I bought for someone. Pictures are great also
1,Purchased for my niece and she loves it. I like the fact I can set limits on her tablet and restrict her access until she has read. Only downside is the case doesn't have a kickstand so that the tablet can be placed upright for viewing videos/movies. But a new case can be purchased.
1,"I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband."
0,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
1,Great small size tab that easy to keep up with. Not too big and not too small
1,"Great for accessing satellite radio, information searches, weather reports, etc."
1,"use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet"
1,"I use this tablet mostly for reading manga but I also enjoyed reading books on it. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I can't install all android apps in it. Other than than, it's light weight, compact, easy to use. I take it everywhere with me. Amazing deal for the price."
1,"Bought this to replace a previous tablet that died. Popped in a 16 GB micro SD card to add memory. You need more, 8 GB is not much. This tablet throws plenty of marketing at you, but in exchange you get a lot of functionality for not much money (I paid 40 plus tax). If you like intense gaming, you'll be disappointed I think, its not super powerful. True it cannot run Android apps, but its an Amazon product, so there are lots of apps out there. For my light weight needs, it works well."
1,I recommend this product highly if you want to stop paying high cable /satellite bills.
1,I had been doing research on wether to get an echo for a long time already had to take advantage of the sale.
1,I love talking to alexia and asking her questions. I play music on it and don't have to go turn something on. Being able to talk and have her respond is awesome. Next I want to get the lights set up in my house so she can turn everything on.
1,"This is a lot of fun. It makes access to news, music, and home automation easy and a lot of fun."
0,"i am hoping will we happy with this fire tablet,, have a kindle fire from 2 years ago i really like, but this is so cheap am a little worried, but heard good things and that it is a bang for the buck! hope so! :)"
1,Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having. Couldn't go wrong with the two year no worry gurantee and the one year free subscription of Amazon FreeTime. Have had for about a month and it was been well worth the money already.
1,I bought a tablet few months ago is very good quality I like it a lot for watching youtube videos and i bought 2 more tablets for a gift
1,highly recommend this product to all book lovers...
1,Love it! Best gadget I have purchased in a long time!
1,like the wihite background and its really easy to use anywhere
1,My son loves it. The picture and quality is great and my so loves all the apps from the characters he loves
1,We really love our new Amazon Tap. My Son enjoys playing with it.
1,I purchased a Galaxy phone and received the Fire tablet for free. I do use it to read books to my son. He mostly uses it to play his games. It does the job!
1,"Overall a good tablet. The screen is crisp enough to enjoy videos. The only downside is the built in speakers. Even with headphones, the sound quality isn't top notch. Just average. If you're not looking to do anything fancy. It's a good deal."
1,We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
0,"Its a good tablet, screen is kind of weird but it does its job. I wish the it had more memory but for the price, I can't expect to much for a inexpensive tablet. But what I do love is that all the apps are free so that's a #SCORE. Great for kids"
1,I had an Amazon Fire Stick for the house before I bought the Fire TV. I wanted to get rid of cable and just stream. The Fire TV is fast and you barely see any buffer or lag. I had it for about 2 hours and loved it and decided to canceled my cable subscription. Totally worth it with this on my tv now.
1,She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
1,I bought this tablet to hold all of my digital sheet music and refer to it at rehearsal. It works great for the intended purpose and the price was right.
1,Good cheap tablet. Not very powerful but it does the basics.
0,meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
1,"Perfect, just needs an app to locate when set aside"
0,Use it a lot for listening to audio books. Too many ads.
1,Got it for my daughters birthday. We all enjoyed the echo. Thinking of getting another for myself.
1,"I used daily and its works awesome, the price and performance are good I suggested to my friends , bought last yrs as well gave to my dad, he loves it."
1,The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
1,Bought this to streaming media in HD and 4K and it works great. Only bad thing is you need a high speed HDMI to be able to streaming in 4k.
1,I'm so happy with my purchase. I use it mostly as a Kindle. It's a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading. Proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue. It performs better than I expected for a $49 tablet . My wife returned her $800 iPad Pro after a week of comparing the two devices. Only 4 stars because of the weight and the home screen advertisements. Both are minor issues.
1,Great item to have. Consolidate all your apps to watch shows. No issues at all.
1,Easy to use and great resolution for viewing high definition content
1,"I'd recommend this to everyone. Even if you have no computer knowledge, you can be a expert"
1,"It's a good addition to the gadgets. Alexa helps manage shopping lists, connects to phone using Bluetooth to play music apart from the music on Amazon Prime. Alexa has a pretty good collection of jokes and can keep kids at home entertained.I plan on purchasing Hue range of lights that can be controlled using Echo soon."
1,"I would recommend this to anybody who streams on line, or uses Kodi"
1,"Recipient very happy, good product, makes it easier for recipient to do email and play his games. Too hard on eyes to do on cell phone and more convenient than PC,"
1,It functions well and meets all my needs as an entry level tablet. The only downside is that everything on it is geared toward amazon but the price makes up for it.
1,This is a great streamer at a great price. I really enjoy using it.
0,unit must be charged frequently still trying to learn the fire
1,Does everything I want and then some. Now streaming sirius xm.
1,It a great speaker and also a great personal assistant.

1,Purchased for Christmas for my grandkids. The perfect gift to keep them off my phone using my data.
1,I love my kindle I take it everywhere with me. It's lightweight fits in my purse just great deal!

1,Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy!
1,Great tablet especially for the price.Brother loved it for Christmas.
1,"We originally purchased the Echo to play music in our master bedroom/bathroom leveraging out Amazon Prime account. Now that we've been using it we've found countless uses for it. We're so happy with it we just bought the new Echo Dot. The speaker in the Echo is great. We purchased the Echo Dot for areas of our home that already had a good music system, but we wanted the other great features Echo has outside of playing music."
1,"I love what it can do, and how helpful it can be. It is very easy to setup and then it just works. On top of that you can teach it more with skills. All in all this is a great little device!"
1,Great Family Christmas Gift! Fun for the Whole Family!!
1,"This is my 4th Kindle Fire. When we go on road trips each of the kids in the back of van are occupied watching movies, playing games or reading books on the Kindle."
1,The tablet was nice. Lots of Amazon access. It would be a good thing for someone a little older.
1,This product is excellent would recommend to other people keeps all my stuff in on Unit
1,I love this kindle paperwhite. I can read it anywhere especially the beach.
1,I bought this product since my wife purchasers a number of books from amazon. We also wanted easy access to our emails.
1,Best bang for the buck. Can't be beat for reading. The best bookstore and readers experience.
0,It's an ok device. No more useful than a Bluetooth speaker connected to a smart phone.
1,"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
1,"I got this fire TV because my fire TV stick didn't get good wifi reception in my bedroom. It has wired networking, so it works great! It's snappier than the fire TV.stick and does the same stuff."
1,I purchased it as a gift for my son and he is very pleased with it.
1,"This tablet brings hours of enjoyment educationally to the user,"
0,Excellent product nysecond one will but again love read
1,It was a good tablet really easy for kids with great security
1,I bought 2 of these 1 for each of my daughters they have been great so far
1,Kids love it and use it a lot. No issues till now.
1,The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
1,bought it and loved it. Bought one for a friend. Ask Alexa anything.
1,The fire tv has been very easy to setup and use. I haven't missed cable one bit.
1,She is so amazing music quality great can ask her a lot and she controls smart devices
1,Great reader for reading in bed. Light weight easy to use.
1,My son and granddaughter love them. Clear screen and game play is great.
1,"This is a great starter tablet or tablet or kids. I bought one for myself and gave two as gifts. My daughter loves hers and uses it for homework, games, videos, and video chatting with my sister. I use mine to play games and web browse, as well as watch videos when I am waiting somewhere. I love the Amazon Music feature and use it to listen to music both in my car with the Bluetooth feature and my Bluetooth speaker system. I have Amazon Prime, so my experience has allowed me to get the most out of my tablet, but I cannot imagine using it without Prime. My only gripe is that devices on the same Prime account overlap content, which is a bit inconvenient when I am trying to keep my content separate from my daughter's. It is still a great buy and I am satisfied with my purchase."
1,"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
1,For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
1,blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
1,This is must have because streaming is the future of TV
1,My Kindle charges again.
1,I bought this to use outside by the pool. Perfect.
1,I recommend it Amazon-Fire This product is excellent ...
1,I just bought it like a couple of weeks ago and I'm already telling my fMily to get it. Love it. It works perfectly
1,Working great so far. Battery holds a charge much better and longer than old regular Kindle that we had. Best Buy did match lower price that they advertised days after I purchased this one. Very satisfied with product and Best Buy.
1,Works great even outside easy to learn how to download and settings
1,Kids loved it would buy again good storage works well
1,My kids are pleased.............I am happy I made this purchase!
1,Need to explore what to ask to get the most out of it.
1,"You know, for about a year now I've been thinking of getting a portable speaker, so when the Tap was on sale I decided that this was the perfect answer since I was already committed to the Alexa paradigm."
1,"excellent choice for a 3,8,10,and 11 year old child.i made a great choice when i decided to purchase 2 of the 7 inch tablets for christmas gifts.i am very pleased."
1,I bought this unit since it is compatible with 4K tvs and it is great.
1,"The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper."
1,"Best reader pad, comfortable and light, recommended for reading and studying."
1,Good tablet. I had to re-purchase apps through Amazon because Google play is not compatible
1,I like this product. I will recommend this product for friends and family. Thank you
1,Young readers don't have to keep up with a book. The tablet is good for young readers
1,Does exactly what it is supposed to do
1,"Love this tablet! It does everything! Accesses the web, downloads apps, games, music, movies,. You name it. I also purchased a cover and stylus pens for this tablet. For under $80 you wont find a better deal!"
1,"I have purchased a fire tab before for my wife. I would say it was the best consideration for a tablet. It lasted for a good time and I was really apprehensive from getting her one. It is durable in use, just don't go dropping it on cement. The only reason I gave a 4 star is because I haven't used it yet."
1,My granddaughter loves this tablet it is durable..
1,Great kindle. Easy to travel with. Works great in sunlight.
1,"Good all-around tablet, able to multitask many things."
1,"I brought this tablet for my mother, who's never touched a computer, and she loved it. It's great for beginners, and well worth the cost."
1,Great way to read books. The screen is readable in any light. Add a waterproof case and you have the perfect beach or pol side library!
1,fire TV has everything anyone would need for their digital entertainment. It's easy to set up and easy-to-use
1,I have several smart devices and light bulbs. I love using my Amazon Echo to control different devices.
1,easy to use and quality product for the price. primarily use as an e-reader
1,"It was time for me to upgrade and glad I did. This Fire HD 8 is bigger, more apps, easier to switch from one application to the other, features more songs, great addition of audible, and glad this version includes a charger. I love the fact that I can play movies and fall asleep. Once the movie is done, the table goes off. This is a cheap tablet, but you get more bang for your buck!"
1,This is a modern era personal assistant. Has almost all answers you ask & is still learning. Kids are getting use to it sometimes play and also getting educated. Very impressed with the sound quality has Dolby sound if you like listening music.
1,Still learning to use it. I wish it was compatible with Sirius XM radio .There are so many skills to enable.
1,I first saw the Amazon Echo at a friends house and purchased mine the very next week. It has become quite a conversation piece. My father liked it so much he has requested one for Christmas. I recently bought an Echo compatible smart plug device and love how it works.
1,"Works great as I would expect it too. Only complaint, why is this not just part of the kindle purchase instead of a separate line item."
1,"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read."
1,"Snagged it on sale for $39.95. Then got another discount from accumulated BB points. It's not HD, but I don't find that necessary on a small screen. I like the form factor, fits into coat or jacket pocket. Amazon app store lacks the number of apps of Google store but there are easy ways to install Google apps store. While you can use it for productivity tasks with a compatible keyboard I bought it for my wife to watch youtube and netflix shows on a bigger screen than her iphone. Its wireless signal pickup distance is a bit weak, but the ability to add storage via micro SD is nice. Even at $50 it is a good buy for what it is."
1,"Kindle Fire continues to be my fav device to keep in touch with family and friends...internet, Facebook, messenger, email, movies, books, music...does it all. I'm never bored!!"
1,This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
0,"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
1,Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Great product for price.
1,Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
1,I would like to buy this because it caught my attention.
1,"Easy setup, access to all my apps in one box. Requires reboots on a regular basis but runs very well."
1,We absolutely love the Kindle Fire. Much better than a regular tablet.
1,Tap is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.
1,My son's and daughter love it. They don't have a hard time understanding how to use it.
1,"the kids use it every chance they get, this is the fourth one we have bought."
1,"I had been searching for a reliable and durable tablet for my child, after various reviews I went through with purchasing a pair of the kindle fires. For my child it is perfect, he's able to play games and videos without much issues. Being a young child durability is required as was low cost, this item has more than met expectations. For an adult it is more a passable option as the os can be frustrating and the unit will lag on occasion."
1,My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others.
1,This is a great devise for reading books or taking photos. Best Buy Associate was very helpful.
1,"It has taken time for me to learn how to use it, but I have been able to: use on Europe vacation, download books & audio books from library, look quickly at multiple email accounts, & communicate with grown children through Facebook messenger."
1,It was a gift for a friend and she loves it. Would definitely recommend it
1,Was so glad to get rid of my cable bill for TV. There are a lot of free stuff out there that this will save me a ton.
1,"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent."
1,Love the fire tv. Does away with loading times on the fire stick.
1,Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly!
1,"I got this tablet just to try out because it's very inexpensive. I say it's great for basic browsing/shopping. As long as you're not expecting optimal performance, this definitely gets the job done."
1,This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.
1,"Great for playing all types of music, checking the weather, asking questions for things you're looking for, play games and so much more. Love Alexa. Can't wait to learn all the other things she can do that I haven't learned about yet. I would surely recommend it to anyone. You can also use it to run various things in your home."
1,I previously had a Roku however decided to purchase the Fire TV Box instead. It definitely meets all my needs and has been a real pleasure to use.
1,I like it so and so my kids like it very much.The application is amazing.
1,You get lots of movies & TV show from Amazon Prime
1,"Bought Paperwhite as a gift for my wife for Christmas. She cant put it down!, If she wakes up in the middle of the night the Paperwhite is on and it the light doesn't bother me."
1,Bought it for gifting purpose and it was worth. Good battery life and quick recharge. Perfect for small children
1,This is an absolute steal at the price! Great product with great functionality!
1,"I use this for time tracking, music and inventory control in our woodworking shop. Works great, easy setup and no complaints."
1,This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.
1,Great for streaming and learning games for kids. Good research tool for older kids.
1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! So easy to use...it exceeds our expectations in every way.
1,Bought this tablet for my Step-daughter for Christmas and she loves it so much I asked for one for myself!
1,"I have the first generation Kindle Paperwhite and my fiance has the latest and greatest. The screen clarity and response time is greatly improved and it's still being offered at the same price. If you're a bookworm who either reads before bed and/or travels a lot, a Kindle makes a lot of sense. I like that you can dial in the screen brightness so that you can still fall asleep after reading. The battery life is great, too!"
1,I bought this for my friend and I also like its shutterfly coupon. It is wonderful.
1,I bought it for a friend on christmas she love it. Very easy to use
1,Really a nice laptop for a good price. Also very good service from the salesman.
1,Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
1,I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.
0,"I'm not happy with It, you get what you pay for I will never buy it again."
1,This product is amazingly faster than the firestick and would recommend this over the stick any day of the week
1,I love that there is a free writing app that resembles Word and I can type documents which can be saved to Dropbox directly from the app.
1,"Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device."
1,It's an amazing product. Use it daily. Can't wait for updates
1,I gave it away. It was too nice for me. The person I gave it to was gleeful.
1,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We have been using a Nook for the last 2 years (bought at Best Buy - got 2 and a great deal) Can't use Nook to read in sunlight. The Voyage is smaller, lighter and easier to use. Have not used it yet to read in sunlight. Wish it had some other features like - color display and sound. Waiting to see if I decide to get one until then I still am using a Nook. Very easy to download a book from public library. It is a tad expensive for what it does."
1,"Initially I purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling Lutron lights. However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry."
0,Alexa is a great device. The only drawback is not being able to simultaneously stream all devices throughout the house. Hopefully Amazon is working on a solution
1,"We all love it. Everyone in the family uses it. I had my command changed to respond when I say ""COMPUTER"". Good fun. I am able to access my saved music from my computer or subscribe and listen to music on Amazon Prime."
1,We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
1,"It was a Christmas gift, not a big reaction at the time. He has very poor vision so I thought it would be a good gift. I think he is starting to like it as he uses it more and learns what he can do with it."
1,I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
1,Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it
0,My Alexa doesn't recognize Agoura hills. Does not play free music. How can I get those to work
1,Very good and easy to handle the price was very good
1,I have both Fire tv and the Fire Stick. The Fire TV can connect via cable to internet andcis definitely faster than the Stick. Also had more storage. If you don't need to connect wirelessly and don't mind the extra $$ get the Fire TV
1,Awesome tablet and what a great price!!!!! Would buy this tablet a million times over!!!!!!!!
1,"I really enjoy the Echo. I got an Echo Dot and liked it so much I then got the full size Echo. I originally go the Echo Dot for the novelty thinking I wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that I use them all the time. It is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. Some of the things it does really well: It's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. Setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying Alexa, wake me at 7 am Or Alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. If you are a Prime member the Echo is great at playing music from your music library or from Prime music. It's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). In the morning I'll say Alexa, play 680 WRKO to listen to Kim and VB on the radio. Some of the things the Echo is bad at: It's well known that it uses Microsoft's Bing search engine so most anything the Echo has to search for comes back with the response I don't know that. Being able to tell the Echo to use Yahoo or Google would make this a five star rating. Also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. For example, if I'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the Echo Dot) and say Remind me to call John Smith in 10 minutes and then I go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the Echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. It would be nice if I could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full size Echo as far as I can tell. The only difference is the full size Echo has much better sound for music. That being said, the Echo Dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. But the full size Echo is like listening to a stereo. Again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. Maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around."
1,Love it. You should get one!!!!! It's amazing!!!!!
1,"Not the quickest tablet out there, but it does the job and you can't beat the price. Great for reading books and magazines or light Internet browsing."
1,Works very well. It is perfect for my brother whom it was bought for
1,I've had Alexa for a few months already. I have her controlling my front door and all the lights in my house. I'm slowly getting my house to a smart house and she's a very good addition
1,I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb.
1,"The kindle fire 10 is a major upgrade from the original fire. My kids, 8 and 11, referred to it as an IPad when it was first received."
1,Works great. So easy to use. Can just ask and I get the answers.
1,"Other than occasionally misunderstanding and relentlessly asking us if we want to order xyz, this is a great product that I believe is just at the beginning stage of all the possible uses for it. My kids and their friends love asking Alexa to play music and I was surprised that a TP Link smart power switch I bought previously works with it to control my living room light. I just purchased a voice remote to go along with the Echo so I can control it from my bedroom while it is in the kitchen. A few times when attempting to turn the living room light on or off Alexa replied with ""Ok,"" but nothing happened. This may be due to wireless congestion or a blip for Internet connectivity but something to keep in mind (there is no status check to see if the command worked or not)."
1,I purchased it with a discounted price and now it seems pretty worthy and durable. Kindle's the best and most comfortable e-reader for my everyday use. I love it and put it in my bag everyday.
1,Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
0,"I know a lot of the ability of the Amazon Echo is more than I know...if there was a real tutorial available, this would probably be a great product."
1,"I love our Echo! It keeps getting better every day because Amazon keeps making it better, without fees."
1,"Love this lightweight easy to read Kindle. Carry it with me all the time especially to the beach and pool. So easy to see! My sister bought one the same week I did, she liked it so much."
1,Works as good as the original
1,Very easy to use and install I didn't have any problems with it
1,Was hesitate about buying the echo because of price. When it went on sale I said I had to have it. After realizing what it is and how to use it even if it wasn't on sale I would have ordered anyway.
1,Perfect tablet for the money and quality. I had to buy another as a Christmas gift
0,Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
0,"purchased to use as a reader. Was told that it had Play Store and after many attempts, we couldn't get it to work properly"
1,"Use for Amazon Prime video, Netflix, and DIRECTV Now. Would be 5 stars if remote controlled volume and tv power."
1,"Overall, very easy to install. I use stick on velcro to attach to back of TV to keep out of sight. Many apps available very clear picture and sound easily connected with one HDMI."
1,"Bought this as a gift for mother's day, after her several attempts to use lower quality tablets that died quickly. She likes the size for her hands. Convenient for her to carry and use. Quickly gets email and plays her games."
1,"Seriously a flawless, portable, smart, multipurpose gadget. Add this to the incredible Flash Sale price and I'd have been a fool to pass it up. Fast charge, balanced tuning, easy to pair and did I mention highly portable? The cradle is a sweet design too. The only beef I have is that YOUR BLUETOOTH IS PAIRED screaming at you when syncing. Own one of these-"
1,"Nice tablet. Love reading books on this, kid profile option is excellent"
1,"If you want a device that performs on command, Alexa is her name.She's a constant companion in the kitchen. She sings, tells jokes, shares recipes, tells stories, quotes Bible verses, gives me the weather forecast and so much more.If you add the additional devices you can control your lights or thermostat. My grandson really likes Alexa because she tells him stories.This inanimate object begins to feel like a real person the longer you have it around."
1,"My old Kindle finally wouldn't charge any more so I went to Best Buy to see if it could be fixed. Too bad! It couldn't! SOOOO, I got a new one that is amazing! And it is so user-friendly I figured out how to borrow books from the library all by myself! Couldn't be any more pleased."
1,Really love this. My only issue is that there are benefits to being an amazon music service member and I don't want another provider. Still great though with the other services that connect.
1,Bought the Fire for my son. Excellent product for the price.
1,This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
1,i really rely on this product . I watch movies and and lots of Tv Shows.i would really recommend this product to everyone.
1,"Easy setup, great sound, stylish, and fun to use!I'd love one for every room in my home!"
1,"I really like the Echo, but it does take a long while to set it up. Also, to utilize it fully, you have to sign up for premium services for music, etc."
1,"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
1,This is a very food tablet with its price. Very decent and affordable!0
0,I would say about 50% of the questions you ask are answered - far too much I do not know. You do not get that same level when yopu google something so not sure why the difference. I would hope there would be further upgrades you can download.
1,"It's only a few weeks old, but so far the TV is working great. Great picture. No issues to report."
0,Poor response. Very sluggish. Even the Amazon app is slow. Not so on my Apple or Droid tablets. I've yet to load any apps.
1,"I already have an Echo in the kitchen (which I love) and purchased the Echo dot for the family room to pair it via Bluetooth with a hybrid tube amp, primarily for listening to music through Prime. If you have a home audio set up and prime, and can do with the limitations associated with Prime music, the Echo dot is the way to go. It is fantastic, from an ease of use standpoint (and sound quality from the amp). Setting up multiple Echos is very simple, as is managing them through the Alexa app; and once you teach Alexa a new skill (via additional apps) the skills are applied across all Alexa devices in the home."
1,Good product for child. Who only need to read the books
1,"tried fire stick first ,to slow for me so i exchanged it for this fire tv .. i like it much better"
1,"Fun and easy to use, install app and navigation.Good quality technology."
1,I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE!
1,I like Alexa in white better than the black version. But it depends on your furniture.
0,"I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience."
0,I'm still learning how to use it. I like that it is small enough to put in my purse.
1,This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
1,"I love my firestick, but the box is so much better"
1,"awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone"
1,this fire was for my daughter for her birthday she loves it
1,links up with up local library. good to read in sunlight. can check web and emails. close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon.
1,"Perfect for me. Just the right size, light weight, and reads easy."
1,great speaker and very useful around the house. take advantage
1,Overall I think the Heart S3 in an excellent product. I am still learning how to make the most of it. I need reading glasses to read so if your like me you may want to consider that.
1,"Enjoying navigating Alexa, will have to add devices to get more things to enjoy- turn on lights, etc"
1,This is the third kindle i have purchased they ate easy to operate
1,Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
1,"I purchased one few months ago and this is my second one to put in another room, just ask the questions and get the answers , play music , or control other home connected devices . Very amazing."
1,Excellent value for money. Would recommend this to a friend.

1,purchased for my child to read - works as expected and for the price it was a good option
1,This item was purchased as a Christmas gift and the receiver loves it. They mostly play games and read books on it.

1,Very easy to setup and use I would definitely recommend this
1,But like a lil kid sometimes she/Alexa doesn't here me.
1,I bought this for my son. Some of his homework needs to be done online and the tablet worked perfectly for it. He could also use it at the zoo to take pictures and use it to play games.
1,Upgraded from the original Kindle not sure why we waited so long.
0,It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
1,This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap.
1,Wanted to upgrade my Kindle and this one is perfect.
1,"I bought an extra power cord for my Echo a month ago but it has been on backorder. Then when I went to check, it was not scheduled to ship for another few weeks. I then saw this one, and it is new. I placed an order for it and it was at my door in two days with Prime.I love my Echo and wish I could buy another at the introductory rate that I did a year ago. We use it daily in our household, mainly for news and listening to music while cooking in the kitchen. We wanted another one for the main bedroom for the alarm, weather, and music. Having poor eyesight, it is nice to ask Alexa what the weather is rather then trying to find my glasses in the dark. I bough the extra cord and plugged it into my nightstand. I now unplug the one in the kitchen and plug it into the bedroom. Within a minute it is back online.So much easier than buying two Echos. Feels solid and just like the first one, very pleased."
1,great product so good in fact I bought 4 of them. 3 as gifts and they love thiers too.
1,It was a great experience. I will be back in the future!!
1,Did what its suppose to do my kid loves it. Amazon keep up the great work
1,It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.
1,My grandson had an older Kendall and I bought him a new were one and he loves it and it's a wonderful device
1,"I've often said that everyone needs staff. Unfortunately, most of us can't afford to have someone at our beck and call. Well with the echo and Alexa you can and there's almost nothing it can't do. Well except for picking up the dry cleaning, but I suspect an Amazon drone will do that soon too."
1,"I'm just beginning to learn all the things one can do with this. So far it's great for general info, cooking, timer, games, music, weather, news, jokes...will be checking out accessories next......a household must have!"
1,I'm sorry I waited as long as I did to buy my Echo. I'm still learning all it can do but so far I've added some TP Link outlets and light switches for convenience.
1,"It is a fun device, easy to install,The sound is good and it fits anywhere, I would recommend it to a friend!"
1,Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version.
1,We love the Echo. Decent speaker and easy to take outside.
1,It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary
1,I mostly use this for reading books and its just awesome.. easy to carry and nice clarity..!! Worth the amount spent..!!
1,Item works well. Best choice for Cord Cutters. Wish I did this earlier...
1,Great media box and you can do so much with it. Really fast and has 4K!
1,"Initially I bought the Amazon echo to take it for a test drive. Just to see what all the hype was about. After about a week of playing with the device. I bought an Amazon echo for my bonus room, my living room, and my bedroom. I am simply amazed at what the Amazon echo can do. I am a lifetime Apple product supporter but this device here is simply the best I've seen so far. Pair the echo with a smartthings hub....then ask Alexa and its done."
1,We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.
1,Easy to use when traveling. Has all I need and is fast and covers my needs.

1,Great starter tablet takes great pics and the screen is a great size to start off with when first using a tablet
1,This is a great tablet. Great value . Great price. Good quality.
1,This feels flimsier than my 2 year old kindle fire but it does what it needs to for me--store books. I especially like the blue shade feature for night reading.
1,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
1,"Of all the kindle readers this is the best one.I love this, small, easy to read"
1,I realized after I bought this and tried to use it with a mobile hotspot that it requires WiFi to operate. I didn't return it because I'm moving to a place that has WiFi in a few days and will try to get it to work.
1,"Made this purchase for my daughter. She is used to iOS but was able to figure out the differences very quickly and had no issues. Its great to have a cheaper tablet for her movies and games, especially during road trips"
1,It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
1,"How magical is it that this Alexa knows the answers to all my questions? She never seems to offer anything outside of what is asked of her, and gives only a specific response to any query I pose. Awesome."
1,I love reading on these tablets. Its so easy to use too. I would like to say that this does not use andriod software but Fire OS
1,It's a great beginner tablet for kids allows you to ensure your kids are viewing and playing contents for their age.
1,"I'm thinking it gets smarter the more you use it. Provides good info on daily stuff; best route to work, traffic, etc. Not too good on follow up questions. Wife likes when it greats her when she gets home."
1,It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast..
1,"Works as intended. Speaker could perform better, but still give 5 stars as it's not designed to just be a speaker but a voice activated assistant, which it does very well."
1,"Bought this for my kids, the parental controls are awesome. The tab does everything it is supposed to very well, I even find myself using it after kids fall asleep. Would strongly recommend to any one looking on a budget."
0,its need amazon account for download any apps ............... ita really pain for me . i dont like it
1,"Good tablet, very good quality. The screen looks great. It is quick and easy to use. The only bad thing is the applications, it does not have YouTube is another similar application but it is very bad. But for the price it seems advisable and affordable."
1,I've never had a tablet before. Everything was easy to figure out battery lasts a long time
1,"It's a nice tablet for the price they are. Got the tablet for my kids and they like it, the only thing I don't like is the battery goes out pretty fast."
1,I bought two of these tablets one for each of my daughters for Christmas they're able to connect to social take pictures listen to music perfect reasonably priced tablet. wish I would have bought it for them sooner recommended it my sister and she bought for her kid also
1,I love this Fire TV. Much faster than the fire stick.

1,Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
1,"This tablet performs as well or better as any other tablet for a great price, no issues or complaints whatsoever!"
1,Spend the extra money and get this instead of the firestick. Way more responsive. The time saved scrolling the guide on PS VUE alon is worth it.
1,Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale.
1,I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card.
1,Great battery life. However it is slow to respond at times (finger sensitivity). Otherwise it's great for reading. Very useful.
1,This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
1,as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized.
1,"Perfect size, not to small or not to big. The built in light really helps. Great reader if just reading you are looking for."
1,The best e-reader that I have ever used. I would recommend it!
1,Who needs a radio when you got Alexa :) Great product
1,"Alexa is a fun product. We use it to set an alarm, play music and find out about traffic. Only downside so far is that it sometimes does not understand us especially if there is other surrounding noise. Also, the other products it can control are very expensive."
0,Pad 50 bucks for this tablet and have been happy with it used a an internet reader. Can play video with some lag and buffering
1,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy ."
1,"Exactly as advertised. Easy to read in the sun, no glare on the screen. GREAT battery life! I'm an avid reader and only have to charge once every few weeks. Love that the brightness is adjustable so I can read in bed after my husband has gone to sleep without bothering him. No strain on your eyes without a light on."
1,"I kept waiting for a good deal since this new 300ppi kindle released. There's no discount from Amazon. However, I received student coupon from Bestbuy with $20 discount. That was an amazing deal! Now I start to read the song of ice and fire with my new kindle!"
1,"Bought this kindle for myself, can't wait to open it."
1,Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet.
1,Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
1,Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price.
1,Did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value.
1,We got this back in January for our apartment and actually use it on a daily basis. Mostly for playing music but can't wait to move into a house so we can use more of the integrated home features. Sound is actually really great! Very good quality speaker.
1,My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn't want to put it down.
1,I do a lot of reading and it's just right for that
1,Price was reasonable and it is easy to use. It is just the right size for traveling.
1,"I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy."
1,"My daugther used to have a leap frog tablet, but when it started to have battery issues I went to the store and found out that they no longer produced the tablet, so best buy gave me store credit and they recomended me this tablet. My daugther loves it and so do I. On kidz mode I can rest assured that she is only going to see kids safe content like interactive book, games and apps. On tablet mode she can watch movies with the SD card slot which can go all they way to 128GB!I put a 32 GB which help us on our loooong christmas trip..."
