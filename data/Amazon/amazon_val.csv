1,Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages.
1,"This Fire TV does everything that I need it to and more. It's stable and never have any issues. Ever since I got it, I use it daily."
1,I bought this because reading on my iPad started hurting my eyes. This is awesome. Love it!
1,I bought a total of 7 of these and the kids love them! Caught them on Black Friday for $34.99...best money I spent!
1,Bought for a friend with basic needs. Money was not a concern at all!
1,Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
0,I didn't know much about the device before buying other than the fun commercials. I figured that it was internet connected and could do anything I asked it to. I quickly learned this is not the case. You aren't able to just plug it in and expect it to know everything on the internet. It seemed it didn't know know some basic questions. It uses skills where are like phone APs. You have to enable each skill in order to use it. When you want to use a skill much like an ap you have to remember the specific skill and then Include that in what you ask it to do. It seems like it does home automation well and basic functions but it has a long way to go before it's a know everything on the internet
0,"We bought this Kindle Fire for our autistic grandson. He seemed to fight with it trying to connect to the internet. After 3 adults tried and tried to connect it to the internet, it finally connected. Every time he comes to our house, we have to fight again to get it connected. We decided this was not the unit for him or any other kid. So, its back to the mini I-Pad."
1,"Kindle Whitepaper Reader is a replacement for my original Kindle. I like the fact that the Whitepaper has a back light so you can easily read in low light situations. Also, the non glare screen makes it so easy to read in bright sunlight."
1,I would say more but I'm still learning to use it.
1,There are others streaming devices but they seem to lacking storage or memory
1,"My wife previously had a nook that sadly broke due to an untimely drop. We purchased the paperwhite and she can't say enough positive things about it. She loves how quickly it connect with an author and the other books they've written. The light doesn't keep her up all night, but she can read without having to have all the lights on so at least I can get some rest. We highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite."
1,"I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase."
1,I'd been using my phone as my e-reader but have wanted to get a stand-alone reader for a while. The screen on this is amazing and the light is a great addition. If you're on the fence- go for it.
1,Good products
1,I got this strictly for the eReader capability and since I have Amazon Prime it's great for getting lots of ebooks at great prices. It's lightweight and easy to use.
1,I am enjoying the many capabilities this product offers!
1,First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
1,Alexa is so simple to set up and so fun to use. We love it and use it all of the time. We keep it in the kitchen so it's easily accessible.
1,This solved the problem of my daughter's lost kindle charger.
1,Great item if you would want to control your electronic devices without lifting an arm. Great volume! Great item overall.

1,It is easy and fun to use. This was a gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. She can play on it for hours.
1,Bought a 7' kindle on Black Friday for $34.00. What a great price for a great gift..
0,The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.
1,"Good Amazon product , good camera and amazing apps"
1,this was one of the best product i could have bought for my daughter
1,This is a solid tablet that does everything you would want from a portable device to do
1,Great product easy to set up and understand. Highly recomended
1,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.
1,"Bought it for my granddaughter. She had an older Kendal which she gave to her younger brother but not a Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet. She loves it."
1,Does what it is supposed to do!
1,Bought this for Christmas exchange. Very cheap because I used reward points. No complaints yet.

1,Thank..............................................
1,"I love the Amazon Echo. It's able to do so many things. I have started a smart home and it can control switches, lights, thermostat and much more. The speaker on the Echo is great. She can answer your questions, set alarms and kitchen timers, dim lights and play your favorite music."
1,It really is amazing that it not only answers your questions but also can find and play your favorite music!
1,I have bought 8 of these. They are perfect for kids
1,This is the second one I bought and been happy with this purchase. Has everything that Apple has and you can do a lot more with this one.
1,The fire tv box is the best and fastest steaming player out in the market. Have 4 devices in my house and got rid of my direct tv subscription. It's the best.
1,"Great reader for the price. Compact, lightweight, print and back ground lighting can be adjusted for easier reading. Some people may find this helpful if they have vision problems"
1,I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks
1,Got this the another day for my niece and she loves everything it has to offer
1,Was a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter she just loved it one of her favorite item she plays with. It goes with her almost everywhere
1,Great price. Easy start up easy to use.. large memory Great product
1,my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
1,"Great product. Very easy to set up and reliable. Voice recognition is almost perfect and very fast. It provides very useful features already with its native services. and it can be further improved with additional skills.It's a perfect device if you have it linked to some smart-home device, as it provides a centralized and integrated home-management platform.I have not had the change to compare it to other similar devices, like Google Home. Anyway, given the reviews and the quality of the device, and the huge amount of options to expand it via additional devices, like echo dot, echo show and other gadgets, as well as the additional skills, I would certainly recommend it."
1,I really think it's awesome that it controls light thermostat and such I haven't bought any of these items yet but overall it's very helpful it's a nice tool to have at home it's hands-free you can ask questions overall I'm very satisfied with it
1,Very happy with the product. Very simple to set up. Easy on eyes. Great option when you are on the road.
1,Wonder product! Really enjoying it setup was easy and the sound is wonderfully loud
1,"awesome tablet , great price, everything i wa hoping it would be"
0,"Was looking for a low-priced tablet to access my Kindle and magazine apps - specifically The Economist. What I didn't realize was that this was the ad-version of the Kindle, so removing ads on it would not be possible w/o fee - and worse, there's some limitation around some apps and everything located in the Google Play store, so apps like The Economist were not available. Sooooo... returned."
1,i gave the Amazon echo as a gift to my children for the holidays and from what I understand they are all loving it.
1,"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me."
1,This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.
1,"First Amazon Fire tablet, previously had a first gen kindle, love this tablet and cannot beat the price $35!Working wonderfully -"
1,Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
1,"This is the second fire tablet I've purchased. I got this one for my son for his birthday and I have one for myself. For the price, there simply isn't a better option!"
1,"This Paperwhite (back-lit) Kindle is wonderful. No more Itty-bitty book light needed! Just turn on and read, even at night. And there is no glow during the daylight. In addition, I took it to the beach and read it there..no glare unlike the iPad. I had one of the early Kindles, so maneurving around the menu is different but easy to learn and get use to."
1,No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.
1,"Amazon Echo does a lot of things. Keeps todo and shopping lists for you. Plays music just by asking. Keeps your schedule (using Google Calendar), has some great games, including trivia games. I would buy it again in a second."
1,"bought this as a gift so i can't speak on how it functions. however, i researched all kinds of tablets online before purchasing this and it was a great deal"
1,This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.
1,I love the Echo but I hate the fact that it doesn't have a rechargeable battery. I would really be convenient if I could take it on the beach or out to a park without having to worry about having a power source with me. Other than that it's great.
1,Very good product and easy to set up. I've used it everyday and enjoy it!
1,Love being able to tell what I need on my shopping list
1,"Alexa is fantastic, she is helpful, excellent voice recognition, it can help with many tasks. My home is smart because of Alexa. I recommended this product."
1,"fits my needs, love to read and it just fits my hands and is great and easy to read"
1,I now have. 5 of these. You need to get one asap. I'm a huge fan of the slingbox app and the prime features.
1,bright screen which makes reading it day or night easy
1,This by far is one of the greatest tablets out there for kids. Cost is affordable and there is a lot for them to do. Keeps my 8 year old busy in drs offices. Lightweight and easy to use.
1,Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .
1,Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
1,This is our seventh Kindle purchased! Love them all! Price was fantastic too!
1,the product is working perfectly and the service was greatThank you
1,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law, it was just what she wanted, didn't want lots of extras . Good light to view & read with."
1,"She works well if you know exactly what to say. :/ if you say something that is not precise for the action you want, she will not understand. She is smart, and useful, but she still has a few kinks to work out."
1,Love it. Going to go back and get a couple of more for the rest of my tvs
1,I bought this tablet as a secondary one and I'm happy with the ease of use and fairly quick internet usage. You can't beat the price for what it gives you and it's also feels sturdy when holding it.
1,"Was on the fence since I didn't have any other smart products, but glad I took the plunge. Not having an amazon music account only limits what you can have Alexa play, but between the apps and directly connecting to phones, you really don't need it."
1,Works well for what it is intended for.
1,Something the family always wanted. Got it as a gift for my wife. Works good. But occasionally pick up conversations. Not to thrilled about that.
1,i can't get it to work with my home automation like Harmony Remote
1,"This paperwhite is great for reading anywhere ! Outside, at night ! It small lightweight and i just love it !"
1,"Our new Amazon Echo was very easy to set up! Alexa has a great voice and can perform countless tasks, we love ""her""."
1,I really do use my Amazon ECHO for all my alarm needs. I also do some cooking which needs a reminder when things are done or need to be added for the receipt.
1,My grandson loves his Christmas gift and has not put it down yet. I will buy another for the other grandchildren.
1,My kids really enjoyed this tablet. Its kid friendly...
0,Navigates easily. Many channels. Fast connection speeds.
1,"I got this as a gift, and it was a big hit! Very easy to use, and kid friendly too"
1,Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother. I already owned a Kindle Paperwhite and knew that it would be perfect for her. It is lightweight and easy to hold; lit from behind so no glare (easy on the eyes); and the font size can be easily adjusted. A charge lasts for a week or more. With a Kindle you can carry an entire library of books with you. The Paperwhite easily slips into a purse or large coat pocket, so you are never without a book whether you are traveling or waiting for someone. I was right about my mom; she was thrilled to receive her Kindle, and at 86 she is excited about using new technnology."
1,"Love the Amazon Fire. 4K quality, the remote ,and the ability to use it while traveling put this over the top. Plus it's less expensive than the Roku and Apple TV."
1,Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
1,Great Deal for An Entry Amazon tablet. Unbeatable entry level tablet for use in the Amazon eco system.
1,Size makes tablet easy to take with but still large enough to be easy to see.
1,Grandson is enjoying this tablet very much lots of learning games to teach him plus having fun too.
1,"i love the box better than the stick. For one i love that you can directly connect with an ethernet cord, usking the ultimate speeds, and that is has the android os which you can play with to get some of the best programs out there."
1,We love it kids n all everyday use for us we don't use cable as much ch as b4
1,"If you are considering picking up an Echo I would also consider picking some Hue Lightbulbs so you can control your light with your voice. I would also suggest using IFTTT to get the most out of your echo, especially if you have other smart devices currently being used in your home. Couldn't be happier with my Echo :)"
1,Hope to use it a lot in the future. I like all the apps and music. Hard to connect with other household devices
1,Very easy to set up....I have other android tv boxes and this is by far one of the best.
1,Love it best purchase especially if you have someone to program it for you!
1,This is an awesome tablet for the price. Kindle got it right.
1,Its worth to buy this table for the price. elegant design and response. feel better than samsung tab
1,Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
1,"It's small but gets the job done, I love it cause it fits right in my purse. It holds a charge for days when not in use"
1,The products were great. I was able to access the books that I had been craving for.
1,"Purchased as a gift for my mother in law, she loved it!"
1,"I got this tablet for my son witch it works great for him, It does have some issues but nothing I can live with. It like to disconnect ftom the internet once in awhile and sometime you have to rest it to make youtube work, But overall for the price you can't complain great buy..."
1,"My husband set the Kindle for our grandson and he just loves it. Now he can read every day as well as play games, also he watches videos."
0,My hubby bought this for me since I was constantly googling questions on my phone. I was so excited to start asking it questions..... the only problem is Alexa doesn't have any of the answers. Music sounds great on it but that's about it. Not impressed. Save your money.
1,No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
1,The Kindle Fire has been my granddaughter favorite
1,The reader does the job. Easy to use and easy to read.
1,Easy for my kid to use and navigate through. Fun for adults too.
1,It's a great alternative to cable and satellite tv...
1,We are very happy with this tablet the ability to expand the memory is awesome
1,Love this thing. It's very useful and a lot of fun to have!
1,Have an original kindle but need a new one and can use this outside
1,Love the amazon fire tv. So easy to use! Couldn't be happier with my purchase.
1,I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"Bought Amazon Fire TV 2/16/15, this is NOT the replacement cord for my model.Be aware of what you are purchasing --- this is NOT a fit for the older Fire models.Alternate, non Amazon, power cords are available for the older version of Fire TV on Amazon."
1,"As inexpensive as this tablet is, it is a great option for children. Each of my kids has one. If they damage it, you aren't out a ton of money like an iPad. Freetime is also a great option to help control apps and time each child is on the kindle."
1,"I was looking for entertainment in my man-cave without a lot of complicated wiring. The Fire TV is for me!! I just plugged it into my television, setup my wifi and that was it. It took me no time at all before I was enjoying high quality movies in my man-cave!! I highly recommend this product!!"
1,The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don't leave home without it.
1,Yeah!!!! I like it... Very convenient to use... The quality was excellent too...
1,"I purchased this tablet about a month ago, have enjoyed it every since! I would truthfully say it is one of the best."
1,"I've had Kindles before, but they always lacked something that made them practical. One didn't have touch, another didn't have a light, etc. I decided after years of not having one to give a kindle another chance. This one is perfect!! It's lite, it's relatively fast, the back light works great, it's easy to read, etc. I've read 5 times as many books on it than I had on all the other combined. Best purchase I've made in years."
1,My wife and I really enjoy the Echo. We use it to stream music and the daily news feed as well as turn on some lights. The sound is very good and fills the room(s) we have it in and near.
1,My only complaint is that the charger does not fit in snugly to the device and I have replaced several devices as I could not get it to charge. They should take a look at Apple products and how they are constructed.
1,The amazon echo comes in very handy around the house for myself and the grand kids its and excellent device to have around for questions alarms music also weather
1,"Bought it for my mom for Mother's Day. She loves it. Used it for music, weather, and just in case she can't get to the phone, Alexa can send a text to us."
1,I have purchases 2 of the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black.
1,"Great price. Purchased for kiddos and seems hard to figure out, no instructions but company emailed me offering help to learn about new gadget from geek squad. Definitely great free apps program with tons of options!"
1,Excellent streaming box - Easy to setup & Use! Performs great either hard wired or running on Wi-Fi. There are both free apps and paid apps to help save on cable costs! Works perfect with your Amazon Prime membership! Would totally recommend!
0,Had to return TWO tablets b/c they had dead pixels. Third was fine!
1,"Although I really like having a physical book to hold onto, I really like being able to travel with this and not have the bulk of several real books. It also make borrowing books from my local library really easy."
1,"Purchased for 8 yr old daughter. It's easy for her to use and allows me to set time limits on her game, internet and streaming."
1,Very useful and fun to use.I bought 2 for the beach house
1,"I looked at several brands and read reviews of tablets before making my purchase and the Amazon Fire was by far the best. I purchased mine from Best Buy and they had a great price, less than $50!! I highly recommend this product, it has plenty of room for games, books or just to search the web. I love it!!"
0,This is a cheap tablet. I bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another IPad by crushing it. This tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. If it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.
0,"I have Alexa now 5 months running.You would expect, that Alexa can anwser many, many questions. It can (maybe), but you have to know which App has the answer, you have to install the app and you have every time to say a special commands . Stupid. Alexa is out of the box very stupid. And after investing hours - she is not much more knowledgeable. It's a stupid AI."
1,"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem."
1,The amazon echo definitely meets expectations! Easy and fun to use!
1,"Best purchase ever, such a small item that delivers big results."
1,Love this kindle fire. Awesome product for an incredible price.
1,Awesome because I can simple just shop whatever I want just by calling her. Does the job right.
1,Enjoy listening to music and asking to research items.
1,I would recommend this product to almost anyone. It's small and user friendly. The installation was easy and hassle free
1,"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network"
1,"I ordered this power charger at the same time I ordered my new E Reader. It works great, very fast. I was disappointed that it was an add on and not included with the price of the reader."
0,"Although the description states that this will work on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, when I plug the charger to the Kindle, I receive a message that the charger is not of sufficient wattage to properly charge the Kindle. I bought this charger as a back up for when I travel. The original charger which came with the Kindle does not show this warning when I plug it in."
1,Alexa turns on my Phillips Hue lightning; plays my radio stations' keeps my grocery lists' acts as a timer; answers questions; tells me the weather forecast . Still learning her capabilities. Also purchased an Echo Dot for my upstairs. Love them
1,"Works good, quality for videos aren't that great but it's good for surfacing the web, games, books ect."
1,"I first bought the echo dot and loved it but the sound is lacking. I bought this for the living room and it sounds 100x better. It's not going to blow the windows out or anything but for what I use it for it is perfect. Alexa, you're awesome."
1,My Alexa Echo is so fun and very easy to use. I love asking her questions and having herPlay my favorite tunes.
1,Love this tablet. Has all the best features of a kindle and a regular tablet. It is easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to do with zero fuss.
1,"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
1,"I loved it. Not only was the price good, but 8gb of memory is phenomenal!"
1,Have now had for a month and I have to say the speed of this tablet is good. Really no lag on browsing. Only major downfall that some games might lag a bit. But for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple its price will do.
1,Tablet has good response time and multi tasking is seamless as well! Good vivid colors!
1,This is a great streaming product. Especially if you already have Amazon Prime.
1,At 50$ this is an absolute steal deal for any one who wants to have a tab to watch movies on the go and carry music and small games.Good for kids and travellers
1,This is amazing can easily move it from computer to TV. My kids love watching movies. Set up in seconds and ready to go.
1,Great for travel. It is very loud for its size. Over all I love it.
1,I love my fire.It's a little smaller than I.m used to
1,Item works excellent replaced my apple tv with this unit.
1,I love it and I brought two more for my Grandson and God Daughter.
1,The product is great. The fact is there are so many things that opened up to use the unit with.
1,It worked perfectly!!
1,"Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great."
1,We don't have cable tv so this is a great way to get to see shows and rent movies
1,I purchased the Amazon Fire because you can get the PS Vue app. The system is easy to use and the picture quality is great.
1,I purchased this for my children (ages 2 to 10) and they all love it and use it with ease.
1,we love our amazon firetv box it does so much for such a nice price
1,I wouls recommend this over your phone or pc display anyday of the week. Great for your eyes. Doesnt weight anything. Finished reading the gunslinger on this.
1,Kindle Fire image are very clear and very helpful my kid love it I definitely recommend to buy it
1,We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.
1,The echo has great sound and is remarkably intelligent. Great to get it on sale too!
1,Bought for my mother in law and she hasn't had any issues with it. Runs her games and internet browser fine.
0,My daughter preferred the ipad. The apps are a little complicated for her age she is 2.
1,"I bought two of these, one for each of my granddaughters. They absolutely love them."
1,Used to older format takes getting used to but good overall
1,"An improvement upon the earlier versions, plus the newer, enhanced text. Makes for a great reading experience!"
0,I was excited to get this because of the price. After taking it home I started noticing things that bothered me. I use samsung devices and the amazon app store does not have a lot of the same apps. Even chrome would not work on this device. I did return this because I was looking for more than a bare stock tablet. But if that's what your looking for its great!
1,"gave it to my husband for xmas...n he loves it...he uses it everyday gets the weather info, time, setup his alarm, plays music...ect...comes on handy when you are in a rush just ask ALEXA...."
1,this is better than having Dish network or Direct TV program in what you need and there it is.
1,This is a great tablet good size and very easy to use.
1,"Good basic tablet for checking email , web browsing , and reading ebooks."
1,"Already own 2 Roku's. Purchased 2 Fire TV's and found the performance and usability very good. Replaced Cable TV withe them parred with PlayStation Vue Core Slim. The menu system/DVR is as good if not better than Cable. Mix that with a Tivo interface and Netflix, it is a game changer."
1,Saw this on TV decided to look into it purchased it and loved it
0,"The tablet is nice but the internet source takes forever to load so it is just easier to use a standard computer or phone to surf the web or get on Facebook, etc."
1,This e-reader fits very nicely into my library of other electronic devices. It works great.
1,Easy to connect and use!Greats apps Great product Get it!
1,my grandkids love it. This is the 3 one we bought.
1,The Kindle Fire will not disappoint - durable and easy to use. We have 4 kids using them all tied to the same amazon account. So convenient!
1,My wife loves it and won't let me use it. I may just have to go get my own!
1,"Great assistant. Can handle the lights, music and questions"
1,Worked as good as I was hoping. Easy to use and uploads fast
1,Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
1,Great tablet for the price! Very satisfied with the quality of tablet!
1,Just love this tablet.does everything teenage grandson needs it to do! I also buy one for my granddaughter!
1,"Please don't let the cheap price of this tablet fool you. I can do a lot with it: surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games, etc. There's an issue with the volume of Amazon Fire 7 (not quite loud enough for me even when I turn the volume to its max). But I think I still did a great decision to buy it. Good product overall."
1,"Excellent e-reader, with great download ability. I really do not need the 3G as most of my downloads are through my PC."
1,I bought this after speaking with a sales rep in Tigertown. I bought this for my kid and he loves it. Its my 2nd kindle.
1,My kids liked it very much.It is a good worth tab.
1,While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
1,This is a great tablet at a great price! It was easy to set up.
1,The paperwhite is very similar to a real book. The light setting is helpful and eyes friendly. One battery charge can last long.
1,Great product!! It was easy enough for my ten year old to use. Also it was easy to set it up for her. I highly recommend it for the price!!!
1,"If you are using with compatible smart devices in your home (e.g. we use with Phillips Hue bulbs) Echo is great. We do get a bit frustrated with the search capabilities .... I suspect Google home is better at web search. Much of the time we ask a question, Alexa says she doesn't understand the question. Search is pretty limited to Wikipedia. there are many skills you can enable, and some of them are fun/helpful, but then you have to remember what to say to use the skill. I think this will be even more useful as we add smart devices to our home."
1,"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot."
1,"This is a great e-reader, perhaps a little pricey but well worth the money. It is extremely light and the e-ink is very readable."
1,I love this box I cut my cable and now use sling tv and am saving a ton
1,"So, at first, I wasn't sold on this. I bought it mainly to act as voice control for my Lutron lights on our first floor and I already had Pico remotes throughout, so it didn't get used that much. Then, it kind of clicked with some simple things like setting timers and playing podcast. Then, it got more natural when I connected the Alexa app and the Logitech Harmony app with IFTTT. Next thing you know, my wife and my son are both using it as we're coming and going to turn the lights off and on, turning on the TV, turning off when it's time for dinner etc etc. Really excited for the upcoming Sonos integration... All in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase as it's become a really strong platform for home automation and it only looks like it's going to get better.I think it's safe to say that the Echo means different things to different people... if you're into HA, then don't hesitate!"
1,Have had other products similar for the kids but this is the best by far. Best Buy had a great price too so decided to try it. Love it.
0,I think the cord needs to be a bit longer. This would enable you to read while charging.
1,Bought for my 5 & 7 year olds. They love them. Easy to use. Highly recommend.
1,I wanted an e-reader that will read manga well and this did not disappoint!
1,This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
1,Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do.
0,Not a bad basic tablet but is slow when loading apps
1,"My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!"
1,This Kindle has a decent screen and image quality. The feature I miss most is the lack of capability of this tablet to automatically shut down when you close the case - but understandable at the price point.
1,"This is an accessible tablet and easy to use, great for kinds and granma"
1,"This is my first electronic reading device. I was one of those people saying I like the paper book in my hands. However the convenience, especially when traveling, is an understatement."
1,It doesn't work good and it is very slow and that ability is not a good working tablet I would not recommend it
1,"I def enjoy the voice assistant from Amazon. I can control lights, TV, and audio. Plus Alexa keeps up with any questions I have. Plus she is a good sport even if you insult her."
1,Love it. Sound is decent. Not the best lows but with all the features it's not a big deal. I can do a lot of things with this little speaker. Will be buying more for other rooms.
1,Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.
1,Not much negative to say other than I don't like how you buy an Amazon card to put on the tablet and yet they still require a credit card.
1,"Great device to have also inexpensive, I brought 5 of these. Get one."
1,"Between my wife and I we have three apple I-pads. I purchased the fire tablet for myself and one for my daughter. It is an entertainment device. You can serf, email, watch movies on line and it makes an awesome remote for my Fire TV. It really pays off if you are an Amazon prime member. It has a version of the Amazon echo- but not quite as the echo or echo dot. I love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage. Perhaps they can teach this process to apple. After using this I have to admit that I have purchased my last IPad."
1,Absolutely love this product. Best decision we've made for entertainment.
1,family member has one and has it connected to all things in the house and i loved it
1,Very easy to use and has a bunch of great features. The voice remote and app make it even better.
1,This product is well worth the price... don't waste money on a screen protector or case... when it gets beat up get a new for another $50.Great for kids who want to play games on theIr parents wireless telephone...nice to get my telephone back. Also slips nicely in the seat pocket of cars for the car rides.
1,It works great for all like to surf on the internet.
1,Does the job for a 50 dollar tablet. I used it to watch movies and music. Worked great for that. Get it!
1,There are tons of apps and everyone can watch what they want. with the micro SD card you never run out of space. in my opinion is better than the Apple tv. I have both.
1,The fire stick makes getting movies at home a breeze. Most movies can be seen in HD format from your living room.
1,Not only fun but very informative in all sorts of areas
1,I use it every day. 4k shows like the Grand Tour look impressive. Set up is easy.
1,If u r an amazon customer the fire is a great tablet to shop on
1,"Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands."
1,"good for android and very fast, good for gaming and streaming"
1,What can I say? The Amazon Fire is a great tablet . The price is fantastic . Good size . Does the job . Great deal at Best Buy
1,"I am still learning how to using it. I use it for Facebook, e-mails,play games on Facebook, eventually I want to be able to use the camera which I haven' t figured out yet. Once do I will be doing a lot of picture taking!"
1,"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
1,I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.
1,This is a smooth product. works very well; still have the iPad over it but for the price you can't beat it .
1,I got this to put kodi on and stream 4K stuff. Works great
1,My son received this as a gift and he enjoys it. It is used for playing games and watching YouTube videos. Great buy for cost.
1,"Alexa is a lot of fun! I use it every morning to get the news, and to listen to music."
0,Picture quality is not good. I don't like this product
1,"My sis will never be detached from her fire, she is truly hooked on it."
0,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
1,I bought this tablet for my kids to watch videos and use mostly educational games on it and they love it.
1,Got this for 40 bucks my daughter loves it .finally I get my phone back
1,I like set the font on large so I can read without my reading glasses. I can read at night without turning on the light.
1,It's an excellent product but will occasionally misunderstand what seem to be clear commands. Know what you want to say to it before you do so... it doesn't like pauses in speech. It seems to integrate well with compatible devices... and I love being able to use it to adjust my room temperature and lighting from bed.
1,Bought Alexa for my father in law for Christmas in which he loved!
1,Easy set up / good sound quality / loads of fun to play with
1,This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.
1,Easy to set up and operate. Convenient to operate over using my smart phone. Very quick response.
1,"My kids say this tablet is great for their needs. The camera is poor, but not a big deal since they had no intention of using the tablet as a camera."
1,"Quick, good color, holds a charge, somewhat light weight, can slip out of your hands easy."
1,"Easy to set up. LOTS of free tv with this. If you're an occasional TV watcher and pay for cable or Sat service, you just be able to ditch them and put the $ towards something else."
1,I have the stick also much better than the stick one...
1,Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
0,"The system is a little slow and then if you get the one with the offers, they slow down your reading a bit. But, you can't beat the price. This is not a full tablet. It' an E-Reader with a lot of enhanced functions."
1,Upgraded from first generation kindle. Works better than expected
1,The Echo is easy to use and lots of fun. I even bought one for my parents. They love it too.
1,Friend recommended this product. Mainly use for music but controls my tv and fios.
1,Fire TV is a better option than the stick if you are either needing a wired Ethernet connection ( that's the fastest) or installing third party software like Kodi. The extra memory makes the menus much faster than the stick. It's an awesome product.
1,Purchased for my granddaughters. They both loved it. I also purchased light starter kit so they can turn their light on in their bedroom using Alexa.
1,Love it whould tell everyone to get one buy it you will have tons of hours to do things.
1,"Lightweight, good screen quality. A bit slow but a good purchase"
1,I'm really happy that I purchased this Amazon Fire TV Box. It works great and so easy to use. Definitely worth the price!
0,I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....
0,Alexa did not powerful as Siri of Apple. It can not play YouTube. It is very limit to play music. It is required to open some accounts to play music.
1,"This new Kindle is wonderful!! I am able to read books anywhere, and also connect to the Internet."
1,Bought this for my mother to replace older RCA tablet and this one is so much better! She loves it!
1,Great for checking my emails and watching Netflix.
1,I love that I combines a tablet and a reader!! I don't need to bring two products around! Tough to beat at a $49 price
1,Old kindle broke. I love the improvements of the paperwhite. It is all touch screen. The old was not.
1,"Bought the Echo originally in black, but had to exchange it due to unresponsiveness. I think I got a dud, but changed it out for the new white Echo and it works great. Must have for AMZ Prime members since you can get prime only Alexa deals, play AMZ prime music library free, and use it to turn on/off lights (using WeMo)."
1,bought this product online and less than an hour i was able to pick the product in store. super love it!
1,"Really enjoying my product. Clear pictures, great sound quality"
1,Got this for my husband on Amazon and then got two more for grandkids at Christmas from Best Buy. They had a great Black Friday deal on them.
1,"This is the best device of the season.This is Siri on steroids Alexia does a lot.Apple could take a lesson from Amazon on this, but Apple will just steal the idea and call it innovating."
1,Amazon fire TV is so easy to use and its a great way to watch everything you want
1,My 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. He's had it for several months. The only negative I see is the charge port is starting to get loose. The small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.
1,"Great product no complaints, spend a little extra on good internet and never worry about cable."
1,New to Kindle. Always read a book in paperback or hardcover.User friendly. Will never go back to reading books on hardcover orpaperback... Extremely happy with the purchase.
1,"This kindle was very good and I enjoyed it a lot, i love it."
1,"I loved my tablet, it fits in my needs. It's fast and works perfectly for me."
1,This tablet is perfect for a parent who wants to monitor what their children are doing. As well as being able to control what their kids can and can not do on the internet.
1,"This is the perfect option for me. I can have more than one book at my disposal, yet it's lightweight and easy to carry. The print is easy on the eyes, too.."
1,"I got myself the newest, big Kindle Fire, though my old one still works. Got this for the grandkids, and they LOVE it too."
1,Used the fire sticksBut the upgrade in the box from the stick is amazing Would still recommend stick for starter
1,Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there's no separate profiles yet.
1,It's easy to operate pluse is good price range. It's great for teens.
1,I'm really enjoying this device. It lets you cut the cable cord.
1,I had the original kindle which I loved but it was a pain to always have to have it lit when reading without proper light. It is great to have the screen backlit without the eyestrain that comes with a tablet.
1,"Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
1,"As a retiree, I need to reduce expenses. DirecTv is way too expensive so I plan on watching more movies and TV shows through my Amazon Fire TV."
1,This is a great first tablet for kids. Lots of game and the battery life is good!
1,"lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!"
0,Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.
1,Great device! Connects quickly and easy to set up.
0,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
1,So far so good. Works well. Only been using for about two weekswith no problems
1,This is a great tablet for ages 5 and up. My son can watch videos play games. Its perfect for him.
1,Fire tv works great and user friendly. Great for watching movies
1,"Wonderful inexpensive tablet, for the novice or experienced person!"
1,"This is a great tablet for the money. I got it on black friday and am so glad I did get a few of them for the entire family. The biggest thing that sold me on this is that I am able to use parental controls and not worry about what my little kids are watching, reading, or playing. Go buy it for the family, you won't regret it!"
1,Excellent priced portable tablet good for carrying around. Very light and small.
1,"We go this for PlayStation vue. But with prime, there are so many options."
0,"iPad without the bells and whistles. The parental controls are good, but a bit confusing. Haven't had the time to sit down and sort it out"
1,I do like the kindle for reading at the beach and it is very portable.
1,I really appreciate the new design and features of the new Kindle Paperwhite. It makes spending time reading time well spent. Comfortable in your hand and easy on your eyes. Very enjoyable!
1,"The fire isn't going to thrill you like the iPad or surface, but it gets the job done. If you use Amazon video, HBO go, Netflix or any streaming device then it's a no brainer."
1,"Bought it on sale, couldn't ask for more for such a great product and price!"
1,bought 2 for our granddaughters (7 and 9) and they worked fine however the connection to the charger wore out after a couple of months and are no longer able to be charged. I would recommend adult supervision when connecting the charger for a child.
0,"I love it, but the first one I bought didn't work. When I got a working model I was very happy. Super cool technology"
1,Gave as a gift and the individual was excited. I would recommend this for anyone interested in having Wi-Fi.
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!! One thing I dont like is the charger doesnt stay in well. Its ok because I just rig it up and leave it on the charger over night. Only other complaint would be she can't download same games as her brothers tablet. Other than that absolutely great buy for $49.
1,easy on the eyes and perfect for travel. battery life is a +
1,"You can quickly amplify the voice of a lecture or turn it up for a party. Not only that, you can set alarms for naps with your voice and no longer have to worry whether your alarm is on."
1,He loves his kindle takes it everywhere. does school work on it plus plays games Excellent piece of equipment.
1,"I got 4 of these tablets, one for each of the kids, and they LOVE them! I love that I can set time limits on it and that I could set it up that they have to read for 30 min before they can play on them. I also like that there are a ton of apps and books that are free."
1,"I was a hesitant buyer of these devices until the echo dot was given to us as a gift. It is fun to use, but we wanted a louder and better speaker. So that's why we bought this. Happy so far."
0,Very good tablet camera not very good poor resolution
1,"I got tired of lugging my laptop around everywhere. I asked my daughter-in-law how she like her tablet. She loves it.So, I decided to get me one, especially since my kindle didn'thave a light, where I could read my books. I'm still figuring out,how to use it."
1,Plays everything we ask. Alexa knows all the music we ask.
1,It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
1,It works great for a kids tablet and the best is that you could add extra memory to it by adding a SD card.
1,"It may not be a speed demon, but this tablet runs very well and the Fire OS is easy to navigate and use. I'm taking off one star due to some annoying limitations like the fact that the OS makes you use its own browser at all times, but overall it's a smart buy if you want to test a tablet out!"
1,I really am enjoying my kindle. Im glad I got rhis one.
1,Got this for my mom so she can listen 2 music. Was simple to use.
1,We received one as a gift for Christmas love it so much we bought one for our parents.
1,Best purchase ever. Would recommend to anyone. It's the best
1,"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
1,Excellent tablet great for reading.This tablet is also good 4 games but could use longer battery life
1,Exactly what I orederd a great product I have ordered 3 of these from Best Buy.
1,I like everything about this product I bought for daughter and she loves it
1,My kids love it.they always come home and run to it .they on it into it's bed time
1,For the money this is most likely the best tablet available. This $49 tablet will do everything my Samsung Galaxy 4 will do. I wish Amazon had this available before I purchased the Samsung. I would highly recommend this tablet.
1,"I love the box, lots of features, can use on any tv home and vacation.."
1,"I love this thing and bring it with me everywhere. My only problem is the backlight, hear me out I suggest this if your a serious reader. The problem is that reading a glowing page is off putting and one of the reasons I bought a paper white 3. Becuase I can't read on a iPad for but maybe 20 mins. But its not that bad I usually just turn it off becuase most of my reading is done in daylight. All in all great but not perfect. And if your into occult reads like I am be ready to fork out the $$$ for them. The selection does leave some to be desired but not bad. I give the kindle store for books a 3 out of 5. If your not a serious reader(3+ books a week imo) I I would go with a voyage or if you can stick to the iPad I would do that."
1,Easy to use and setup. Good features and apps are easy to download.
1,This tablet works great for the price. This is my backup tablet for traveling since at the price is easy to replace
1,Great speaker- get Amazon and Spotify music anytime. Traffic and weather. Tells stories and jokes too!
1,"Great device for streaming movies! Works great, very satisfied!"
0,For the price this was an ok purchase...the camera picture is not very good to say the least but overall ok for the price.
1,Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet.
1,Bought two for gifts. One for dad who spends a lot of time in the mall not by choice. Other fits in purse nicely.
1,I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
1,does what it's supposed to do and really well :)
1,"Bought it for my wife, now she ignores me .. Now I can game more!! Thanks Kindle!!!"
1,"Overall good product, bought two for my parents and they loved it!"
1,Perfect for my four year old daughter w/ geek squad protection
1,The echo is a device with great potential. Amazon does need to improve the search feature to make it more useful.
1,"This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends."
1,Works just fine for my Fire 7.
1,"I love this, it has so much . Music, Weather. It is worth every penny."
0,very difficult to operate this if having problems knowing how to get to the instructions. Should have some computer knowledge prior to purchase.
1,"I purchased this tablet for my 10 year old son and he loves it. Great for movies, games and reading books online. Definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children. The hard protective cover is a plus."
1,"The tablet is just what a child needs, it's tuff and the content is aimed at the children's needs. It keeps them entertained as long as you will let them."
1,Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.
1,I loved this product. Its stylish and easy to use. this is for my wife
1,"I bought 3 of these for my kids, and they love it. They are cheap and affordable."
1,"We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work."
1,The product was just what I was looking for. Got it on sale made it a deal I could not pass on. Enjoy having Alexa in the living room.
1,this is our go to when we are shopping online. It also has a very good functionality when dealing with kids it gives the admin the ability to limit what kids can see.
1,We wanted something simple reader for our kids. My only complaint are the ads.
1,Good tablet for a 1 yr old. At first was not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip. Good product for the price
1,You'll never need cable again!! All you have to have is the Internet and depending out what kind of build you put on your fire TV that's all you'll ever need!
1,"This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership."
1,Like the price and this a great kindle. great value!
1,"I use this e-reader primarily for library books. The amazon interface for checking out library books is cumbersome. However, the final result is great. The device works great in both sunny and dark rooms, syncs well with my Kindle app on my iPad. Battery life is very good."
1,"My 2 yr old loves it!!! We got it in pink. Love that you can put restrictions on it, as well as a timer so that theyre not on it too long. The games and books are awesome"
1,Just as good as amazon suggests it to work. I use ut every day
1,I love the echo!!! It like you having a conversation with someone.
1,"i love this product, it works great and for a great price"
1,Great product and my tablet was delivered to my home within the dates promised. Process was very easy and had very knowledgeable staff who helped me.
1,"Overall the Amazon Fire is easy to use. I would recommend this device. Also, Best Buy has the best warranty policy!"
1,"You get Amazon access with this which is pretty good, but it won't compare to an apple or android device when it comes to apps. My son has one of these but his grandparents got him a samsung tablet and he doesn't even touch his Fire anymore. He says because the apps aren't as good. Its probably fine if you like amazon products, readers, etc. But not as much for a lot of the games."
1,Easy to setup through the Alexa app. My wife uses to play music for her daycare children and my 8yr old daughter uses it none stop. Fun to ask silly questions to.
1,I purchased this tablet for my own use and have found to work very well expecially for Amazon App Store. Many of the same Google Play store apps can be found on the Amazon App Store. Battery life is good. This is probably one of the best value tablets available!
1,This product is very useful for watching tv and streaming Netflix and others. Easy to use and easy to hook up. Works great! Good alternative to a smart tv..
1,Love the new features with the back camera however the screen is a bit small. Overall happy.
1,Excellent tablet! I purchased for someone in a nursing home and she loves it!
1,I wish I had purchased this a earlier. Fun for the whole family.
1,Bought this tablet as a gift and my brother really enjoys it.
1,"What can I say,I love my Kindle! Has the right amount of light and very versatile to read.."
1,An excellent product. You can stream everything on it.
1,"Bought 3 of these for the kids. They have good amount of memory for all apps and music they could ever need, don't lag like other cheaper tablets. Overall very worth the price!!"
1,Product runs so smoothly. Way better than the fire-stick. And it allows you to do so much more.
1,Great day reading. The backlight works great in the day as well. It is nice to have enough light to read wherever you are. The batterry life is also long
0,"Bought this for our daughter to use, but nothing worked right and was difficult to use. It's a fairly cheap $$ product, and it shows. Ended up returning it and buying a Samsung the next day."
1,"I bought 2, 1 for my wife to replace her older tablet and 1 for my grandson, who is 8 yrs old. They both love their fire. My wife has told me it is fast and easy to operate while my grandson takes it everywhere and plays games on it."
1,Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
1,I have two fire tablet in different colors. I love to read because the books are so clear. Many books are available to read for free. I like to purchase both free and paid books. As much as I read it may be cheaper to just go kindle limited so I can read any book.
1,"The Echo I found a little hard to get used to, but with more information I found the echo very useful to have."
1,My echo is great! Great for entertaining. We put it in a large room and it easily fills it with sound!
1,bought this for my 6 year old grandson who's a bit rough but loves to play games and read...he loves it
1,Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.
1,Great product love the auto adjusting black lightLove the weight of the kindle light enough I can hold it with one hand an turn the pages
1,My son love this and it's his favorite piece of technology so far.
1,This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.
1,This is a great addition to our home. We use Alexa daily. We were concerned about setup and use because we are late 60s. But no sweat.Easy to use for music and lots of information. Learning more each day.
1,This is a very good tablet for a first time user or a young child. The software is easy to use and the camera works great.
1,I got this to specifically put in my kitchen to help me keep timers and convert measurements. The shopping list is an awesome addition as well whenever I finish something that I regularly use in my kitchen. Would definitely recommend for any cook and it's only going to get better with firmware updates!
1,"I absolutely love this tablet. I check my e-mail. I watch movies. The only thing I DO NOT like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site. But you must remember that it is a tablet, NOT an computer. I find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes. Amazon Prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money. Prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year. It also comes with free shipping. I tried it and it is good. I receive my purchases in 2 days. Prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks."
1,exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up
1,"If you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an easy streaming box for the whole family to use, this is it. The lack of a few apps is a bit disappointing but Amazon is expanding their library as time goes on, so be patient."
0,I usually read in bed and found this reader to be too heavy and bulky. I originally didn't want to pay the higher price for the Voyage but I exchanged this one for the Voyage and I am much happier with it.
1,Great e-reader as claimed and reviewed by others. Will buy again.
1,Outstanding Item to have and own when family and friends are visiting
1,My wife is a nurse and uses this tablet at work and she loves it
1,It's certainly better than the original kindle. The touchscreen is hard to get used to and it's easy to accidentally forward through several pages or chapters if you fall asleep with your finger on the screen. It is also difficult to look a word up in the dictionary if it's at the top of the screen because highlighting it brings the home screen. It is better viewing in light and because it has it's own light is much more convenient is the dark.
1,It was a good tablet for the very inexpensive price.
1,"Echo gets me the news in the morning, and operates my thermostat. I can change the ""wake word"" to ""Computer"", and play StarTrek captain."
1,Bought this tablet for my best friend for Christmas she loved it.
1,"The Amazon Echo is a very helpful appliance. Now my house is 100% ""Smart"" and with the sound of my voice, I can control everything. I love it"
1,"40x better than a Roku box, easy setup, nice guide,"
0,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
1,"I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products."
1,"Great little cheap android tablet. doesn't have the best of screens or speed, but for the price it cant be beat"
1,"So far this is the best, least expensive media player I have found that meets my needs. Every media player can stream Amazon, Netlfix, Hulu ... What sets this apart is since it uses Android, you can actually do stuff with it if you don't mind side-loading some stuff. In my case, I use it to run Kodi. Why? Well, Kodi can play dvd iso files. I have bought hundreds of exercise videos over the years, and need the iso in order to use the menus. With Kodi you can do this. The last media player at this price point that could do this was the WD TV Live. This is that, plus plus plus. Highly recommend."
1,Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.
1,"A very convenient little tool. Good for checking emails quick, like on a phone, but the bigger screen is nice"
1,"I saw a one day sale on this Amazon echo and was planning to buy apples version in December, but many review on this echo were above par . Speaker sounds great and Alexa wakes up easy or stops when yo command so. Alexa still has a lot to learn cause.she stumble across some geological questions . Overall satisfied and I plan on integrating Other smart devices with echo. Great Best Buy sale .I only wish Best Buy would have sent email stating order was ready , I told a potshot at going there 2 hrs later but was.at the customer pickup , so I didn't waste the drive ."
1,"I would absolutely recommend purchasing this product. She can play music, interact with you by playing games once you adjust your settings. You will LOVE her and want to buy one for each room.. We purchased an Echo and now have 3 dots for each of our bedrooms so we now have our own assistants in our bedrooms. DEFINITELY if you are considering this DO IT NOW!!! You will NOT regret it."
1,This item was purchased for a gift I red feedbackThe person enjoyed the gift
1,"I enjoy many of the options, reading, email, etc. Very unhappy about the ads that hit you in the face first thing. I'm even more disappointed that I must pay 15.00 to remove them."
1,Corrected the problem with the kindle not charging for now. Hope this is all that I'll need for the kindle. Thanks!
1,I'm using this instead of paying for a monthly satellite bill. It's worth it
1,My granddaughter loves this tablet. Love the fact that it has a two year warranty against breakage and also comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time.
1,Greatest thing since sliced bread. My wife's jealous! :)
1,"Picked up three of these for my kids to use. Easy set up, works good, the only problem is the WiFi is slow."
1,Great purchase was gift for friends and they love it!
1,Easy to use. Very good for those that need large lettering. Great back light.
1,My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.
1,I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp.
0,Its ok for price point but it is heavily advertised to manipulate you to purchase more from amazon.
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo 2 months ago mostly for my wife. She spends time in the kitchen and adjoining living room and I wanted her to be able to easily listen to music, check on the weather, ask about recipes, etc. We have enjoyed using the Echo and it has performed very well. The sound is excellent as is the voice recognition. I would recommend it, especially when on sale."
1,Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus
1,This is a pretty good little tablet for a beginner. I bought this for my 11 year old son and he loves it!
1,I love my new colored kindle. I can do anything I want with this one. I used to have the old kindle so wanted to upgrade. Great choice
1,I love this tablet...I purchased 3 of them One did have to be returned because it had a short in the charge plug but a simple exchange and the new one was good...I still gave this 5 stars because for 30 bucks it is still working 6 months later after some abuse by us being careless...doesnt scratch easy..would be perfect for kids too
1,"I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too."
1,This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.
1,"I bought 3 of these tablets for my nieces and I was a little worried about the quality because they were cheap. The quality is great and my nieces love them for playing games, watching videos, movies etc. Turn out to be a great purchase."
1,This product is great for all movie and show geeks.
1,I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.
1,The echo featuring Alexa works as expected. East to set up.
1,Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
1,"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go."
0,"Still learning how to use this tablet, would have liked a little more direction on how to use it didn't seem to have any paper directions included..Like using this tablet especially to read books, email and facebook."
1,The price on this. Holy cow. It's a great little device for the price. It's a nice upgrade for my child whose older fire was getting a little dated.
1,Bought for my 9 yr old. He loves it. Easy to use. Great product for the price. Love using it.
1,This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!
1,"Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality"
1,This is a great tablet especially for the price. The only draw back is that I could not load an app that I needed for work because Kindle does not accept google play apps.
1,Works great. Connected it to wi fi speakers and lights I think went and got a dot and connected that through a Bluetooth adapter to my old stereo system and that works great as well.
0,Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
1,Works great once you learn how commands must be spoken.
1,Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use.
1,"This is a good inexpensive tablet. It is only a little heavy and doesn't have a good camera. Other than that, the rest ia very good"
1,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!
1,"The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet."
1,Bought this for my daughter to read books on. Very pleased with the tablet so far.
1,I bought it for my grandchildren and they are happy
1,"Very good tablet, the price is worth, you have and the price and quality in the same product."
1,Bought two of these for both of my nieces birthdays and they were the hit of the party. Both love playing with them
1,Love this product. The coolest thing I've ever seen. When Elexa listens to my demands and plays what I want to listen to is pretty cool Everyone needs one.
1,Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display
1,"Great tablet, apps are in Amazon's app store, works great !when I initially downloaded software, I received a virus which I, managedto load my antivirus, but just barely since using the keypad was difficultwith the virus (iiicandy virus), but running the software A/V I managed to remove it... Have Kaspersky A/V for android..."
1,Are use this to automate my home. It connects to my nest thermostat to control the temperature and connect to my Harmony elite to control the TV and lighting.
1,"The Amazon Echo is a very easy device to use. It makes it easy to control all of your smart devices. Like music on your computer, cell phone, smart tv's, light bulbs, and many other devices. All you do is tell it what to do and it does the rest!"
1,Bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it! Gets to read all the time with out the strain on her eyes. Battery lasts for weeks!
1,Easy to use. Many options and apps to download. Kodi compatible
0,Returned it in 2 days. Digital assistants have a long way to go.
1,"Perfect gift for my mom who loves to read. When the weather is bad, she can download books from the library without leaving the house!"
1,Great addition to the TV! Quick plug and play and very easy to use!!!
1,I always need a nice reader with better battery power.
1,"The auto light adjust has worked great for me and I love the different options for page turning. Also, the smaller size and lighter weight is noticeable. If you are buying your first Kindle, I would recommend this. If you already have the Paperwhite, it's up to you but I've been happy I upgraded."
1,not only s it a great product but the sales staff especially mike Whitt tremendously patient and skilled in showing me the basics of the device!
1,So it is working great. She loves the learning games
1,"Ordered 2 of these Amazon Fire tablets for my children (ages 3 & 8) to use primarily for viewing netflix, playing games, listening to music on. Very happy with these tablets, I also ordered the 'amazon freetime kid-proof case' for the tablets and they have made it through 3 months of use and abuse thus far. Highly recommend this tablet if you are looking for one for your child. Parental controls are very easy to use and provide a large number of options as far as limiting applications, time limits for use and curfew options. My children are very rough on these tablets and with the cases on them they have not caused any damage to them at all. Easy to set-up and install apps, decent battery life, decent battery charge time, great picture quality when watching netflix or other streaming media, wifi works very good, lightweight and easy to hold for extended periods of time, intuitive controls and user interface. Would highly recommend this tablet for beginners or children."
1,Good tablet for kids to enjoy and play with not if you are trying to do something big on it
1,"I bought this item because I was hearing good things about it. Decided to take a chance on it since it was on sale for Black Friday. Started using it in December and then afterBeing impressed, I decided to order some TP-Link Smart Plugs. Now I can control the lights by my voice. This is great!!! I even can make appointments on Echo as long as you give it access to your calendar. On 01/05/2016, I saw that this WON Product of the Year (2016) at CES!!! I just got my decision confirmed more than ever that I made the BEST decision to get this item!"
0,"Got this during Christmas rush and didn't think much of it since it was slightly open. (They had none in stock and needed 4 of them for all my children ) upon opening item , one had a small crack (bearly noticeable ). Increased useage of item cause the screen to spider web... tried to return but no help with management .... store at fountains in El Paso Texas . So I have 3 perfect kindles and one cracked .... very disappointed 1 star"
1,This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!
1,Fun gadget for adults and kids. Great range for asking questions..
1,I bought for my nephew who is 11 years old. He is very happy.
1,"not top of the line but don't let the price fool you. If you don't already have a tablet and not looking to spend a lot this is perfect. Plenty of free apps and games. You get the most for your dollar on this product, makes a great gift for friends and family."
1,I have several kindles and so this time I choose FireTV. It is good quality and it works as promise.
0,I am unable to connect with iPad Pro which limits one of the primary reasons for the purchase. I will appreciated recommendations to connect the devices.
1,Love this Kindle. Worth the extra little bit to have the backlight. Very easy to use and worth every penny!
1,Great streaming device and it provides a nice picture and access to streaming services.
1,Great for a kid beginning. Cheap prices and plays all his games
1,Doesn't do much yet not enough skills to learn just yet
1,I love my Kindle Fire! I like the bigger screen of the HD8 versus the 7.
1,"I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol."
0,I bought it for college textbooks but took it back because it didn't work for this particular device.
1,Awesome screen and battery life! Also lightweight and handy.
1,I really didn't expect it to be so convenient. Carrying just the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite instead of multiple books.
1,"I was in a Best Buy store when I saw the tablet on display with a sale tag indicating a price of $39.99. I bought it simply based on price. I have a desktop computer, two laptops, two iPads. In other words, I am computer poor. I use this tablet on airplanes to read books, access email, play games, confirm reservations. It is fast, highly portable and easy to use. The battery does last too long but that is not a problem. It is, after all, a $40 tablet. I bought several to give as gifts to nieces and nephews. It is a good computer for kids to use when learning."
1,Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! The volume is great!
1,If only the echo could sync up to a wireless Bluetooth speaker to extend it- it would be even better.
1,All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
1,I was looking for the slingbox app. Not many devices seem to support watching slingbox on a TV (not sling TV). This worked great!
1,The better resolution and slightly smaller size makes a worthwhile investment if you read for hours. The commercials that tell you how much better it is to read on a Kindle Voyage vs a tablet are true. I read for hours at a time on weekly plane trips. If I use a tablet my eyes hurt after just a couple of hours. On a Kindle because of the side lighting I can read for 5 hours and my eyes never hurt .
1,Got this for the tanks giving and found it to be a good one for my daughter. The battery life is pity good for this device and the device itself is robust as my daughter uses this tablet very roughly.
1,so much to watch at your leisure when and how you choose.. and its much cheaper than over priced cable or static satellite. . this is definitely the future of watching television..
1,I put books on it and read them. That's pretty much it
1,My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed.
1,"Grown to love this and I have three of them. Great speaker and Alexa is very useful, from checking weather, playing music, using as a timer and many other features."
1,Great price for a great tablet. Perfect for the kids!
1,"The echo is cool. I reviewed the google home product vs the echo. Amazon's echo has been out longer and partners better with more applications. The sound quality isn't as good as the sonos speakers, however it is still very decent and makes a nice addition to where I throw my keys. It would be nice if they made these on a wireless charging station so you could move the echo around more easily."
1,This is the 2nd one our family has. Perfect for kids games & watching videos.
1,We bought this Kindle for our son... he's moving up in the high school years and more books are required for reading so instead of buying books or waiting for availability at the local library it was the smart choice... download and read!
1,"This is a GREAT small tablet. I love that you can increase the storage memory. It's easy to use and it is light, not heavy like some tablets."
1,"Part of our daily lives in giving us news updates locally and all over the world, information in anything you ask like word definitions(synonyms and antonyms), math, science and other educational questions...you name it, it's just like Book of Encyclopedia. Of course, entertainment-playing music through Bluetooth connections and/or our Amazon Music playlist. Great and Amazing gadget for the whole family! I will buy another one."
1,"This device works great for streaming TV. I use it with PlayStation Vue, just download the app and you are ready to go. Easy to use and Alexa helps out."
1,Bought for uhd but not really worth the extra money
1,The screen is big and clear. Takes good pictures kids love it!
1,"The Fire TV has been a great addition to my home theater. It has a polished interface, and quality feeling remote. I especially appreciate the fact that there's an ethernet port included on the Fire TV. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the Fire TV."
1,"I was able to get my Amazon Echo through the pre-release special pricing when the product was first released. Ever since I have received my Echo, it has been everything I expected and more. Amazon just keeps adding abilities to the Echo every week, which is great. The speaker on the Echo sounds great when playing music. Alexa is able to understand anything I ask about 95% of the time. I really enjoy having my Alexa Echo around!"
1,Read the reviews and thought I would give the device a try. Works great. No buffering issues and picture quality is excellent.
1,"If you know of someone that would like to view videos or play smaller games, then this is a great product for them. This is more like an entry level tablet."
1,I liked this tablet because it's easy to use and I like Amazon products. But if you are looking for something simple that doesn't break the bank and gets the job done this product is for you.
1,"Works well, kids love testing it and ""adding"" items to the grocery list."
1,This has everything we were looking for as far as apps and games go. Easy to use and set up.
1,Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
1,"Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place. It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right “x” sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting “Go To Footnotes”. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the “x” at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as “91 highlighters” would appear between the lines. Supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text. Does not highlight any text."
1,i like this because i have one to and i love it.and i will never ever get rid of it i been wanting one and now i have one and my mom has one and her man has one and we all like them and they are easy to use.
1,good at this price running smooth as expected and cheaper than amazon
1,Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for.
1,I love Alexa. She works exactly like I thought she would. A must have for every home.
1,Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
1,No issues since Christmas. Works great. East to use for a 7 year old.
1,"I have bought the cheaper tablets for my kids, in the past, however, the sales associate recommend this tablet, and it was only 10 dollars more. So far, I am really impressed by the difference in quality."
0,"This is a rip-off! I will use my apple USB plug instead, for free!"
1,"I spent a lot of time resisting the Kindle and using the app on my iPad but I took the plunge on the Paperwhite for a long trip I wanted to use my iPad for TV while reading. The paperwhite is crisp, you can read it through day and night and downloads books with a quickness. I never would have thought such a simple device ended up taking priority over everything on my list of travel gear.Whether I'm on a red-eye or sitting on my back porch in the day, I can see the text comfortably and crisply. Really love this reader. Don't cheap out on the one without the backlight!"
1,This e reader is very excellent.The screen is a bit small but you can accommodate.
1,"Wish tablet was voice capable. Only problem was how long it took for the Merrillville, IN store to restock. They ran out at Christmas. It took about 2 months before they were available again."
1,Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM
1,"Are used to have an old laptop hooked up to my TV to view all of my streaming apps. This makes everything much easier. No problems, easy to set up, easy to use."
1,"Our family absolutely loves the convenience of the Amazon Echo, Just talk to Alexa and you have music, weather, news and so much more.. Great Product..."
1,My husband is new to technical devices like the echo and it has prompted him to want to improve his communication with a new smart phone.
1,"Love the size, ease of use and book suggestions that appear when starting!"
1,"Bonus that I can link my smart home (lights, outlets, thermostat) and have Echo control devices with a voice command."
1,this is the fastest streaming device amazon offers you will not be diapointed
1,"I got this cheap tablet as a gift for a kid. They can play games, watch videos, and surf the web at a very reasonable price. The performance is pretty good for only a $50 tablet."
1,It worked.
1,"Bought for at home use, haven't been around enough to learn it"
1,Alexa is now my BFF! LolShe keeps me company & entertains me with her jokes. Also reads my books & plays music without touching any button. Which I love the most especially when I am doing stuff around the house.
1,Good devices except you can't find some apps you only can get it from Google Play Store instead of Amazon App Store. You have to learn how to side load apps if you want to install apps that you can't find from Amazon App Store.
1,We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.
1,This is a great tablet for the money. The only thing I would like to see is a longer battery life. Otherwise it's perfect
1,Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great!
1,"This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn’t need power, I’d live for free!"
1,The echo is all that we expected; use as speaker/music in the kitchen.
1,I bought the fire stick first then returned it to get the fire tv and let me tell you it was worth the exchange
1,"Use it every day for news weather, music, alarm clock."
1,The Fire TV has a great interface and is very fast.
1,I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
0,"I picked this up on Black Friday when it was $30. It seemed like the parental controls would make it good for my kids. I'm not sold. While I can sideload the Google Play store, you can't access anything you download from the safety of the child's account. In addition, 8 GB is practically useless."
1,Gave ir to my nephew as a gift and he loves it....
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader of them all. You can not beat the quality of the screen. It is the same resolution and ppi as the more expensive model of Kindle the Kindle Voyage. The only issue you may have is the limited storage capacity of 4GB, but that's the standard storage for most e-readers."
1,"I love this e-reader. My other reader was not backlit so needed something I could use in low light. This works perfectly for reading at night and in the sun. The light is adjustable. Love downloading books from the library. It has a 3G connection which I have not used yet, so far used only in wi-fi areas."
1,This tablet is great for teenagers! I purchased two for my nephews and they were really happy! They immediately began to set it up and download free games. They love it!
1,"Who would have thought you could get a tablet for $50? It's fast, fits the hand well, and is perfect for traveling."
1,Great device and a GREAT price! Many apps available too!!!
1,"I purchased this Kindle because I had one of the old ones and I was unable to read it in the dark. This new one solves that problem. My only complaint is that if does not have the hand feel that my old one had, but I had purchased a cover for it and it felt like a book. I probably will get a cover for this one which will solve that problem."
1,Parental controls are key. My boys can download games within the parameters I set and I get notification of any purchases. 2 year no questions asked replacement is key.
1,Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
1,I previously owned the larger hd fire 8.9 kindle and loved it. I wanted a smaller tablet to fit in my purse so this was perfect. I love the color. It holds a ton of books and you can add a sd card for extra space.
1,"This device i exactly what i wanted, also i have purchased the Prime membership with Amazon which is great for ordering Amazon products, that gives free shipping, Movies, Music and TV Shows. Check it out.Definitely recommend it"
1,"Love my Kindle Paperwhite. I have always been a traditional book reader, but the Kindle is so easy to throw in my bag and go anywhere."
1,"Purchased for my son right before a family trip, This thing is great and packs all the features I could have asked for."
1,"This is my 3rd Kindle. I absolutely love it. The best feature I have found on it is the ""BlueShade"" option, which changes the light levels for when reading at night. Also you cannot beat the price. May be purchasing another one for my son in the near future!"
1,"The Amazon Echo is very useful. We have it placed in our kitchen where we can ask Alexa to set a timer, play music or tell us a joke. The kids love asking Alexa questions as well. The only gripe I have of the Echo sometimes doesn't understand what we are asking or can't find the answer."
1,"Counting back, this is my 5th Kindle since they came out. I've never had to replace one that ""died"", but sometimes I want the newer features. This one is to replace the older ""books only"" unit that is starting to be un-cooperative that I take to work for reading during lunch. I'd have probably just gotten another ""reading only"" unit, like a paperwhite, but these were less expensive.Pluses, can carry movies, music, etc, like my Kindle HD Fire. Can easily let me shop on Amazon, can access free ""underground"" apps, (i really don't need it for games though), and it is simple to use.Minus, uses power quickly, like the Kindle Fire HD, I have to charge it daily to every other day. I set a password (VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases. It has given me minor problems with books by marking that I was on a different page than where I stopped, and it ""links"" to the other Kindles and they go to that page as well. For some reason, accessories, like cases are more expensive. If you want to store a good deal more, you require an SD chip, ($11 for 32 GB)."
1,Very easy to use. The sound is incredible for such a smallfootprint.
1,Confortable...easy to use.Works great with any light.
0,Although a cheap tablet with amazon functionality it's a very slow one.
1,"Bought it as a gift, wife loves it. Plenty of memory and available apps."
1,Bought it for my 9 year old son... he loves it.... can do a lot more than expected.
1,This tablet is the perfect size and power for any work or home use.
1,"I compared this with the google home for a few weeks. We like that we can add items to our joint gmail calendar and add items to our shopping list with ease. Not a fan that you need amazon prime to play any song you want, but syncing other music sources are pretty easy and make up for this. It lacks asking for facts that google home tends to answer with more ease. We are adding automated lighting this week, looking forward to seeing how this works. Hope they keep upgrading it to keep adding new automation devices. Pretty fun and useful tool it has proven to be. Just added an echo dot for upstairs too. Also to note, adding the Alexa and Any.DO app to our iPhones has helped improve the usefulness of the device also"
1,"User FriendlyI was able to tie up all my streaming into 1 display. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Directv Now, Alexa is great, just hold the button down and ask away!!!!"
1,I got this for my sister and she loves it. She plays a lot of games on it.
1,"Easy to set up, easy to use, works very well with Alexa. Good content, prime membership helps."
0,It has what i wanted click to turn page and that is the only reason i paid that price for it. there is nothing special about it. i thhought that the battery would last longer and as an avid reader it doesn't last long enough.
1,Bought 3 of these for gifts. I am in love with Alexa. She learns new things daily and is easy to understand.
1,I've purchased Kindle Fire in the past for our girls and they loved them (literally) to pieces. They lasted 2 years before cracked screens meant replacement was necessary. These new kindles at such a great price point meant a no hassle replacement was easy! They work great and the girls are happy.
1,I like the size. Easier to travel with than my laptop.
1,"This tablet is one of the best.You won't regret buying this one.Good work,Amazon."
1,Love it! Have talked several people into buying one also.
1,"Easy to navigate, relatively durable, sweet little tablet!"
1,My family told me about me about this Amazon product as they cut the cable cord. Excellent and highly recommended.
1,This tablet is perfect for an adult and kid. It's worth the money. Inexpensive.
1,Great product!! I have several fire tv boxes and firesticks and these boxes are just amazing!! So much faster than the firesticks
1,"I have bought several of these now, one for me and they make great gifts. There really isn't a comparable tablet in this price range. I don't love Amazon's controlling interface that keeps you from downloading what you would with a regular android. Otherwise it works well for all my uses and for those I have gifted with them. I highly recommend them for the under $100 price range tablets."
0,1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn't fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can't get upgrade replacement
1,My children love it. Los of different things they can do to learn
1,"Excellent product.I have purchased several ( yes, children can break them if they try ).I am sure there are limitations as it is an Amazon product ( -.5 stars) .My family does all they want with theirs, and are very happy (we have 4)..Mine is a year old and works like new.( I believe a previous model had an issue with the power cord they fixed )"
1,It is very handy great when i don't want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere
1,"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
1,It's a good device for your kindle books and magazines. Very slow if you want to stream videos though. Don't think it was made for that. For its price is a great buy.
0,Right out of the box it didn't work. We took it back and the Geek Squad couldn't get it to work either. Great disappointment for my 9 year old boy since it was a Christmas gift.
0,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
1,Best way to cut the cord. Saved me over 150 dollars a month!!
1,I have 3 iPad so wasn't sure how I would feel about buying this pad. But it works great and enjoyed using it. For the price you pay it's diffidently worth it.
1,And this works perfect!! Kindle does not fail!! You will def. get your money worth with this e-reader
1,I purchased this item as a gift. She loves the tablet and uses it every day.
1,Out of the box this was easy to set up and even easier to use
1,"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
1,Product has been great. We use the amazon echo for almost everything.
1,I purchased this product because of family members and I'm so glad I did.
1,"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL."
1,Excellent streaming box fills all of my needs. Would highly recommend.
1,"My kids were wrestling me, and I called for Alexa to help. Guess it didn't understand my screaming from the other room.OK Best Buy, give me my 25 points."
1,"Alexa is very fun and entertaining. We use her for our shopping lists, hearing the weather forecasts and listening to our favorite music!"
1,Great product. Thank you
1,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, it has been great. I can set time limits I can set it so she has to do educational stuff before play and I can have weekend time set different from the week days. The protective case is durable , perfect for my clumsy child. I very happy with the product."
1,Quick and easy to set up and works great. Finally using my amazon account for something other than free shipping.
1,This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.
1,This is a great tablet for the right price. I bought two of these tablets as gifts to my sons. They were pleased.
1,"Got this tablet on Black Friday. I love how easy it was to get this tablet up and going. Now I don't have to use my phone to get on the internet. If you are looking for an affordable tablet, this is the one for you."
1,if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .
1,"Easy to use. Great price for a starter Tablet! I bought 3, 1 for me & 2 as Christmas Gifts for Family. It feels good with the Spirit of Giving when You know they use them everyday. :)"
1,Works great with hue lights and great speaker. Like the part where you can set alarms tell it to add items to your shopping list also just the weather news sports
1,"This is a really great product if youre looking to start your smart home.Obviously this works best if you have an amazon prime account, and even better if you subscribe to a few streaming services. You can still stream plenty of free stuff as well."
1,The Firestick game me the experience I was looking for
1,"nice addtion too my television it is so easy to use,"
1,"I really do not understand why Amazon has moved to the 6 inch format. The 7 inch format was much better and the screen size fir most aps better. Although I have relatively small hands, this one fits into my hand much better than the smaller 6 inch. A great tablet."
1,"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase."
1,This FireTV is amazing in the way it can turn any tv into a smart tv. It is quick and responsive. We only using it for its streaming capabilities but so much more can be done with it. We also own a Firestick and they both seem the same for performance. So if you only plan on using its streaming capabilities you might want to look into the cheaper firestick.
1,Great product to download movies/TV shows to watch offline.
1,I would recommend this tablet because of the value
1,"Was a gift for 5 year Olds, as far as I know they like them"
1,"If you are looking for something that will do your daily normal stuff, its a good buy."
1,I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
0,"I have an iPad already. Just needed something that I can read books on. Found this on sale for $40. Great deal. Not the best for net surfing, but great for reading!"
1,The kindle essentially gives you a library in your hands. You can read for hours on 1 charge.
1,I went to the store to buy an Echo only to find out that it is a hot item this year and they were sold out. A very nice young man helped me and ordered the item right away and had it delivered to me before Christmas. Great customer service!
1,"What a neat gadget. It is is easy to set up and we've had a lot of fun with ""Alexa""."
1,"This tablet works like nothing I've ever had Long lasting battery and great running system, , fast browser even faster app downloading,"
1,"Kindle paper white is great. Easy to read with. Lightweight so you can throw it in your purse or travel bag & take it anywhere. I haven't had the chance to use it outside yet, but will when the weather warms up. Best gift I ever gave myself!"
1,Great product... One of the few to offer 4K streaming services.
1,We were not expecting more than what we got in terms of performance but good enough for simple browsing and videos.
1,Great tablet for the price my kids love it I brought 3 more why not.
1,Buy one you will love it. I turned off cable and have one on all my tv.
1,It's great for my kids or anyone! The display is really nice
1,Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded.
1,My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
1,"I like it, it works great I have not had any problems with it."
1,I haven't had any trouble reading at the beach or the pool. It's easy to use and travels great!
1,I have both Apple TV and amazon fire tv. Love the 4k display and features that amazon fire tv has. The alexa feature is great as well!
1,No problems so far. Used by my 15 year old to play games and browse the Internet.
1,Kindle was no longer charging properly and this solved the problem.
1,"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week."
1,"The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is still the king of e-readers. I have an older version that I still enjoy and it was time to bring another Kindle into the house because of my fiancee. She loves the experience that the Kindle Paperwhite gives for the same reason I do, it eliminates a lot of glare and closely imitates an actual book. This a perfect creation that combines the classic experience of reading a book with the modern convenience of a tablet. A+ Amazon, A frickin' +."
1,My five year old son LOVES his Amazon Fire Tablet! It was well worth the purchase price.
1,Purchased a replacement Kindle for my Father in Law
1,"Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended."
1,"Easy to navigate & get acquainted with. Charges fast, holds charge! Very pleased"
1,I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
1,My first kindle has been to about 20 different countries. I just loaded up with some great books and take off on a vacation. I used to load up with actual books and leave them behind as I finished them. I'm on my second Kindle and it's just so convenient to read in bed and easy to turn the pages. It also fits easily into my purse next to my cell phone so I can read any time I have a few minutes.
1,"I really enjoy my Amazon Echo. Not only does it play my music, I use it for home automation (wireless) and can make phone calls to friends that also have Alexa. One Echo was not enough so I purchased additional Echos for different rooms."
1,"I never thought I'd use the echo nearly as much as I do. It controls our lifx lights, tv with a harmony, light switches by wemu, and connects to our vivint security system. I love it. It's really cool. I bought one for my brother."
0,Somewhat substandard. iPads are certainly better. But it gets the job done for $50.
1,"Awesome product, works great. Good for listening to music, asking questions, connecting to smart devices, and much more!"
1,"Great kindle! Very good for kids and adults! We have one for every member of family. Can play games , read , and use Internet. Also has a kid time to limit time on what kids see or how long on!"
1,I love everything about the kindle fire but i would like a bigger screen
1,"Perfect little tablet ., inexpensive and perfect size for what I need.."
1,Amazon fire has made a great product with this one!
0,Works well for the purpose it was used for not fancy but good quality tablet
1,"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
1,"I use it mostly for listening to music. As I learn more, I'm sure Alexa will get smarter too. I am 61 years old and even I can use it. Way too much fun."
1,I got this on a flash sale in at the moment and it was a great purchase. I didn't plan on getting one that day but I did and for $50 which I got it before it was totally worth it. I got a really nice blue colored Amazon tablet and I am happy with that. I can read books on it and use it when someone else is using one of the more expensive tablet I just want to relax and read a book. It is also great for surfing Internet you can play games on it as well. It is great for kids because it is sturdy even without a case it has still held up nicely .
1,This is a fantastic device. I can find anything cable has to offer and more!
1,Best product for the price. User friendly and easy to use.
1,"Having owned a fire stick, this product is much faster!!"
1,"This refrigerator is absolutely terrific. The Features are very well thought out. It works well for a mom who is into healthy eating with plenty of space and for kids with their own drawer for snacks and beverages. It's attractive, too!"
1,"I picked up this tablet, stacking some discounts and codes while on sale for $33 delivered."
1,"Great product. Perfect size and weight, doesnt take up much space.User friendly."
1,"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
1,Ask any questions about anything including playing music favorites. Save time by getting information ASAP.
1,"Love this paperwhite! Great for reading at home, at night or at the beach. Would definitely recommend for anyone else."
1,"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."
1,Employees were very helpful. I always enjoy shopping at Best Buy.
1,The Echo is so much fun and versatile. It continues to grow with more apps that are constantly being developed.
1,"The full size echo sounds great and is responsive. Setup is easy. I use it with Phillips Hue and Plum light pad. Works well. New ""drop in"" feature allows me to use the full size Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Show as intercom units."
1,"This tablet is great for browsing the internet, very affordable"
1,"This is a great tablet for young kids, It was very inexpensive, which is the main reason I got it. Kids are usually clumsy. It has most of the apps that the other services provide."
0,"Slow, advertisements on home screen are annoying can be stopped for a fee"
1,Easy installation and operation. It took about 10 minutes from beginning to watching.
1,This device is very easy to use and it's also fast and so many movies to choose from! I would highly recommend this to anyone!
1,I purchased this tablet for my kids ages 7 and 6. They love them! !!
1,"Good product, everything I was looking for in the Echo."
1,"This space is getting more crowded all the time, but Amazon was first out of the gate and also gives it the most attention. Echo has gotten smarter and better almost every week and I'm excited to see what comes next. Sound quality out of this unit is also amazing. No need for extra speakers like with the dot. This is an all-in-one unit. Add spotify or a free iheartradio account, and if you have Amazon Prime you'll be amazed at how many songs this little device can play. I use it every day to control lights, set timers, alarms, and more. Echo has become a device that I now can't live without, which I initially thought was just a toy. It's now my favorite kitchen appliance!"
1,This is a good tablet it was bought for my son who is 7 years old.
1,Bought it for my son for his summer reading. Kindle is working great.
1,By far my favorite product to stream from. I purchased the stick afterwards but it is no where near as reliable as the tv.
1,The kindle fire kid is easy enough that our 2 year old can work it!!!
1,I got this for my 6 yr old grandbabie and she loves it. It is perfect for her needs
1,"Basic tablet with good features. Does everything you need it to do. Great for social media, YouTube,Netflix, etc... not too much storage space, but additional storage options like SD card are available."
1,Improved readability really helps. Extra in-read facilities a plus too.
0,I'm still learning this I will submit another review once I use this more
1,"The price, design, size,and the resolution is perfect!"
1,"Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!"
1,Fire box was a perfect up grade to my TV entertainment system. The ability to show 4k movies made it perfect. My daughter gets to see her cartoons and I get to see my action movies perfectly. You can use Ethernet and dual band wifi. Its so much in a small box with a low price. ITS PERFECT!
1,I love my echo. Wonderful entertainment as well as other uses. I have a light linked to the echo. Was easy to set up. Eventually I will add the thermostat. Not large good sound and voice recognition.
1,"This tablet is great for trips. Just make sure you download games and shows on it first since it does not have Internet. The case is great for kids who are rough with technology, it really takes a beating."
1,"I really regret taking so long purchasing the Kindle Fire. The iPad was being so hyped up to the point that I didn't think the Kindle was as good. However, the iPad is not as good because after a few years, it no longer takes updates. What's the since in purchasing such an expensive item if it can't accept life-long updates? That was the purpose of me getting a tablet instead of a regular computer."
1,Great learning apps. My 3 year old won't put it down.
1,You can do a lot with this box to set it up for free movies if you know anything about computers.
1,"Great tablet, great resolution, very light and fast speed."
0,Speakers sound real low Not easy to use at allHave to pay for everything
1,Had to get to see what all the hub bub was about. The Echo as Texas Instruments chip and I work for TI
1,"Many daily features that can be used to make your life a little easier - plays your choice of music on command, creates to-do lists for you, can make adjustments to the warmth or coolness in your home."
1,"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service."
1,I am really enjoying this reader. The light is adjustable for all types of lighting! It is small enough to put in my purse to carry anywhere!
1,Worked well as expected.
1,"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun."
0,Good tablet simple to use and easy to learn and also great price
1,Enjoy Kindle but have to tap screen several times before it goes to next screen when I'm in e-mail
1,we're early in the stages of home smartness but this is a good start
1,"Great online experience. Thanks for making it easy for older people so they can understand what to do. Awesome buy and it was awesome to shop at home. THANKS, Best Buy. Queenie"
0,"It is a good entry level tablet, especially if you already has Amazon prime.A lot of power for the price. The only consideration is that is only has 8g of storage."
1,"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
1,"First let me say we love out echos. As a family this is our "" dance party"" speaker. DJ (Alexa) takes requests. With more and more updates to this product it has great potential.My only wish is that it were more intuitive for non high tech. Over time I guess. We love. Bought 2."
1,This was bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it very much. She uses it every day and it helps her relax. I am so happy that we found something she enjoys so much. It's screen is a good size and doesn't hurt one's eyes. It is easy to flow through the apps on the tablet. Thanks...
1,A gift for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.
1,Very smart device we enjoy to have it in our livinroom
1,I am very impressed with the tablet. For the price it is great. Apps load up quick and look great on the tablet. The OS is easy to navigate.
1,Was trying to decide between the voyage and this model. No regrets whatsoever on going with the Paperwhite!
1,A well worth purchase. I got this for my brother and dad for Christmas and they loved it.
1,Alexa works pretty good if your Internet provides enough service for you.
1,Bought this for my son to use and he loves it. I did the initial setup which was easy since we have an Amazon account. Otherwise there's a ton of free games using Amazon underground.
1,Nice budget tablet fast and does the job. For the price is a nice tablet.
1,Love the apps and set up done by the geek squad and the simple steps to set up
1,Great way to have all of my text books in one and read on the go
1,Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend.
1,this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
1,Got it for the sole purpose of controlling my home lighting. Works perfect!
1,"Provides information, services, and also amusement."
1,This unit streams it all. Works great. No buffering. Easy to set and and use.
1,"The Kindle Voyage is the first new model that I finally felt was good enough to replace my Kindle4NT (non-touch with side buttons). The original 4T and paperwhite models worked poorly for me, and lacked buttons. The pressure sensitive edges of the Voyage work great, and the touch screen functions work better in this model.Voyage is still at least $50 overpriced, but I ultimately worth the money if moving off an older button-style Kindle."
1,Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
1,It's a great starter tablet for kids an even adults at a good price. You can also use a memory card.
1,This product is well thoughts the kids seem to like the apps
1,Tablet has been everything I expected it to be. Much better then the previous tablet I had.
1,Love the resolution at night.. Very sharp and clear. A must have one
1,I couldn't read on my kindle outside so I got the paperwhite. Problem solved.
1,"Easy to use. Great for kids. Great for mom when kids steal mom's phone. Lightweight. Great protective case. But it gets really dirty, real quick."
1,"I got this on black Friday for $35. Even at the regular price of $50, it's a steal. It is a basic tablet that will download apps and go on the internet. While the internet browser isn't that great, it is comparable to a phone system, which costs a lot more."
1,Works great with a prime account. Get 1 free book per month. only problem is if you have 2 tablets you both have to share the same book. Works great with my local library..(Remember those?)
0,This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
1,Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.
1,The Amazon echo does everything it says it does and it seamlessly connected to my home automation appliances and lights.
1,Great addition to the home. So easy to set up and use. I love the shortcuts it has provided to my life.
1,"She loves it, plays with it everyday all day. Thanks"
1,My child loves it workes flawlessly and does everything she like to do
1,This device is simple to use and works great! Highly recommended!
1,Love it. Best decision ever right here . . dump cable and join the rest of the world.
0,"It's a good tablet but only for like little Childen to play on not for teens. I don't think it should have high expectations, if thinking that."
1,Having so much fun asking Alexa all kinds of questions. She is so smart!
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet is definitely not the best tablet out there, but it's definitely the best at this price point. It has all of the features I was looking for without the fluff. It may be limiting if you don't have an Amazon account, but it's not a deal breaker. I think this is a great tablet for those who aren't looking for all of the bells and whistles."
1,This device completely meets my needs for reading and accessibility.
1,Great product It's like a verbal Google that finds and plays music too
1,I like this better than the other devices its a bit pricey
1,"I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
1,What can you say for 30 bucks I got 2 great gifts love them
1,"Had the Echo Dot and it was time to upgrade. The sound on the Echo is fantastic. I use it to check weather, wake me in the morning, control my Philips Hue lights, Nest thermostat, and of course, listen to music :-)"
0,Good for playing music on a limited basis.Requires Spotify premium to play many selections. Frustrating when it only plays small samples of some artists.
1,bought for a 10 year old granddaughter but our 32 year old daughter loves hers also
1,Good tablet. A lot to do. Good storage. Would recommend.
1,"Had previously owned the fire tv stick to see how it would work, and i was impressed with everything it offered, so this full size Fire TV was just as good with faster internet (since it is now hardwired with ethernet cable) and has more memory. connecting was easy and everything was easy to scroll through. Having an amazon prime account gives you even more selections."
1,I like the size it fits right in my pocket and its not bulky
1,"Sure I can use my iPhone for internet browsing and email at home, but for $49 I get 4x the screen area. Silk isn't great, but it works for casual browsing when sitting on the couch in front of the TV."
1,I got 4 of these tablets for my nieces and nephews and from my understanding they haven't put them done since they got them for Christmas. So that being said I believe they are a great tablet.
1,This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling.
1,I really happy and satisface with all my thingsThank you so much..
1,"Love it. Use it everyday, and enjoy the books I have read on it."
0,"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
1,My first peice of smart home eqiptment. Love it!!!
1,This is a great value. A premium tablet at an economic price. User friendly.
1,Love Amazon Fire TV. Easy and simple to use and set-up.
1,Greet tablet to red your favorite books wherever life takes you with this Amazon Kindle
1,Portability perfectBattery greatEase of use. Excellent
1,Kindle I like. This is the fourth one I have bought
1,Pretty good tablet I use it for my 2 year old daughter she really likes it. Very practical small travel size device for when we are traveling back & forth on the road. Very sturdy keep charge long time a reliable piece of technology for my family & for my tech needs
1,I love it it works like a charm. I would recommend it to friends and family.
1,I recently purchased this product for my grandmother. She sees the text much better and the operating system is very smooth.
1,Great for the price. Get a screen protector though
1,Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
1,50 bucks and It's still a good tablet . I have issues with it cause I've always used the iPad so it's a completely different experience .I just wanted something to watch movies while I rode the train and this is perfect . The biggest flaw is the ads everytime you turn it on but makes up with the capability of adding storage . Look 50 bucks for a good tablet is cheaper than a night out with friends
1,"We use this as a hands free speaker in the kitchen. It is great for using Pandora and Amazon music. The only downfall to this product is that to take advantage of the many ""skills"" Alexa can do, you must memorize the specific prompt words for that particular skill. Besides that, it is great and I recommend buying one!"
1,"I love my Alexa! It was easy to set up and begin using. The kids love her , too? They like playing word games with her. I use it for music and for the different lists I have. She reminds me and sets alarms for me. I highly recommend Alexa. I just wish the accessories like the light bulbs and others were not so expensive."
1,What a excellent strean=ming player and with the 4k resolution goes great with my Samsung 4k tv
1,"I really loved this! It was the perfect size to carry in my bag, and the paper white is awesome. So easy to read. Also very attractive looking. LOVE IT!"
1,My kid love it.its an excellent one................
1,I already got this echo. I am a real estate agent and I love our Alexa so decided to buy them as a housewarming gift.
0,"purchased it tonight, time is wrong, you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the time.....AND IT WON'T CONNECT TO ANY WIFI THAT NEEDS A PASSCODE OR PASSWORD BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE CORRECT TIME!!!!!!! THIS IS 2016 TECHNOLOGY AMAZON? I've had many devices, but none that make you find a WIFI without a password (hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi...) all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!!!Returning it tomorrow!!!!!P.S. ALSO AN ISSUE ON THE AMAZON FORUMS, SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS!"
0,I enjoy this kindle. I was disappointed that the iPad gloss made it difficult to read outdoors at the beach but this paper white makes that very possible.
1,Camera a little lower quality and cpu speed a little slower than fire HD but a good price
1,Had bought the Amazon Tap and then decided to try Echo and feel it's definitely a step up in ease to use and sound.
1,Alexa has been a wonderful resource for our family. Most any question asked or any recommendations/reviews requested have been spot on. We haven't used her to order anything yet but may do that in the future. We did learn that you have to ensure there is nothing blocking the speaker & that you speak very clearly in order to receive an answer.
1,Great way to stream movie with out paying monthly services
1,I like this tablet I'm very impressed with it I didn't expect it to do too much but my goddaughter has the same tablet and I thought I'd purchase it for my two-year-old just to keep her busy when mommy has business to handle and it does a pretty good job.
1,"Very good price and very good and nice table, with nice pics"
1,This was a great addition to our home. Ask Alexa anything from what the weather is to jokes or play our favorite music. Highly recommend it for any home.
1,"I needed a tablet for once in a while use. So far it is great for my use. Small, clear and I like Amazon products so it was great to find it at Best Buy so I did not have to wait for shipping"
1,My wife and I use this all of the time to stream movies.
1,"I had one of the first Kindles that came out and really liked it. It was stolen so that gave me the opportunity to get the newest version, the Paperwhite. I really like this one more than the other one since now I do not have to keep a light on and still be able to read."
1,"This is my husbands tablet. It is just for general use, but he thinks it's great."
1,Great for streaming. Price is affordable. I will tell my friends.
1,You can use Wi-Fi anywhere that it's available. Lots of choices
1,They make the perfect gift. I give them out to my customers every year.
1,"I have used chromecast before; but heard a lot about its voice remote and other benefits. So, purchased this one. It is good; but i loved casting from my browser. It doesn't have default browser or in app store. probably I can install one using adb. Also, it is somehow slower than chromecast and takes a log time once it goes to sleep. I will recomend to someone only of someone knows adb and can add on apps."
1,"Pretty much this is worth it just to have Alexa play anything from Prime Music. My kids love talking to Alexa (once she understand them) and I use the timer function all the time while cooking. Only keeps one shopping list and one to-do list but its great to just say something and have it added to a list. Alexa is great for the capabilities she has, but the skills are limited so far so I recommend looking into capabilities or plan on programming your own. For example, she doesn't come out of the box able to read your email even though she can access google calendar. She is also not proactive, such as notifying you of a phone call or email. But overall, fun add-on if you are in the market for a speaker."
1,"Was a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it was okay."
1,I bought a fire stick for a friend and then followed it up with the bigger one for myself. Extremely happy
1,"Decent camera, clarity on the screen, fast downloads."
0,Good quality touch compared to other low priced tabs .. Poor on apps .Good for children to play around.
1,I found this product to be faster the other competitors products
1,This is a replacement for a kindle purchased several years ago. Happy to find the price went down and the product is better than ever. I highly recommend as an internet tool for both adults and children
1,My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
1,My kids love itBeats buying a galaxy tab that's double the price and compariable in my opinion.
0,"Smaller than I thought and processing speed is not very good. With that said, for the price you can't beat it..."
1,Bought 2 for my nephews who are 2 & 3. Very user friendly even for them. A nice grow into tablet for an excellent price.
1,esay to read screen and fast operating systemgreat for a young adult
1,"I upgraded from the Kindle Touch so I could have a built in light. The light is fantastic. While it took some getting used to the press buttons for page turning on the side, I love that too. Can use it with one hand, and don't have to take hands off to touch the screen. The documentation could use some work. A diagram with what all those icons are that they refer to would be a big help. Took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what I wanted. One thing, I HATE the new bookmark method. The old 'corner fold' was easier and less intrusive. Still can figure out how to delete from My Clippings. Also I wish Amazon would come out with a case similar to an Otter Box. I don't want leather OR auto turn on, which seems to be problematic on nearly every case I look at."
1,"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
1,"We ditched cable TV and went to Play Station Vue On a PS4. Two other TV's needed a way to watch Vue. Reviews said the Fire TV would do it, and it does it well. I agree with those who said ""In some ways it does it better."" There is a learning curve on the remote. For example, the upper right button gives you the Programing Guide icon with a quick press. After you have selected a 2nd program, that same button, with a longer press lets you jump back to Last program. Start up is a lot quicker than the PS4. If you also have Amazon Prime, the combination becomes a real bargain"
1,"Bought this for my very busy sister of two so she didn't have to lug a laptop around. She loves it - the quality of use (camer, web browsing, speed, etc.) was much more than we expected! Great item!"
1,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
1,Kindle is more fun than a spindle. Your reading time will never dwindle.
1,"Setting up the device for my sons profile took a litthe more time than I expected, but I love it. It's easy to navigate and has a ton of preloaded activities for him."
1,What can I say about the plug....it is great. Now I have the option of using the plug to charge my Apple ipod or using my USB cord and adapter that charges my pod directly into the wall port. I do prefer the plug though.
0,"Too expensive. Should be included, at no extra cost, with the Kindle."
1,My kids love using this device it is perfect for playing games and watching shows
1,My daughter really likes her new Kindle. She loves the color and the size of the tablet. Works well and was very easy to transfer her items from her old Kindle to this one.
1,I really like this product. Much better than my old kindle
0,It broke so quick. You get what you pay for honestly.
1,It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
1,Ties in perfectly with my wink hub. I am able to control my lamps and overhead light with my voice. Love it
1,"Got this linked to my Logitech harmony hub and SmartThings hub. Now I can just say ""Alexa, turn on/off tv"" and it works."
1,It works well fast and easy to get to my email and Facebook too.
0,"I know I can pay to get rid of the ads but it's just a bad idea, tablet works fine otherwise. And if your okay with Amazon apps."
1,"This is even better than the firesticks, of you have 4k TV, you can't go wrong!"
1,"Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements."
1,"I read a lot, check emails and shop, that's all I want and need from a tablet and this one is awesome!"
1,"Small, portable, light and fun to use. It charged fast"
1,Easy to use. Does it all. Faster than my other tablet.
1,The product works well 95% or so. There are days the unit seems to get confused or is very slow in responding
1,Great for getting movies without adding extras to your cable bil. Very small device.
1,Its awesome to be able to set certain features to ensure that the child user gets work done prior to free play.
1,It's great. I read it every day. The text is clear and easy to read. The battery life is nice.
1,"Unbelievable sound from a single source. Now I can simply say what music I want, the volumne and timer are a great feature. She reads to me and answers most questions. She even tells worse jokes than me. This has enhanced my bleek life. I can turn on lights and TV when I couldn't before. It gives me freedom over my environment."
1,"Alexa works a lot easier than Siri, Alexa is more like an personal assistant. Works great!!"
1,Works great & it doesn't freeze. Happy I bought it. Works better than the fire stick
1,"Alexa makes it easy to add a soundtrack to your life. Just tell her what to play as you prepare dinner and then change it for your romantic meal; no need to stop what you are doing. She will even give you equivalents as you adapt a recipe, tell you a joke, or read an audiobook."
1,Fire TV is great to watch our favorite movies and shows on. We have great wi-fi but some things play better than others on the Fire. The buffering when it does this will get on your nerves but all in all we like Fire TV.
1,Connects snugly!
1,"fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again"
1,I love this device. It has a host of information but you must ask the question in the correct order. The music library is really good. The jokes can be a little corny like all jokes. The alarm feature is good and the look and styling is outstanding
1,I got this for my wife for Christmas. She loves it! We both use it. This one is set up in our living room and because we love it so much I got the Dot for the bedroom. Still have to connect features for the smart home. We use the echo every day for a timer while we are cooking or just to play music. There is not need for an external speaker with this model. It has great sound with decent bass and treble. Don't worry about volume either... at half way volume the echo has no problem filling the entire room with nice and full music. I would buy 4 more of these if it would go on sale again!!
1,Bought this for my 5 year old nephew that is obsessed with tractors and chains. He had been glued to this screen since Christmas.
1,Christmas gift! They were very excited. Think they are working very well.
1,"This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one."
1,Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet.
1,Good for reading and watching netflix.Small and easy to carry.
1,"Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun..."
1,Yes the kindle is pretty nice. The battery lasts a very long time and the letters are clear.
1,Is great has a kids zone on it won't let them buy unless parents ok it.
1,"So I was torn between the google home and the echo. Went with the echo for the home automation and it's been better than I expected. It's smart, listen/understands really well. Its a very fun device."
1,amazon tv is apple tv with half of the price of apple tv. With more functionality
1,I have had friends who told me how great the Exho is. Now I totally believe them. I love the easy access to our Amazon music and morning weather and news while we're preparing lunches. Super easy to set up on our network. No complaints so far.
1,Love to use for news and weather Has been helpful getting information from internet Great Applience
1,Bought this for easier reading and it meets my expectations. Great display fidelity.
1,For home automation this thin really does it it can do a lot of things and also is very simple to use.
1,"my 5 years old love her new tablet, at this price it'a steal."
1,"We all love the Echo. My son loves getting weather, music and jokes and we are starting to set up the house for remote control through the device. Very helpful device. Can't wait to have more of the house connected."
1,"The Fire TV gives me everything I need from a media content perspective to watch shows and movies with several streaming media companies. Netflix, You Tube, etc. User interface is very easy. Going to be giving these as gifts for the family."
1,The 4k is pretty nice and they response time is nice. Wife uses this mostly. Haven't heard any negative comments yet. Got it to use for PlayStation vue.
1,"This one I got for a relative who enjoyed ours. We love listening to music, asking it questions and getting the weather. I know there are more features but these alone makes it a winner."
1,I have purchased 5 in the last few months and have been pleased with the products
1,Bought 3 off them all together go get your now works good when shopping online
0,Kindle fire is good because of the other things you can do besides just reading books. But it is slow and hard to read in sun.
1,Great alternative to an internet connected/gaming tablet for a reading device for kids to use in bed at night.
0,"Got ir in a deal for black friday, worth the money paid!"
1,Perfect for the price. Great for kids to play games. Good battery life too!
1,I never thought of purchasing it until I viewed it at the store. The sales person was most helpful

1,I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
1,We got this for our daughter before an overseas trip. She got a few books and loved it. It has worked well for her.

1,If you want any one you don't care about losing get this. It works well with anything you want to do from Netflix to reading or browsing the web. Perfect for travel. If you lose it or it gets stollen oh well you deactivate it on amazon and your out $50. Better then losing a iPad or galaxy tab. You brake it oh well out $50. Great for kids with amazing parental controls built right in.
1,Easy set up. 4K ready. Great picture and WiFi connectivity
1,Very good reading gadget.. delivers all I need. Size and shape good for take anywhere.
1,"Wonderful tablet for the price. Great for what I need. Not perfect for surfing the web but for reading, watching movies and listening to music it has been wonderful. Great deal!"
1,The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7.
1,We use this product to side load apps like Kodi. It works really well. I have never experienced any freezing of any kind or any lag time like I have with other products.
1,very thin and portable.. If i've read more i would use it
1,I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
1,"Love it. So easy to use. I previously had a Nook Color, but since the newest Nook was having problems getting library books at the time I decided to go with Kindle. Worried I would lose the Nook books I had purchased over the years. Nope not a problem. Just had to download a couple of apps. m.getjar.com to download 3rd party apps. Once that is downloaded, open m.getjar and find Nook there. Easy peasy."
1,"These days, Amazon doesn't supply a charger when you purchase a new Kindle. That makes sense because most Kindle purchasers probably have older Kindle models already, or other USB powered devices or phones or tablets, many of which will have included chargers. As a result most people will already have a sufficient supply of chargers sitting around.But for someone who wants or needs a new charger when they order a new Kindle, Amazon presents you with the option to buy one at the time of your Kindle purchase.So I was surprised when I noticed this new charger model now being offered as an option for new Kindles. My first thought was that Amazon had updated their previous charger models to bring them up-to-date and make them competitive with the great variety of third party chargers now available (see links below for these earlier models).As soon as I looked at the specs for this charger though, I was disappointed. Unfortunately, even though this is Amazon's latest basic charger offering, it is not in my opinion the best choice for someone who needs a USB charger, for a Kindle or for anything else for that matter. And that's something I wouldn't usually find myself saying, because usually Amazon's accessories are reasonably priced and competitive.This is certainly a capable and functional charger, and it will work perfectly fine with any Kindle device and charge it acceptably well. But here are the reasons why I feel this is not the best choice:- It will supply only 1 A output, maximum. That's sufficient for a Kindle e-reader but not sufficient for many other devices. Any of the Fire devices, for example, will benefit from a higher output charger in order to reduce charging time.Read more"
1,Helps to charge you kindle when not near a USB port.
1,"Purchased as a gift for my 10 year old and she loves it. Perfect size, detailed graphics, good battery life for those long road trips, and a SD card slot is a sweet bonus."
1,"Great tablet 4 the price, already preloaded with amazon apps,easy-to-use"
1,This was a birthday gift for my grandson. He loves it.
1,i am 61 years old and do not know a lot about tablets. i mainly play the games but it is great for that
1,I give this product an excellent review. I would highly recommend it.

1,Got this laptop for an in-bound college student. Best option that I found.

1,My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
1,"I brought this one, because that one I had still working but couldn't sign up online."
1,Great system enjoying every second of it. So easy to use.
1,"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
1,I bought this about a month ago and absolutely love it.
1,Very easy to use and download any size book you would like
1,"According to the info, the Paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a Kindle but I think any brand will work. It came in a package deal when I bought my Paperwhite otherwise I would've skipped it used what I've been using for my old Kindle. I gave it 4 stars, because I like it, but feel it's overpriced."
1,"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone."
1,"Excellent for streaming entertainment. Easy set up, works great. Compact, sits under TV and blends in."
1,I really enjoy this item. Very easy to use and navigate
1,"I purchased one of these for myself back in January, and when my mother remarked on it, I knew she wanted one as well. It works great for both myself and her, despite the differences in our reading habits and hand sizes."
1,Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.
1,Nice tablet for the price. I purchased it for my niece and she loves it.
1,I have purchased 3 of these tables still have them just handed them down one grandchild to the next will need another next year. They are tough the heavy rubber case really keeps them safe. Good product!
1,Items is very easy and a noob friendly. I love the item.
0,"Giving it an average rating because boo hoo, I haven't figured out how to make it work yet. It responds but doesn't seem to have answers to any of my queries or requests. It must be just a matter of connecting it to a proper wireless source. So far I haven't figured it out. I am eager to however! I guess I am just too technologically challenged."
1,"My wife & I bought this as a gift for her son. It's been a hit since day 1. His entire family has been enjoying Alexa, answering questions, getting weather forecasts, playing music. I'm buying one for myself!"
0,"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE"
1,It's good ... Just need to adjust .. Takes bit tine
1,Very kool watch all your Tv shows and movies we must Tell the humans
1,I love the paper white because Ican read it if I am out in the sun especially at the beach.
1,Bought this for my two yr old and she loves it not to mention super durable.
1,We bought this for our teenage son. It's easy to use and he loves it. We ended up purchasing another for our 7 year old daughter.
1,Scratches easily but otherwise good. Cases can also be hard to find.
1,"Great reader, light, good size, very easy on eyes, nice battery life. If primary use is as a reader, can't beat Paperwhite."
1,I never thought I would go tech for reading but the kindle has been a great addition.
1,"Overall dynamite product, it gives you instant access to a variety of shows."
1,I've had two other tablet before this one and gave both of them away due to shoddy performance. Finally decided to try the Amazon Fire after recommended by a friend and so far I love it!
1,"Love having the wireless tap to use anywhere. It's small, sound is good. charges up quickly. Bough the sling to protect it outside."
1,"This is my first Tablet and I love it!!Easy to understand and there are so many apps I read a sample book and I like the huge selection of books,newspapers and magazines The lighting is perfect easy on the eyes"
1,"Amazon nailed it. Its readability is superior to the book. The new page turning feature is a great improvement over the previous version. And, BTW, you can carry a library with you wherever you go."
1,I'm in my 50s and sat this up easily. I mainly use it to play music and news reports on a whim.
1,"Quad core planty of on board ram, and expandable storage? If this can't play it, you don't need it!"
1,The echo is a fun device the entire family can enjoy.
1,Easy to setup easy to use! Works great and easy to get started love it
1,"Love my new kindle. The backlight is a huge improvement over the previous kindle, but it's not an automatic backlit and must be adjusted by the user depending on the situation. If you're looking for an auto backlight, go for the Kindle Voyage."
1,"Fire TV box is great for streaming shows, movies, or music. I connected it directly to internet rather than using wifi and have not had any issues with buffering."
1,You can tell it to do cool things and have it also turn of lights etc
1,"I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too!"
1,Bought this as an adjunct to an older Kindle and so that I can also access four email accounts easily from one place while traveling. Screen is bright and makes reading easy. Item is small enough to get into my carry-on bag and I can pull it out and read emails from my personal accounts and my business accounts. I have also purchased the extra memory to download more movies.
1,Next generation of Kindle - with more storage. Allows the kids to download and play the favorite games
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet for 49.99 and I have to admit for it being my first tablet, it works great and I have no complaints so far."

1,Great tablet for the price. My nieces loved it ...
1,My kid loves it. It's really convenient for us to put educational games on it for him.
1,"At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light."
1,Still learning how to use. Would love to get local channels.
1,"Excellent Picture, speed and overall quality. Movie selections range from 50's to date. UHD is the reason I made this purchase."
1,So far it begin good for my 4yrs old toddler. She enjoy every minute of it.The parental control it's a plus. It also allow you to make multiple kid and adults profiles without any problems issues.
1,Love all the features that come with this speaker. Alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot! Above avarage sound on the go and got a great deal on it!
1,"Hubby bought this for us. We use to play music, check daily weather, make shopping lists, alarm for appointments, work, check movie listings"
1,"Although sonos speaker sounds better, this is not bad, and at a cheaper price. Soon it is reported Alexa will be able to control your sonos system as well.It also includes voice control and provides 'skills' which allow for home automation possibilities. In my mind well worth the price for the voice controlled audio features, and has potential for many other uses!"
1,Great device. Amazon is the way to go! Great quality of shows!
1,Having an only child this is his new best friend. They talk for hours back and forth. All joking aside the echo is awesome. I have the dot and the show as well and they are all great.
1,"Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it."
1,This device should be portable. The speaker is loud and the color is cool.
1,It was easy to setup and fun to interact with Alexa.
1,My child loves this device. She doesn't stop playing with it.
1,Love how easy it was to setup and use. Sounds is great and the features are abundant.
1,Great price for tablet. Works great for my 3 year old that loves trains so can watch all the train videos on Amazon Prime and can limit the time with the FreeTime settings on the tablet.
1,"I upgraded from the fire stick to the fire TV and man what a difference it made. Way faster a lot smoother and overall just a better experience than the fire stick. Don't get me wrong the stick is affordable and does the job,but if you want faster and smoother transitions from app to app the fire TV is the way to go."
1,I highly recommend this item. This is my second purchase of kindle fire. I was so pleased with what you can do with the amazon kindle fire. If you buy i highly recommend getting amazon prime you will have access to so much free items that will keep your child busy from movies to books and more.
1,Love this thing. Carry Alexa from room to room. Was a little tricky setting her up but I have teens who figured it out. Haven't had it that long and there is plenty of things you can use it for like calender and shopping list. The more you use it the more it does. It is a learning process but so glad I got it.
1,"Love this tablet, have bought several for gifts because I love mine so much!"
1,Great buy used instead of using smart phone for games
1,Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.
1,"love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
1,Not sure what to say about this except the jury is still out.
1,"I have an I-Pad and the Fire. For the price, you can't beat the Fire. Does what the I-Pad does and was a fraction of the cost."
1,We like the way it integrates with our Nest. Music on demand is great.
1,"My daughter first tablet was a ""kids "" tablet. This is an upgrade and it has plenty of apps that We All can play together on separate devices"
1,highly recommend this to anyone who loves music!!!
1,Its a fast and reliable tablet once you get past thw advertising. You can pay to have them removed but if you could afford that mights as well get the one without the advertising.
1,"Have always been pleased with BEST BUY, and will continue to purchase all of my equipment there."
1,"Love this product, and don't know why it took so l"
1,I bought this for my Mother. She loves it. She can play her games she likes and she can use kindle and audible all with just one device.
1,"Great price, item works perfectly and my daughter loves it!"
0,"Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
1,I need a sound system for a bbq party...it was just perfect for the party. Provided great background music! Powerful lil bugger!
1,"I absolutely love Alexa. It's the best purchase that I've made in a long time. She's so handy and funny too! I love that I can ask her to play my music, ask for a recipe, ask about the weather all within the comfort of my couch!! I'd recommend this baby to everyone!"
1,Extremely durable and user friendly very satisfied with this product
1,"I plan to get a 4K TV soon, and already having the previous one for a TV this should be a good upgrade. All of the same services are present and the remote has been improved (still bluetooth). Although the 4K is only at 30fps, it will be fine as the TV's and content for 4K start to role out. The upgraded processor and micro SD slot (up to 128GB I believe) should make future proof for the next few years at least. Easy to hook up and start watching as with the previous version."
1,I got this for my parents for xmas. They really like it. It's fun and is great for playing music. It's not as great for answering questions but does a decent job with simple ones. I'm disappointed it doesn't have an audio out via bluetooth or cable etc. It'd be nice to be able to hook it up to a stereo. I guess that is what the Echo Dot is for.
1,This is a great way to stop paying for cable or satellite TV or at least cut back. If you still want cable without paying for their equipment this item still does not support the twc app but does support fox go sports. That's why it doesn't get 5 stars.
1,"Purchased for a travel tablet for my niece. This was great! able to play amazon music, download a few books and movies, and we were off! I was not planning on this being a primary tablet, but it certainly did the trick for our trip and kept her occupied (even in traffic) for a 4 hour car ride. I am enjoying it for books as well."
1,"If you already own a Bluetooth speaker, an Echo Dot may be adequate, but the Amazon Echo is a great all-in-one product to manage your smart home products and stream music, too."
1,"Very intuitive to use, works great with the Amazon ecosystem."
1,"Practical and economical ok to use, fast and good for everyday use"
1,This is a perfect product for people who use amazon's services.
1,This is my third kindle and I love it even more than my other ones
1,Loud enough for small gatherings & very responsive to commands.
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter. Has easy app uploading and web browsing. Kid friendly.
1,Bought one for each of my kids. Unbelievable the thing you can do. This one was for my husband. He loves it
1,I love the Amazon Echo. It has great sound for playing music and I use it every day!!
1,We liked this product a lot! Web surfing and Skype is great
1,"this was a gift for my parents. they love using it for pandora and asking it about weather, traffic,etc. very easy to use and very loud and clear speakers."
1,Grandkids love it. Got a great price. Bought as a replacement for their broken samsung.
1,"I like the Kindle fire, but is lacking on instruction. Hard to figure out how to use the features. Definitely need a stylus tool to use."
1,The entire family enjoys interacting with the echo. It is a great way to organize shopping lists. We use the app on our phones to access the shopping list while out shopping. The kids love all of the extra features in addition to the music. Be sure to ask Alexa to play It's Raining Tacos.
1,meets or exceeds all my needs simple and fun for games. looking forward to reading my first book
1,For the price is the go to android tablet. And for a kid is the best first time tablet for sure
1,"I bought both the Amazon tv & the fire stick. I prefer this product cause it has a few extra perks such as 4K streaming, multi channel audio & hard wired connection to name a few."
1,Still discovering what it can do but it is a great item
1,It's ok I am just used to Google so much! But it still good
1,"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
1,Works great couldn't be happier! Puts out great sound!
1,This just a great tablet. A co_worker was saying that it is no as sophisticated as her $600 tablet and it isn't. But I can put one of these in every room in my house and still have money left over. This is one of the best $50 I ever spent.
1,So much more comfortable to hold than a heavy book.
1,I bought this for my nephew and neice. Off the charts!!! They're learning at an ecellerated pace.
1,İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
1,"Great price over the holidays, recipient thrilled with the gift."
1,Alexa is extreme;y polite and helpful! Just love asking for particular songs and instantly hearing them play with a crisp sound. Great device!
1,Love it! A perfect tablet with a 128gb expandable storage
1,Excellent buy as a gift for the young man it was purchased for.
1,Great little tablet to do what I need. I mostly just surf the web and definitely use it for Netflix and Amazon prime. Big enough to be comfortable and just relaxing watching your shows
1,Great as long as your expectations are in line with cost. A little slow but totally usable.
1,I bought this as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it!!
1,"Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools."
1,"It is a great price for a basic tablet from a brand I trust. So far, it seems to be fine for the things I want to do."
1,"I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do"
1,"Excellent purchase, recommended to all my friends, and purchased another on for my other TV."
1,Not for everyone. Have to remember phrases to command Alexa. Once you get use to it u will love it. Sound quality is not bad for a little device. Wish it had a built in battery.
1,Bought for a Christmas gift. Works great for anything we have tried to use it for. Great reader!
1,I'm using it with kodi and so far have not had any complaints. I bought a 32gb ad card for more memory but can't tell yet if it's helping.
1,For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place.
1,For the price it's an awesome deal the tablet is wonderful and will do everything that I want it to do for my 4 and 2.5 year old. It doesn't have a ton of storage but that's okay we will be using ours for Netflix and coloring games while traveling!
0,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
1,"This is one great tablet. I download books from my local library and read them on the go. I love the WiFi and everything about this tablet. I only paid $49 for it, but it is awesome!"
1,"Best tablet ever!Cannot put it down! Always ready to read, browse or watch tv shows and movies"
1,"I bought 3, better than we ever dreamed for money spent"
1,"I bought this tablet for my husband for him to use a home. He likes that he can sit anywhere and use it. He has a big laptop and does not transport well. He said he did not want a tablet, but he uses everyday. The only downfall on this tablet is that when you turn it on it advertises some online game and you have to wait for it to go away before you can use it."
1,Good sound & clarity. Also i would say it is good value.
0,its okay it does freeze in a game and have to reboot it. but its okay.
1,My kids love there kindles. They want put them down. This was a great Christmas gift
1,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE
1,Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
1,Very fun and entertaining as well as a nice way to play music.
1,We really enjoy the Amazon Echo. We use the Shopping list feature everyday. Comes in handy.
1,Fantastic product for a fantastic price and a fantastic service!!!!!
1,"My two year old loves the videos,games and books this tablet provides."
1,"My husband loves his gift, I would recommend to al"
1,Good size for space I had for the TV. The color is good.
1,I bought this for my 71 year old mother and it's great for someone who doesn't do electronics well. I would highly recommend it for books but there is not a lot of storage so be prepared to buy an SD card.
1,Alexa is amazing my whole family has a new buddy to ask questions to
1,Great device to stream movies or TV shows either wireless or connected with ethernet connection
1,"I bought it for myself. Loved the price and it works pretty well for $39. Didn't break the bank at all, very happy with this purchase!"
1,It's a good product depending on your internet service!
1,"I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle."
1,"I normally do not write reviews but this device warrants one. Could not be happier with overall performance and capabilities, especially in controlling home automation devices."
1,I gave this as a Christmas gift and my friend really likes it.
1,I bought both this and the fire stick. I like the box better becuase it has more storage than the stick. It's also easy to use and operate. All in all I think it's a good purchase and would recommend it.
1,"I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit."
1,Found this tablet to be user friendly and easy to handle. This was purchased for and elderly individual who is enjoying it very much. Battery life is not long enough though.
1,If your looking for an inexpensive tablet to get you started than this is the one. Quick set up and easy to use for all your basic needs.
1,"I've only had this for about a week now, but I love it and I love that I can set this up in my kitchen, and hear it throughout my entire house (even upstairs). It makes easy/ convenient for entertaining, playing music while cleaning the house and being ""hands- free"".I do wish it didn't require the monthly amazon music fee to play more music choices but it still has a wide range of music without the account."
1,"Works as it should, this was a replacement of the same item."
0,"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
1,"Bought to use as a reader on flights. Lightweight, great reader, more functionality than I would have expected for the price"
1,Got this for my mom. She has never used a tablet before. It's easily setup and durable enough to handle the occasional fall. She seems to like it so the money was well worth it.
1,"This device is like an all in one entertainment machine!! I really enjoy how easy it is to use and what is even better is that I am able to stream PlayStation Vue through this device. Now I can cancel my expensive cable subscription and just keep on ""vueing"" right now my couch potatoe life is on fire!!"
1,Great tablet and for a great price. Good for gifts.
1,"I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device."
1,Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy
1,Went into your store to purchase Echo. You were out of them. Ordered one on Amazon and it was here in 2 days.
0,Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
1,"I bought this for my dad this Christmas. Once I set it up for him and he's figured out how to use it, he loves it. (He's 58) He uses it to play on the Internet and read so he doesn't need anything with too many extra gadgets. But it's customizable enough to add apps and games if he wants them."
1,I gave this as a gift and have not herd how they like it as yet.
1,"It is a ton of fun, we enjoy the ease of use. Our house is not automated so we don't get full use of it. I do wish it used Google instead of Bing. But it works."
0,"Pros:CheapFunctions wellUsually pretty fastCons:Wifi signal isn't as strong as more expensive tabletsScreen pales in comparison to other Kindle'sFrequent burn-inIf you're looking for a cheap tablet that works, this does that. If you're looking for a top quality product at a bargain bin price, this isn't that."
1,I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
1,bueno
1,I bought this for a Christmas gift. She loved it. Went home that night and downloaded books.
1,I purchased this tablet because of its reputation very satisfied
0,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
1,Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis.
1,"This is an awesome tablet, great price, lots of memory, fast processor"
1,Not too big not too small.. I enjoy browsing the web on my new Amazon tablet!
1,We're all still learning all the tricks we can do. My granddaughter has Alexa read her bed time stories. My son likes her jokes. I like the 7 minute workout.
1,"This product is pretty spectacular when you have things to pair with it. I personally have HUE lights in several rooms in my house and the Echo pairs seamlessly with the HUE device, making controlling the lights via voice simple. The only touchy part with that is terminology you say to get the lights to turn on and off. I have only had my Echo for 2 weeks, so I am not an advanced Echo user by any means. However, this product seems to have endless capabilities and only developing more daily.My only problem came when trying to keep my Echo paired with my DISH box so I can control my TV with my voice. This feature seems to lose connectivity easily and has proven to be slightly difficult to re-pair after the initial pairing of the two devices. Other then that, the Echo has been a great addition to my home, and very user friendly."
1,I have bought this tablet for my other 2 grandaughters and it works fine for them! This one is for the 5 year old ! The other 2 are 7 and 3 years old! Great parental control features!
1,"Use expanding all the time. Would be a 5 if more consistent with finding answers in a google-like capacity. Bought this one for my sis, and she LOVES it for playing specific music genres"
1,Better than commercials!!! Used for holiday party everyone tried it out and a few bought one for themselves!
1,"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."
1,My wife purchased this tablet for my sister birthday. She really loved her tablet
1,this fire tablet is Good for normal purpose. and this tablet is also useful for childrens
1,Purchased this for my friend's bday gift. He loves it so so much!
1,"Your personal electronic assistant answering your question and providing answers, WOW!!"
1,"I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did."
1,"This is the best little affordable Android device around. Could use more memory, but love what it can do. The regular Amazon apps are just the beginning! Tons more you can do with it if you know what you're doing!"
1,"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
1,Great speed and fAst great for kid and teens Upgrades easy
1,"I love, love my kindle fire magenta. the color is awesome this is a truly the best kindle fire I ever owned . the colors availablesare awesome ."
1,Long battery life. Great overall digital reader. I highly recommend this product.
1,Got this when it was on sale to replace my old Kindle Paperwhite. Makes for a great tablet as well as an e-reader. Love all the different apps! And the blue color is so pretty!
1,I had read reviews. It is just like what reviews said. It is really good. I still have to try some features. Probably I should have gone for Kindle Light. Maybe next time. But for now I am totally satisfied.
1,Great size and storage for reading my online books
1,Simple product - great battery life - great for those just browsing web and playing games.Don't care for creating a second account other than email for amazon store and wish google play store came pre installed.
1,"I purchased a new Kindle only because I stepped on my original (which was the first generation Kindle) and broke it. I love my new one, particularly the lighting and size of the unit. Thank goodness I broke my first!"
1,Bought for my 2 yr old grandson.. and he loves it has a lot of learning numbers alphabet and shapes
1,"My wife treated me for my birthday, and I love it! Would highly recommend. Took a little while to get used to buying books on Amazon though. Overall excellent."
1,I like amazon fire tv it is good. but some times it is little slow and that is why I am giving it 4 star.
1,We love it! Everyone in the house is able to use Alexa. Very user friendly. The instructions were simple just set up and start asking questions or making requests.
1,Amazon did a fantastic job. I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift and he loves it.
1,I purchased 2 I share one with 2 small children also purchased an SD card games shows movies books galore the expandable memory is the best
1,Very good item can watch thousands of movies and tv shows
0,"The product works well except the WiFi drops every so often. Restart the firetv and it's fine. Also, the remote will sometimes not work. Pull batteries and put them back in fixes it. Kind of sad for such problems cuz I love the firetv."
1,Got this as a replacement for an iPad 9.7 pro. Much more flexible as to third party add ons . And after having both prefer the size of the Fire hd10.1
1,I purchased this tablet for my 4 yr old daughter and it's been outstanding!!! With separate parent controls makes it a breeze to keep kids away from unwanted sites!
1,"I bought 2 fires for older friends. 55-60 years old. They run jw library app on it. It has never given them any problems. I used the tablets before I gave them to my friends and they seemed reliable and plenty fast. A nice simple tablet, and the best price. A good intro to a tablet"
1,I bought this to replace a much earlier version. This is so much more readable I'm sorry I waited for my other to crash before I upgraded.
1,"Alexa has a lot of app usage. The speaker works fine for playing music, but I would not pay full price for it. I bought on sale, and I am happy enough to keep it, but I still Like my Google Home better."
1,We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.
1,Does exactly what I was hoping for. Amazing toy and everyone should get one
1,My child is very satisfy with his tablet. He really enjoy watching videos and play games. Is worth it.
1,My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games!
1,I like to play games and check e-mail and the cost was great
1,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
1,This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.
1,nice size and nice price for looking at my camera images on the go
1,If your tv is not a smart tv and you don't have a gaming system this is the appliance for you! Easy installation and very portable so you don't even see it!
1,Alexa is absolutely amazing helps with everyday needs
1,Good tablet for the price works like it should with good battery life
1,Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
1,"Set up was easy, downloading of apps easy for both of us. Has so many uses."
1,This is my second Kindle paperwhite! I had mine for more than a year and I love it. My daughter borrowed it and really like the weight and the easy to read screen - not too bright and not to dull.
1,This is a good tablet option for the price. It works well and is a good reader
1,I'm very glad that I made this purchase. I don't often bring my computer with me when I travel. I enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the Paperwhite.
1,this unit is so much better then the first gen faster and 5 stars
1,"Found that this device is extremely convenient, but it often has problems with buffering. They seem to mostly come from outside apps so that's why I am still giving it a 4."
1,"I already owned a firestick and needed a second one for another tv, I went in to buy and all they had were the boxes. I picked one up and I'm sure glad I did! The box processes a lot faster than the stick does!"
1,Recommend you buy the box not the stick. Better!!!
1,No need to wait - this Amazon echo is ready to go with enough features today
1,I can watch anything I want on fire Tv. Best thing ever
1,"For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great,"
1,"This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing."
1,I love my Kindle. It does everything I need it to do and then some.
1,"I bought it for x-mas for my 6 years old boy and he loves it. Great quality and AWESOME price, you cannot beat that !!!He uses it for Netflix, games and school..."
1,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.
1,Excellent technology in a small package and a low price. Works great. Fun and easy to you use. Many uses.
1,Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions
1,Excellent tablet for everyday browsing and use. And a true bargain at the Black Friday price.
1,Nice tablet for the price. Comes linked to amazon account
1,I bought this for my wife and mostly she wanted it for the touch screen and the back lit screen and finally after owning three different kindles she loves this one! She wears glasses and finds this one to be less strenuous after hours of reading. I would def recommend this kindle to anyone.
1,Such a better alternative than cable I am able to watch exactly what I want to watch without having to pay extra
1,I bought two Amazon Echo's at their deal of the day price! We love using them. Great service and product!
0,Silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. Had to install Mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. I can't put in orders with Silk (the default Fire browser). If using Silk make sure to disable the caching to Amazons servers. With caching on the browser is almost unusable.Ads are really annoying (only come on when you first turn it on) but I don't even really notice what they are. Usually things I'd never purchase like makeup (I'm a guy) or other junk. These make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. This is not a quality device like a Galaxy Tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.
1,A good enough tablet with great features and very decent screen quality.
1,Bought 2 of these so far and they work great for the price. Buy a mini SD card with it because it only has 8GB onboard. This tablet is a good buy for your kids and you can enable parental controls if you choose to do so. I would recommend this tablet as a good buy. It's not the fastest thing around but it gets the job done. At 50 dollars you can break it and not care lol.
1,We used this tablet as a prize for a raffle winner. It was a big hit and the winner says she uses it a lot!
1,I purchased this Amazon Kindle Fire for my mother. She is new to technology and loves this tablet.
1,Purchased for my toddler. Best investment yet. Also added the protection plan. Very happy with purchase. Serves it purpose.
1,I would recommend this item who likes watching current TV and Movies and also the archived shows & movies
1,"Good tablet to browse the Web, good for a beginner"
1,"Easy to use, good battery time. Would recommend for anyone."
1,Once I finish making my house a smart house this is gonna be amazing. Love it for playing music right now.
1,This item is a must if you have a Amazon Prime Membership!
1,"My daycare love thsee tablets, they have a lot of fun games on it"
1,This product makes it easier to pay my bills online and search for things to buy
1,"The resolution and contrast are great, and unlike multi-use tablets, this performs great in direct sunlight. With the adjustable light, it's also great for pitch-black rooms. The battery life is also better than any tablet you'll find. I can't imagine going back to paper books ever again, not only because of the convenience of the Kindle, but Kindle books are always cheaper than their physical counterparts! I love this thing."
0,"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls"
1,"cannot connect to bluetooth, for this price it is a nice item"
1,This is my first kindle and I love it. I have used it every day since I bought it.
1,Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.
1,item has a fast processor and is cheaper than the Roku and Apple TV for cord cutting
1,"Love it!! I installed a app that allows me to watch almost every movie and tv show for free! Never have any problems with it and works really well, if you can't afford cable or direct tv this would be the next best thing to do but you do need the internet for it to work."
1,This item is the best for your buck! This item hands down won't let you down!
1,We now own the Echo and the dot and both are great and can't be recommended more
1,I choose store pick Up in New York and works Great. Love my Kindle Voyage
1,"Love my kindle fire, takes awesome pictures and its convenient for on the go."
1,Good for my girl she use for reading play app and small carried
1,Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value
1,Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won't stop playing it
1,I buy the amazon firetv im happy with the quality picture and sound i really recomend to try this product
1,"Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones"
1,"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
1,The best tablet I have purchased from Best Buy. Will buy more
1,"I have one of the original kindles (I believe its the second version) with no back light so I thought I might like this one. Although I still prefer paper books for the most part, this is a nice addition. I think, however, that it should cost less for what it does."
1,We love having the echo in our home. Was going to be a Christmas present but we couldn't wait to use it. We like it so much we even took it on vacation with us. The shopping app is great. Jokes are pretty funny. She's great at history and I never miss my morning report!
1,This was a Christmas present for my 3 year old son. He loves having his own 'pad pad'. He sees everyone else with a tablet and can now play age appropriate games and watch his shows without me having to worry.
1,Got one to go with my Kindle Paper white! Works great!
1,I purchased this to replace a 2nd generation Kindle for my wife. She wanted it because of the backlight. The item exceeded her expectations. Great battery life too. I took he old kindle but plan to buy me one of these in the future.
1,Great deal for the money. My daughter loves it and I'm glad.
1,"I would recommend it to others,just wish it came with the battery so you didn't have plug it in."
1,"I preferred reading hard copy books but now am liking the Kindle better. It is easy to access books through my local library. Also, like the size which is easier to carry around than hard cover books."
1,This was perfect for my son! He loves it and loves to read.
1,"This was bought for a college student. She loves it, and it is easy to use and carry with the large amounts of books she has already."
1,Perfect purchase for the avid readers in my family. Both my son and I enjoy using the Kindle. So much easier than carrying a book around especially when the book is a tome!
1,Really like the Wi Fi & being able to take it to any room in the house. My music sounds great. Love all the features.
1,"An excellent voice activated hands free device. I use for steaming music, sleep machine, blue tooth speakers, alarm clock, and timer. It has so many uses. Looking forward to finding more that it can do."
1,Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
1,Wanted to cut the cable cord and heard from friends about fire tv. Gave it a go and so glad I did. We love the programming and we pay for the shows we want instead of overpaying for cable. Would highly recommend fire tv
1,Purchased this for 6 year old boy and couldn't be happier
1,Excellent Reader and Product for the price. Very easy to use
1,This product works great. It was very easy to. Setup and get an account going I would recommend the fire tv to everyone that wants to cut the cord from cable. It was cheaper to purchase it at Best Buy then it was on Amazon
1,I will start off with the fact that I like paper books a lot. I bought the e reader because it's light and can travel with multiple books. The interface is fairly easy to use and it holds a lot of books. The automatic light feature doesn't work as nicely as I would. Overall I am happy with the purchase but there are features that could make it a 5.
1,I got this tablet for my grandson as a Christmas gift because of the timed parental control feature.
1,My child loves this tablet! He is on it all day long! Wish youtube was easier to use though.
1,"I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit."
1,I had 2 Fire Sticks and bought this FireTV to begin streaming PlayStation Vue. It's much faster than the other streaming devices I have and the whole family enjoys using it.
1,Amazon Fire TV is easy to use and is very easy to setup.
1,Love it! Glad I got the one with voice command. Don't have extra speakers so this works better than the dot for me.
1,We only use Alexa for music and are glad we purchased the larger speaker.
1,"Great tablet for Web surfing, reading and social media. Also has a good camera"
1,Best smart gadget to have at home. Works with my smart things and Philips hue!
1,Works very well for children and people of all ages.
1,I have owned many tablets in the $250 and below range. This is great for the $. A bargain with lots of utility at only $50!
1,"This is one cool item. It doesn't take up a lot of space, has a great sound and is like having a personal assistant."
1,"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
1,Love how I can move my TV to a position I can see from other angles as needed.
1,Faster and better than any roku or apple tv! Great buy for the price

1,The Amazon Fire Tablet is great for book reading and simple apps.
1,"I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it."
1,Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.
1,I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
0,I purchased 3 kindles for my grandchildren for Christmas last year. I have been very disappointed with their quality. The chargers were very difficult to plug in right from the beginning and now one of the kindles won't even charge at all. The others have to be positioned just right or they won't charge either. I definitely would not recommend this particular model kindle to anyone.
1,"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself."
1,"Works great, just as expected. The Kindle doesn't need to charge very often, but I use this all the time for my phone. Nice to have a charger in more than one room."
1,I brought to my 2 nices and so far they are enjoy it ....
1,My original kindle keyboard died after four years. I spent the day looking at reviews online and asking friends about theirs. Went out that night and made my purchase. Love it! Wish I'd retired the other one sooner.
0,"I am really disappointed in this Kindle....I have had many kindles, but I wanted somwthing I thoughtnwould be simple. This kindle doesn't show all my books that are in my cloud..it doesn't matter that they aren't in my device but they should still show up in my cloud...I have to go to my amazon account and transfer the book I want to my device."
1,Tucks into my purse for on the go entertainment.It has great battery life for reading or gaming.
1,This is my second Alexa. Have one down stairs and needed one up stairs for me to ad my schedules and to take with me on vacation. We had so much fun when family came in to visit on vacation and found out about Alexa. They where talking more to her than us. I was ready to turn her off.
1,Buy it!! I can whisper from across the room and it understands perfectly. The speaker is great too!
1,Love love love my kindle. It was so affordable & has such great visual quality! I bought this smaller device so I could take it with me and watch my shows. It's great & would buy again. Love this AMAZON Kindle
1,Use to control lights and tempature. Works great for that. Also some music via Bluetooth.
1,"very good ""bookreader"" long battery life and easy to download books and return to public library"
1,Would recommend to others to purchase for a gift or everyday use
1,I got this for my niece. I would say this product is sturdy enough for kids 6 and older. She is able to play games and watch videos on it. She does occasionally read with it too. Overall a great product and won't break your bank.
1,"This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size."
1,"Purchased for 8y/o. Appears and feels well-built. Plastic screen vs. glass on higher-end Kindle models should prove more child resistant. Screen is recessed below frame edges, which also helps mitigate catastrophic damage in the event of a fall. Battery life is very good. Several books read at moderate brightness and still over 50% battery available. The screen has very good contrast ratio. In daylight, the backlight is completely unnecessary. The backlight is bright, and still soft enough to not induce extra eye strain. Highly recommended for any bookworm, young or just young at heart!"
1,My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
1,"Love this! Great for reading my ebooks, playing games and social media. At this low price you cant go wrong!"
1,"Nice little tablet, no frills involved. Small, lightweight with a decent battery life. Easy to root and replace the software with Android"
1,"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
1,Great for reading and for browsing on the web. Perfect size!
1,Spend the extra money on this vs just a fire stick
1,"great product! I love kindle e-readers! is light, fast and excellent."
1,"A simple device with low memory and cheap feel. I think if you are going to do a table, go with a Samsung or so."
1,My 8 year old loves his fire he takes it everywhere we go!
1,i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
0,Like the fact that you can add extra memory to this tablet. Overall great for travel for books and videos on Amazon.
1,Great product. The only problem is that my son is now staying up late to read books in his bed at midnight without lights turned on. :-)
1,I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.
1,Caught a Black Friday sale and was worth every penny. Does all the essentials with a great picture for videos.
1,For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of.
1,"it the best for Apps, movies, games and morealso it supports USB DVD drive for playback of DVD and supports sling and playstation TV"
1,Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!!
1,Got it for Christmas for my 4yr old she loves it uses it to watch movies on it.. great for the little ones to use they have a great section of kid shows to buy at a very good price.
1,"Great for cable-cutters! It works with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Plex and so many other video services. Highly recommend."
1,Good producti would tell a friend and family to buy
1,"Purchased the Kindle Paperwhite, prior to an international trip. It was well worth the investment! I created my own book cover (black), since one was not available (orange ... I don't think so) from the store at the time of purchase."
1,My kids love it but if you have ti many apps on the tablet it won't work until you free up some space
1,Wanted something not expensive but rather easy to use to watch children shows great choice
1,"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
0,"The tablet would never turn on, even after charging"
1,Much to learn about the capabilities but so far it performs as advertised
1,I liked this tablet very much. Actually bought one for me and one to gift to my cousin. Hope she will like it too
1,The Amazon Fire TV is a must have for anyone the loves to stream movies and videos.
0,I probably have to learn more ways to use it but right now it is just okay. Does not seem to know answers to many questions asked. I guess I expected more from ti
1,Nice and compact. Short time to charge. Good product.
1,Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
1,I purchased this Echo as a gift for my husband and he loves it! He likes having his random questions answered immediately and we're now looking into purchasing other items that work with Alexa.
0,"Nothing really great about it. It's basically a box to watch Amazon on demand. I have a smart tv, so to me this useless."
0,I had no cable but had internet so I thought this Amazon item would be good. Basically you have to pay for each subscription to use this making it super costly. I retuned this and just use Netflix with a wifi enabled tv.
1,Better than the stick 2 x the memory and speed great for streaming
1,I bought two of these for my great grand children. I charged them and played around on them before I have it to them and I wish I had bought one for myself. Everything worked great. I think this is a great purchase.
1,If you know anything about the android OS and what you can run on it this is the device for you!!
1,This is one kool little tablet. I spent some time with these and really enjoyed what they offered. The y make excellent gifts for little loved ones
1,Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it.
1,"This unit is far superior then the fire stick, it gets rid of the whole buffering scene :D. has option for wifi as well, get fire stick if you are going that route its the same thing but cheaper. Stream on :)"
1,"The Fire TV has a lot of content, especially if you are a Prime member. Apps are easy to install and use"
1,"Interesting concept to have Alexa playing music for me, ordering supplies for me, catching me up on the weather, etc. One issue experienced with Alexa at this point is the inability to access the kind of music I want at the time. However, we are working on it!"
1,Alexa thats all you need the voice command is amazing. Looking for shows or browsing
1,"Once up and running, Alexa can perform a variety of your typical assistant features. It’ll set timers, tell you the time, set alarms, tell you what your day looks like from your connected calendar, tell you about your commute or the weather and answer questions about all sorts of things"
1,My Amazon TV has two gig in the ram and a quad core processor and it runs great no problems right now only owned it for six weeks right now but it's good
1,My husband loves it! He has been reading since he got it for Christmas.
1,"This is a very convenient tool for me to read books, now it saves me a lot of storage of books"
1,I own several iPads but wanted to try one of these as I am an Amazon Prime member. These are a STEAL and what a value. The fact that you can insert a micro SD card to expand storage is a huge plus and I have been very pleased with the availability of APPs. I will be taking my this to Europe and have been able to download a bunch of movies for the trip from my Amazon Prime membership. I purchased at Best Buy with a gift card and now use it more than my iPad.
1,I love the tablet and would buy it again and would tell my family and friends about the fire tablet
1,"Couldn't ask for much more, performs smoothly, expandable memory, durable, inexpensive, and purchased thru best buy so all in all 4.5 out of 5."
1,This is a wonderful e-reader but I hate that you can only store books on the device. It takes up way too much space.
1,I like it I can add my shopping list the to do list and other things so far good no problems on my end
1,Awesome thank goodness for the next week and we will have a good day
1,Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
1,Great for my little kids to play and be occupy while i cook.
1,Excellent product. Got for my mother n law. She loves it
1,I lost my first Kindle Paperwhite on an airplane and replaced it with the newest version. I transferred my account easily to the new Kindle keeping my entire library. Love it!
1,I'm pretty impressed especially with the price tag being 30 bucks!
1,Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
1,I enjoy my kindle and would recommend to anyone. There is a good choice of books and reading material also.
1,"This is the 3rd kindle fire I've purchased, the first HD in this size. I like the specs, the speed at which apps and books download from Amazon, and the accessibility of free time for my younger sons. Definitely a worthwhile purchase and I am also an Apple user."
1,it works very well for a small black box on my concil.
0,Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
1,Super easy to use. Love how it's voice activated so it is convenient
1,"I ended up buying this tablet for my grandpa for Christmas , I started setting it up for him and found out I loved it. So I bought myself one, my grandma one, and we adopted 6 kids for Christmas this year and bought them all one. It's easy to use and great for all ages. I also love that they use the Apple Store so I can get my favorite apps and games on it. This is by far the best tablet you will ever get for less than $50. And it now comes in fun colors!"
1,Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!
1,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter so she can have something to play with and more importantly, to be used for her school as it's being technologically driven. Large screen and good graphics. It's great for what she needs. Parental controls are great for restricting access to accidental purchases and setting curfews so she can no longer use it at certain times w/o my code. I give this 4 stars only because the camera isn't that great. In low-light settings, it gets very pixelated, plus there's no flash."
1,My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate.
1,Having a new kindle is always nice but not much is improved.
1,"This is without a doubt the best Streaming Device on the market. Like the fire stick, I have also purchased many of these devices for friends and family (the ones i like more obviously because of the higher price), And I have had zero issues with any of them. These are capable of doing everything you want them to do just like the fire stick, but better and faster, and possibly in 4k if you have the content and technology to support it."
1,My daughter enjoys that tablet a lot. Also the amazon free time app is great for kids.
1,"Very Good Tablet, I bough one for every one of my kids, also I gave one to my friend on his Birthday, is pretty fast and also you can install a MircoSD card in order to increase the capacity to download more games & applications."
1,Works perfectly with my new Kindel
1,This made my brother life easier in school An work
1,"Easy to use and good interface, had for almost a year and still works fine, can easily upgrade memory."
1,"my grandson love it, he play with it all the time love it."
1,"Great basic tablet for the money! Great for reading and surfing the web, only complaint is glare in bright sunlight."
1,My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.
0,I feel that Alexa does not know a lot of information. It gets very frustrating.
1,"We use our Amazon Echo daily for music, shopping and to do lists, timers, and the weather. Because the Echo is hands free it's like have a personal assistant. We loved ""Alexa"" so much we purchased a dot for the Master bedroom."
1,very fast netflix streaming!! great item at a great price!!
0,The product is good just the speaker came blown...
1,I think it's a good starter tablet for a child. It makes it a lot easier to monitor your child while online.
1,Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
1,"This tablet is a great price. Perfect for those who use Amazon and want to use Amazon apps. Does exactly what it should and is easy to use.Decent size for surfing the web. Has a good screen, easy to read text.Nice to be able to surf the web, read a book or listen to music."
1,"It is a great tablet, not to expensive. Great for kids!"
1,Go for it what ever spending on this more than worth of it
1,I got this for my little sister. It is simple and easy for her to use.
1,"I have had nothing but great experiences with Alexa... everything works as expected, the sound quality is good as well as the speech recognition. I would recommend it highly!"
1,Nice tablet for beginner or casual user. Basic functions.
1,"The speed and build quality are a little bit low, but you get more than what you pay for. I recommend this as a good media consumption device."
1,this was just what I needed for surfing the web and watching hbo to go as well as amazon prime and all the books you can get. good product!!!
1,I really like this kindle. It's small enough to throw in my purse and the battery lasts forever. I really like it!
1,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV and I absolutely love it! Works great for streaming Amazon Prime shows/movies, Netflix, Hulu, and HBO GO. I don't have cable and with all of those programs I save money and get all the entertainment I want."
1,This is a great little tablet and I love the fact you can add more storage to it. So awesome and the battery life is fantastic. I recommend this to anyone. More affordable than an iPad and sturdier too.
1,It a great gadgets for the kids to stay busy reading and playing or even watching their shows
1,My Amazon Alexa is amazing . I have it hooked to my smart devices as well . She was a little stubborn when first set up but with tech support the problem was soon taken care of .
1,This is a must buy for anyone. It's sturdy and its a amazon for only fifty dollars. But the camera is not good for photography but its worth fifty dollars overall.
1,Bought for a friend and checked it out after purchase is a very neat machine.
1,"My wife initially talked me into this. I love it! Shopping lists, tasks, music, news, stock market,and on and on!! Well worth it and you have someone that talks to you, only when spoken to!! That is worth more than you can imagine! Highly recommend it!"
1,I bought this tablet as a gift for my granddaughter to play games on. It is very easy for her to use and it is just the right size.
1,I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.
1,Had the amazon dot but wanted the echo. Way better sound quality and responds much quicker. Very pleased with this purchase
1,"Purchased for my niece as a gift. She's 2, so to watch her online videos, this is perfect!"
0,"My uncle loves this tablet and its easy for him to use it, considering his age and lack of knowledge of technology devices."
1,Nice entry level tablet for minor Web browsing and applications. More bloat ware than I need.
1,This is a pretty cool technology. Still learning what all it can do.
1,The overall price and quality for this item was hands down a great value
1,great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it.
1,"I bought this Echo for my (senior citizen) father. Once set up, it is ""no tech"" entertainment and fun. He can ask to play music, ask for the time, weather, news, and even send me messages.It completely amuses him"
1,It's pretty fun to play around with this device by Amazon. The voice recognition is incredible. Test it a little so you can learn it's potential and limitations. Had it for several weeks now and still plenty satisfied.
1,Was looking the a base tablet for reading and videos on the go. This more than what I was expecting at this price point.
1,Just got this for Christmas so I haven't got to use it a lot. Can't wait to learn more about it and use it more.
1,"The echo is great for reporting the latest news, weather and playing music."
1,"Got it on Black Friday and it's a great little tablet for the regular price, let alone the discounted BF deal."
1,"My daughter loves this tablet, its easy to used and secure enough to not have stolen."
1,"I have been using this item before and it was great I love it and I did recommend it to my friends. I love the quality, the camera and the items that the device have."
1,We got this for our 5 year old and its very simple to use and sheuses it for ABC mouse and other educational apps
1,My kitten chewed through the power cord that came with our Echo and I had to order a new one. I was disappointed that I had to buy another plug instead of being able to buy a replacement cable like most USB cables. I bought a cord protector for this Echo power cord so that hopefully I won't have to buy another one due to a destructive kitten.
1,"My iPad 2 is starting to show its age . As it tends to slow, I thought of getting a newer version. Instead I saw this advertised and couldn't pass it up. Been a great decision so far."
1,"This is a really great upgrade from the regular Kindle, however, it's not such an appealing product after Amazon updated the base Kindle to the same hi-resolution screen. May be worth waiting to see if Amazon upgrade the Voyage over the coming months."
1,"I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! I love the user friendly parental controls!"
1,I actually had a kindle. But I have grand daughters and they always want to play with it when they come over .. Soo removed all my books from it and put their games on it and got me a new one for me... Now we are all happy. They watch you tube and Netflix and play games. It's a win win.
0,Had about 6 months very slow Started out good but has been getting slower . Cleared everything still not good
1,Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.
1,So much fun asking questions and getting weather. Useful timer and calendar. Love playing my Pandora.
1,"Bought this item for my grandson and now we both used it. Bright screen, good wifi connection and memory expandable."
1,"Perfect for what it is a cheap tablet, i bought it for my dad and he loves it"
1,this tablet is the perfect size and very light weight. It is easy to set up and does everything I need it to do. Having a camera is useful too.
1,I bought my fire tv last month and I like it sofar. I can use alexa on remote control not even to search in tv programs I can ask every question. for some reason YouTube app isn't installed by default and there is no web browsing app installed by default. The default country address is Turkey and if you don't change it you can not install some apps because of restrictions!!! Installing apps is tricky for some apps. I think it'd be nice to have more flexibility on software aspects of this device. Other than that I like everything about it.
1,I got this Kindle to replace an old Kindle and a lost Ipad that I was using to read my KIndle books on. T his Kindle with the back lit screen combines the best of both Ipad and kindle..back lit but no glare in the sun
1,I like the size and battery life. It would be nice to have instant definitions for foreign language books. I really like the vocabulary review.
1,I didn't want to buy my 8 year old something really expensive but I wanted a good device so I tried this out and she loves it. The case that comes with it makes it almost indestructible.
1,"I used to read on my ipad, this is so much better on my eyes and lighter to hold."
1,This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
1,Good streaming device. Simple interface and sleek design make it easy on the eyes. Voice remote works great (much better then phone) when it comes to searching. Would buy again.
1,This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.
1,I purchased three tablets and the grand children have been using them every day and they are working great and just the one that they needed. They are easy for them to use and even this grandmother can work them and that is a plus for us.
1,"My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun."
1,Echo is a fun and practical unit. Plays great music and controls my lights. Love it.
1,I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
1,excellent.they really enjoyed them. highly recommended.
1,"Fantastic display and easy to use, putting the device in rest most leaves an ad on screen which I don't care for. Nice long battery life"
1,THIS TABLET IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE. I WAS HAPPY THAT I COULD BASICALLY OPEN THE BOX AND START USING IT. . I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FRIENDS.
1,I really enjoy today's electronic gadgets and this is a really nice addition to my collection.
1,"Amazing!Already have the fire stick, but this runs faster, very good!!"
1,The tablet is great for my 7 Year old to play on and I like that it has parent control on it.
1,The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.
1,Great tablet and easy to use for a beginner to use
1,"This Kindle Fire is a good deal at $49.99. I basically use it for Amazon purposes only, I have Prime so I stream music on it while I am in the kitchen cooking, I use it for recipes as well and, of course, to order from Amazon!"
1,"Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet."
1,My four years old son loves it.You have everything for less than $50.
1,It's Just what I needed to be able to keep books browse the web etc
1,my great grandson loves this he plays games and looks at all his pictureshe is only 2
1,"Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!"
1,i bought this for my mother in law and she cant put it down she loves it
1,"No buffering, no lag, and does not freeze. Better than the FireTV stick or Roku."
1,"We have both apple and the fire TV, we like the fire tv the best. It's easy for all ages to access. Glad we bought it."
1,Got it for $30 on Black Friday great gift they loved it
1,"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
1,Super convenient. Battery life for weeks. Perfect for morning train commute.
1,"This is the cheapest tablet I have ever bought, but the quality is better than I thought. It is a little bit heavier than ipad mini 2, and the android os works fine."
1,"Excellent tablet, Easy to use and very fast. It's just beautiful."
1,Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my aunt, after Her laptop went out.She is happy with the ability to download apps and play games while in her recliner and even found apps for texting. It's very good for people who are not so well versed with technology and don't require a lot of storage space. She loves it, which is all that matters!"
1,"Great tablet for the price, easy to use, small enough to fit in my pocket book when traveling, it basically replaced my samsung."
1,"I just love my paperwhite! The size is small enough to fit in my purse and pull out whenever I have the time. The charge lasts forever, so I'm not always looking to plug in. I love that I can sit outside and read, or in bed at night, without light on to disturb husband. I belong to a book club, so it's nice to be able to add notes when I want to and to have the dictionary right there if needed. I can hook right onto Amazon, Goodreads or borrow from the library while sitting in bed. This is my first Kindle, so I don't have stuff to compare it to - but I sure love this one."
1,"With echo's all being able to be linked, this is incredible to have in all rooms. Great sound."
1,"Amazon typically makes good quality products for a decent price, so this tablet on sale for $35 was a no-brainer. Plus, it's easy to install Kodi and the Play Store without having to hack the device."
1,"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her."
1,This toy is easy to setup and the 4k feature compliments my 4k tv. The dedicated amazon fire tv works better than amazon in my smart tv.
1,It is perfect for kids. My youngest son can use it
1,One of those things that you never realize you needed until you actually get it. I can't imagine not having this thing now! Definitely recommended
1,"For the price you can't beat it , bought 4 as stocking stuffers 2 years ago, besides the one that went swimming in the bath all are still working as should"
1,Today's technology allows hands free multitasking. I would highly recommend..
1,Great for reading while traveling or reading in bed
1,Small and easy to use. This was a great value on black Friday.
1,"First tablet , got it for my wife, she found it very easy to use and loves it.. She is not not computer savvy, but has no problem navigating what she uses her tablet for"
1,"It is a kindle, and should be used as one - for reading. Other functions are a plus."
1,"This is a great piece of technology, it has 4K video output and all apps for Apple TV are available also for this box."
1,"Amazon Fire tv is just an amazing addition to your tv. Even if you have a smart tv, the ability to add so many more apps than your smart tv platform provides is great. Very customizable. Love it!"
1,"Love Echo - using in bedroom. My wife uses it more than I, and we're probably using only 1/4 of Alexa's ability. Mostly listen to music which fills the room well."
1,I was told by buying a new receiver that listed Netflix on the box that it was a good deal. Not so. Best Buy explained how this worked and saved me a lot of money. Gotta love this place!!
1,"I would have to say this things is so cool. control most of my plug in stuff, like AC in the room turns it on and off with the modular"
1,"Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
1,Bought it for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. Get purchase!!!
1,"I was really surprised with this tablet. I'm glad I made the purchase. I am able to do as much and more with it as a tablet I paid much more for. I also love the size. The mobility makes it much easier to carry around better than my laptop, Great buy."
1,it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet
1,"This tablet is fantastic. It's small yet biiger than my iPhone. It works fast and I've had no problems with it so far. Plus for the price, you can't go wrong with it. It's more than half the price of a Samsung or iPad yet works just the same. Don't hesitate to buy this"
1,Easy to use. Great price. Easy to setup. Small size
1,I have nothing but good things to say about the kindle! The Backlit screen makes reading at night very easy. I am a heavy reader and the battery still lasts for weeks!
1,"Easy to install, get up and running. Easy to use. Works great"
1,Got my FireTv box with kodi and is working awesome
1,Purchased for my 83 years young husband who is an avid reader. Getting his books instantly was worth his fear of going to a kindle. He's surprised at the ease of use.
1,They're happy and it keeps them entertained for hours
1,Fire tablet is a cheap one but good enough for my porpose. Actually you get much more than what you pay. Is an excellent retribution for your money.
1,"I purchased three for my children and so far it's been a little over a month and they are still fully intact and bright and working. The speakers are loud, quality of the housing is very durable and the screen isnt scratch resistant but a screen protector can handle that. Charging is quick and the port is still very durable. The volume and home button is easy to handle and the response of the screen is still very well. The colors of the screen with games and movies is awesome. Children love it and my husband and I do as well. We catch ourselves playing as well. Lol"
1,Price is awesome for what you get. For surfing the net and shopping it works perfect. Not the fastest but does the trick!
1,Love the new 4K Amazon box .. Looks great on my tv
1,Amazon fire tv the only way to go love mine better than Apple TV .
1,The Amazon echo is great. We use it to listen to music every day.
1,This is our second Kindle. We got this one because it is significantly better for reading in the sun. Our old Kindle didn't work well outdoors. We are VERY pleased with this new one.
1,Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
1,"MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN"
1,This good e-reader is a gift for my daughter and she love it.
1,Awesome to listen music! Sound is pretty good! Wish to have more features loaded in future
1,"This is a great, basic tablet for my daughter. It gets the job done for most everything she needs (simple games, movies, etc). Work great with Netflix and Amazon Video. Make sure to get a nice protective case if you are buying one for a young child."
1,"Love, love, love it! Very easy to set up. Was able to get rid of my cable bill after getting this. It's great!"
1,"One of the best products I bought, it's worth every dime"
1,Love the setup of this fine streaming tool!!! Use it daily
1,It is a great addition to the family. Very simple to set up and to program. Once you understand the programming the set up is great!
1,I have an older Kindle & this has so many more options. It has a camera & more apps.
1,I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
1,It would be better if it had a better camera. Its still a great tablet!
1,"Like the echo for quick information, weather, travel, music. It was a gift for myself - love it"
0,"I hate it, there isn't any organization for the apps"
1,Absolutely incredible ! A way better option then buying cable
0,"So I love, love, love e-ink. I'm not even a big reader but t's this magic technology that no one seems excited about. There is literally ink inside the screen that moves up or down electronically. So it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instance.I like the Kindle Paperwhite and it does everything I need. But this particular version doesn't have the same pleasing page color as my 5 year old Kindle, which is strange. But I really needed the light to actually be able to read when I usually want to read. So when the light is on it's pretty nice.The interface is rather slow, which is to be expected given it's not a traditional LCD screen (it's literally a printing press), but I wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books. The other problem I had was that the first one I received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen (where the light diffuses through) so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel. Also there were a few random stuck black spots. The next one did not have these problems. Amazon will replace it for you if it does."
1,Great kindle very clear reading would forsure recommend
0,A lot of apps are incomplete. Doesn't run apps that great and has a lot of apps that are generic.
1,Got this during the deal of the day for a great price. My son loves it and has downloaded plenty of games to keep him busy. Small enough to fit in my purse or a book bag and keep him busy while on car rides or in waiting rooms.
1,Great stable tablet for kids. Throw in a guard for the tablet and your kid will have the same tablet for months together
1,Finally decided to cut the cables. Will be able to save at least $200/month. One of the best decisions I have made thus far.
1,"A great Christmas gift, great for listening to music"
1,"Needed something to use because Cable got expensive. This does everything I need in one. No longer have to use the smart features on the TV. Netflix, PlayStation Vue, Plex, Amazon Movies all on one box and it runs quickly."
1,"Excellent product. We have fun talking to our new "" friend."" Daughter love the stories from the echo app. Very useful and it is used daily. Highly suggested."
1,Keeps my kids busy while I cook & when in the car.
1,"It was easy to set up and we have loved using it, great for the whole family"
1,Would buy again good resolution. Wish the screen was bigger
1,This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction.
1,"Finally stepped up to the plate and got into the Amazon Echo bandwagon; let me tell you, I don't know why I waited. Easy to connect, easy to teach it new skills, don't have to yell or talk like a robot myself to get it to work. My house is on it's way to the future!"
1,"She's smart, funny, entertaining and very helpful. You should have her in your home. She's so worth it!"
1,I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She is a huge music buff. This thing makes me wonder if I will ever buy music again. Tell it to play anything and it will. It's worth a purchase for this reason alone and it does so much more. Awesome buy
1,I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol
1,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.
1,We! love this product. It helps with everything....really
1,We bought on the Black Friday deal and they are great! The 8 is better since it is bigger but they are still great
1,"I find the Echo to be an amazing speaker enabled by saying ""Alexa"" to access all kinds of information and receive answers to many, many questions. It is constantly being upgraded with new capabilities and abilities."
1,Great product for a beginner. I bought four in the past month.
1,"Come on, $39.99 for a tablet! Value, value, value."
1,"Our six year old grandson wanted a tablet to use when he visits. This has all the features we were looking for, it is secure, only allows the kind of educational and fun applications we approve of."
1,"I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool"
1,"I was very skeptical at first with this, but Alexa has become part of my everyday use very quickly. Whenever I get home from work, or I need to do chores around the house, ""Alexa, open Pandora."" Its super convenient and the speakers on it are amazing. I'm really impressed. If there was one thing though that I would have Amazon improve upon if they ever release a version 2 is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now, which seems to be about 10 feet or so. More than 10 feet away, Alexa won't hear me. Other than that though, this thing is awesome. I'm glad I got it."
1,"The Kindle Voyager is the best E-reader you can buy! The resolution is absolutely amazing. The long lasting battery is, by far, the best feature."
1,It's worth the purchase. I use it every morning getting ready
1,"This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version"
1,Best purchase I made this year. I got the Amazon TV box for the TV in the kitchen. I took the cable box back to the cable company. No more boxes I am savings money. The Amazon TV box have a faster download and the picture is clearer. I can watch my Netflix on the Amazon TV box and other lmovies and tv program. I going to purchase another box for my family room.
1,My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn't have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet.
1,Bought this for my daughter and it does everything it needs to and setting up parental controls is quite simple. Great value
1,Great tablet for the basics. Mainly got this for reading. Not gonna use it for much else.
1,Great product! Lots of channels from everywhere. Easy set up
1,I bought two of this at Christmas. Great for everyone in the family.
0,"Still adjusting...had kindle fire and liked the ease of touch for turning pages, definitions and location in book. Paper weight is Much more difficult to maneuver, doesn't seem to be as touch sensitive as the fire. I have to repeatedly touch screen to get page to turn and definition accessibility also takes more work. Also, bookmarking doesn't seem to stay on page."
1,Portability is important to me. Really like the ease in using the echo.
1,I purchased this tablet to take to my classes. It's very compact and handy!
1,"I highly recommend this product. My previous kindle didn't have one, so I'm very please with this charger. It's much more convenient than recharging through my computer."
1,Faster than firestick and also has a micro SD slot plus usb.
1,"This is a great reader for children or adults, students, or just for pleasure. It's small, lightweight, easy to transport. It performed as expected based on the product description and reviews. It met or exceeded my expectations. I can use it at the pool, at the beach, in the house, in low light situations. I love my Kindle Paprewhite."
1,I purchased this item for my nephew and he loves it. It's small and works great. So far we have had no issues and the memory space is great.
1,It is running smooth and is a good tablet at a very low price.
1,"Good sound, understands most of what you say, the ai needs a little. I will be purchasing the Apple home pod when it releases in December for better ai and better sound quality."
1,"Wished it integrated with Google Play Music. Torn betwee Google Home and Echo because of this. But if you have wemo smart home like us. It works really well. Half our switches and plugs are wemo controlled. ""Alexa turn off all lights."" Really works! Google Home currently doesn't support Wemo."
1,I got this tablet for my mother in law. She is not a tech savvy person but it so easy to use. She connected it to wifi and now lives on it during her off time. I didn't expect a lot because it was inexpensive but it was well worth the money and I will be getting the exact same model for my mother.
0,I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
1,"Wow! it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carries tons of books! No distractions like on my iPad, with email messages pinging in and facebook updates to check...just books and lots of them!The Kindle Voyage is everything they said it would be...light, back lit with self adjusting levels, page turners, all the bells and whistles. I am so glad I waited and splurged for this one!"
1,My daughter absolutely loves her tablet. She's able to play all of her games and read books.
1,"Amazon Echo is a fun, easy to use and good value products."
1,It is very good for kids who are looking for reasonable cost.
1,Intuitive little gadget that helps with everyday tasks and information. I like that it's portable and I can take it outside when I want.
1,"I bought 3 of these for my mom, MIL and 6 year old. All love it. You can not go wrong at all for the price. And it's very sturdy. Love it!"
0,"I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me."
1,"Love the voice control activation. Being hands free is great. Just ask it a question or give it a command and it's done. Only problem I have is it won't sync with my hue light system. Once I get this problem solved, it will be all heaven."
1,A great way to stream very simple lots of apps easy to maneuver through great piece of equipment.
1,It's fast compared to the Firestick. The only issue I see is the remote becomes unresponsive sometimes.
1,awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
1,I like this one because it is easy to operator and the battery last a long time.
1,I absolutely love this product. I actually bought two. One for work and one for home!
1,"Had my original Kindle for 8 years with never a problem. When it finally died in December, I felt I could just use my iPad and Kindle app. But I missed the smaller and easier to hold Kindle more than I expected. Love the new paper white. No external light source required to read in bed, but easy on the eyes. Only regret I can't get my word games on it due to incompatibility, otherwise would be 5 stars."
1,What is there to say about the best 7 inch andriod tablet there is.
1,I have time to do what I have to do just because Alexis
1,Bought it to see if there was any difference between it and the fire stick there wasn't. Will probably place it in the guest bedroom since I really don't have a need for it
1,got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
1,"The Voyage is easily the best kindle avaiailable. The page turn buttons are a little wonky a times, but I find the high-res screen worth it."
1,"Easy to use, clear and accurate and very entertaining."
1,"I love my Amazon Echo. I use it for my lighting, to play music, shopping lists, timers, information and the list goes on. Makes simple tasks a little more fun. Love getting my shopping list on my phone!"
0,"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it."
1,I find this product to be very efficient for several reasons on an everyday use. The more I use it the more I like it
1,This is a great product. My only problem is that it got to hot and had to return it.
1,"I purchased this for stream since I have prime and the 4K ability as well. Also, for Kodi as I think is the case for most people."
1,I bought the tablet as a gift and I helped set it up. It's a pretty good product for the price. It will mostly be used to read books for which it works really well.
1,GREAT INEXPENSIVE ITEM. EASY TO USE. KIDS LOVE TO USE IT
1,new tv is great.wife enjoying books on kindle..!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,I got the Amazon Echo for a birthday gift and I love it. It's easy to use and sounds great.

1,Was able to turn it on and log into the internet seamlessly. Very impressed with the speed and apps available. Great for the price! Buying another today!
1,2nd one I've purchased! Does not run down charge quickly.l
1,"like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader."
1,I bought this tablet for my 7 year old. Great beginner tablet.
1,Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?
1,This new Osmo Mobile is amazing. The quality of it and the way that it turns on its own is just a match going into 2017 as far as the advancement of technology. Definitely recommended!
1,"super easy to use with great video quality, love it"
1,Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old
1,This was the best upgrade I've made I love the firestick but the box is much better!!!!!

1,"Great alternative to cable with lots of programming and gaming options, allowed me to drop my cable subscription and save money."
1,Lots of apps for kids. My 5yr old loves it. Great buy.
1,Great product that I would recommend to all. I ended up buying more than one.
1,"I love these things and this is the best iteration yet! If you like to read, there is nothing better! Not only are the books cheaper, you can get almost anything you want to read instantly. If you like to travel, it is a must have - you can bring with as many books as you want (I take mine backpacking all the time) and never have to worry about taking up valuable space in your luggage."
1,Device works great but is really best only for simple tasks
1,I like the tablet but the ads can be a little offensive from time to time. I wish you could block ads for magazines and game with immodestly dressed people especially on the lock screen. The device is very nice for what I paid for it once you get passed the lock screen.
1,I like to use it for movies and a lot of tv programs.
1,I AM LIKING IT SO FAR JUST FOR BASIC USE. READING AND SOME WORK VERY LIGHT. GOT A WIRELESS KEYBOARD TO GO ALONG WITH IT EASY TO CONNECT. NO problems very happy.
0,Tablet bought for a 10 year old child. Perfect pricing for a lot of tablet. Great pricing and good product.
1,"Great product, a much better alternative to the fire stick (which is slightly cheaper). Streams better, less buffer periods, and compatible with all programs I have used on it. Great purchase."
1,They had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it has the child settings
1,"I own the original Kindle reader. It had several quirks that have been fixed. Pages turn easier, almost all functions are faster, and lighted pages are much easier to read in low light. The only negative so far is the shorter battery life."
1,I love this tablet for my daughter. I wanted something inexpensive but quality for her. You couldn't beat the price.
1,"Great for family nights when you want entertain, and great for kids."
1,Bought this tablet for my grandson and he loves it.
1,Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around
1,I had a fire stick an moved up to the fire tv like it every thing loads faster then fire stick an it small an low profile design makes it nice to hide
1,The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
1,The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it!
1,Works very well I'm adding more home automation because of this.
1,"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task."
1,Great features if you're looking for a reader and not a tablet.
1,Bought it for myself and then bought two more for my kids. They approved it :)
1,Bought this for my 1 year old daughter for the learning games has a great variety of apps definitively recommend and cant beat the price only $50
1,"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
1,I took a billion pictures and they are all clear all my games download with no problem and I will recommend this to my sister
1,Just like the title...fast and perfect together with amazon prime (you don't need to have amazon prime to use this player)
1,Love that we can have access to so many movies and tv shows!
1,"Streams great, I love using Alexa to play almost any song I can think of and the interface from the remote is very easy and reliable."
1,Good first tablet or back up to take with you without hazard to a better one.
1,Love the lack of bells and whistles stuck in Airport battery lasts forever
1,Bought as gifts for sons based on positive useage of year old Echo in my home
1,"Great little traveling entertainer. Good for reading and playing most games. You'll be disappointed by the limited content and the internet functionality is very limited. Other than that, for watching short clips, or any Amazon content, it's great. Very pricey. I do not recommend this for kids."
1,Works great for reading books online. If only using for reading would be a great purchase.
1,My kids love it ... could be a little more user friendly for kids.
1,Just what my wife was looking for in a tablet. She wanted something to use to read & to have some games on. This was it.
1,"Works well, except during internet outages. The ability to perform hands-free tasks in the kitchen is priceless."
1,I bought a sony vue/PlayStation vue product to now watch cable tv. I found the channel guide to load a little slow when using the fire stick. that got me to invest in the faster processor and buy an amazon TV. I use the main TV that use and use the less expensive fire sticks for my other 2 TV's.
1,This device is kid friendly and is amazing for kids that don't like to read.
1,Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
1,Overall is a good product but sometimes you have to repeat commands several times
1,I enjoy reading my kindle. Easy to buy books. Long battery life
1,Great first tablet or just a great tablet in general.
1,Work well with my televisions. I am pleased with this product.
1,I've had several Kindles in the past. Really love the paperwhite because of the light and being able to read outside
1,Easy to setup and use!! Would recommend to anyone looking for a convenient way to add a Smart TV to their home!
1,I had the book e reader when it first came out and then I opted for a mini iPad but the lighting and reflection on the iPad made it difficult to read both at night time and day time when sunny. I did not realize how lightweight the kindle voyage is until I got it in the mail. Super easy to use and easy to transport! And best of all... Reading on the kindle voyage does not strain my eyes. Highly recommend this to my avid readers out there!
1,Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life.
1,I would highly recommend this kindle. It is user friendly and not to big. But large enough to see easily
1,"I have a Kindle Fire that is about four years old and does not have a camera - I bought the new one primarily because it has a camera. I am not disappointed!! The new one not only has a great camera but it is not as heavy as my old one. Also, the new one is much more user friendly. Liked it so much I bought a second one to give as a gift. A great buy!!"
1,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most."
1,Responses well and there are lots of skills to be added for increased function.
1,Inexpensive tablet that we bought 2 for the kids in the back of the car.
1,I have enjoyed many features this tablet has to offer.
0,Works but has a tendency to freeze or get slow. Probably wouldn't purchase again
1,Love my paper white. Have an old Kindle and a Kindle Fire and now the Paper White.
1,"Makes lists for me, plays music, tells me the weather. Great purchase!"
1,I feel the on sceeen page turner is a little slow and also slow switching between screens.
1,"I'm loving how easy it is to load my paper white with books and take it along on a trip or to the pool. I've used it on a recent cruise and it was perfect; I could read at night in the cabin and not wake my husband since I didn't need to turn on any lights. The ease of use has inspired me to read more, which is nice."
1,Did my research on this speaker and I am happy with this purchase. Do wish it had more applications like Spotify on it though.
1,I bought this product as a door prize for a party and it was well received
1,We got a pair of kindles for our daughters. They love everything they can do with them. My wife and I are now able to use our iPads.
1,"Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,"
1,I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I'm disappointed as it's really too big too easily carry around. I've discovered it's not all that easy to use it for reading purposes
1,Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great
1,"This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It's processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it's very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price."
1,It came with loaded advertisement is the only negative.
1,My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities.
1,This is a great means of watching lots of programs
1,"I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too."
1,"I bought this for my 8yo daughter to replace a Trio tablet that didn't even last 2 months. It has been fine for my daughter for playing games, checking email etc. No complaints here."
1,"My second purchase, new font is very readable in any light and especially outdoors. The battery life is great, no recharging every night like a phone or tablet."
1,Love my Kindie Paperwhite - it's light weight and small enough to carry in my purse.
1,Purchased the tablet as a gift for my mom and she loves it!
1,It is worth it to upgrade from the firestick to the fire tv. The UI is a lot smoother and easier to navagate.
1,"This is my second Kindle Fire. Although the first one still works, I wanted an updated one. It is the perfect size for purse or pocket and does everything I need, even things not available on my iPad. Each version has some changes and that got some getting used to."
1,I am currently using this item. It is very good product.
1,"I love it, all you have to do is to talk to it. I have another system I don't use just for no look for the remote. The bad thing with the Echo is that sometimes can understand what we are asking, but even that is fun."
1,"Cool Product! Bought the Amazon and Google items at the same time... One for work, one for home... The google does seem to be a better product overall, and it calls you by name... Both good products though..."
1,I needed something bigger than my phone screen to browse with and came across this tablet. The screen quality is good
1,I was really surprised by how long the battery still holds charge when not in use. Screen is awesome for a low res.
0,"The whole AI question and answer dynamic is cool, but the speakers are weak. The bass is non existent and the treble is harsh."
0,paid 39.00 on sale. bought two and 1 week later one will not connect to wifi will have to return.
1,"It's the perfect table for kids (personal situation) has almost same applications the most tables has, with affordable price.You will be happy with your purchase:)"
1,"Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use."
1,I think this item is great. I got rid of my Cable.
1,"The Fire tablets are taking the market by storm, Black Friday prices were hard to pass up."
0,This is a good basic tablet bought it for my 4 year old. Only complaint is that it doesn't have one of the most popular games ( despicable me) which my son loves so he still have to use mine for that. Plz update software Amazon!
1,"The Amazon Echo is a good product. The speaker system for playing music is good. It is not very load but it does fill the area with enough sound. The microphones on the system can pick up your voice from anywhere within range, as there a multiple speakers on the system. Once you have all your applications setup for Amazon Echo it is a very handy tool to have."
1,Great product for a great price. Would highly recommend
1,"Once you learn how to use it, it is fun to have. This is a bunch of junk that you have to enter so many characters to make this right."
1,This is the best E-reader on market. I've had previous ones but love that I can adjust brightness for night time reading without killing my eyes on a tablet.
1,This was an upgrade from the fire stick. Works so much faster. Stick is still great and portable but this device is good for bigger places. Works well with weak wifi.
1,Purchased this kindle for a friend and they absolutely enjoy it.
1,Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.
1,I got this kindle as a replacement for my daughter's other kindle whose screen was cracked but still functional. She loves it and she loves the OS. She doesn't really miss that it's not HD. I didn't get an SD card yet but since she has most things in the cloud it isn't really necessary at this point.
1,The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
1,excellent product and price from a one day sale getting it at half price
1,"Wasn't a fan of having to get one of these (I'm kinda old school...I like book) but, it really was a nice device. Easy to use and read from. Glad I got it!"
1,It down strings very well works very well with our direct Now TV would recommend this product
1,We have one at home to we thought it would be fun to have at the office to place music. However you can only stream 1 Alexa per music account which is annoying. They should have a subscription package like Netflix that allows more then one device to stream for a higher cost per month if needed.
1,"i got this for my daughter as a gift, but after seeing it action, i think i need one for myself. I think its almost like having an assistant."
1,"Works great, have used both with wireless and hard wired, works well both ways. Have bought multiple Fire TV boxes, and had one that the wireless did not work so well, so ended up hard wiring that one and everything was good to go, would have been a bigger problem if access was not so close."
1,Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.
1,"We purchased the Alexa without reading much up on it. We had several friends who raved about it, so we decided to get it before a pool party. It worked amazing!"
1,This is a basic tablet that is good for small kids to use
1,Excellent alternative from cable. Easy to install and use. You don't need a high speed internet. The interface is very simple format. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is cutting the cord.
1,she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
1,Great cheap tablet. Even better after you side load the Google Play Store.
1,"The fire tv was easy to set-up. Neflx, amazon tv, sling, and hulu work great."
1,Alexa is utilized by the whole family from morning to night.
1,"Gave as a gift, they love it! There are new things to love about it everyday!"
1,This is a great reader for the price. I love the light for reading in the dark.
1,"For me it is too small. I would prefer it to be 8""."
1,"The Alexa accessory is very accurate and handy for music and searching. Very good options for movies, tv series and children's programming"
1,"I bought the Kindle White for my wife. She loves being able to read a book, without having to use wifi."
1,The screen resolution is so much better than the original Kindle. Love the backlight.
1,"This device has been designed taking into account performance. In the past I used SmartTVs to see online content such as Netflix and Youtube, but the experience was always bad (slow response, hangs/freeze because of low memory, horrible interface and complicated controls). Now with the Amazon Fire TV everything works as expected: (1) Always ready, no need to shutdown, no need to wait, just turn on the TV and you are ready to play, (2) It's fast, very fast, no need to wait for loading apps, exiting or entering, (3) controls are very easy to use, very responsive - the multi-core processor is magic!Also, you can select from almost any streaming service you prefer (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Crackle, etc). Other devices offer less streaming options - is not because you need all of them, but you can change your mind at any point of time and you will not be stucked with your device."
1,I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.
0,Got it for my daughter and she loves it and I love the child age range usage
1,"What can I say, this is a great device that makes many home tasks easier and more fun!."
0,would have been nice to have instructions included
1,My daughter loves her kindle. She enjoys being able to watch youtube and Netflix. It's a perfect size for her.
1,"We love the echo. We use it to control Hue lights as well as get news, weather, and sports and play music. Will be adding other smart home devices over time."
1,This Fire Stick Model has expanded memory for storing photos and your favorite music collections.I would highly recommend this item.
1,it's a great way to receive music and get questions answered
1,Works great for a tablet and inexpensive. I got three in the past year and they all work great. I got them as gifts but I believe they don't have the same apps you can get through apple and Google play. You may want to check that out if you are using it for those apps.
1,"It's small and compact. There is no glare, battery life is awesome and it's very easy to read in the dark."
1,This is a much improved Kindle reader than ones made 3 or 4 years ago. Much more user friendly
0,"I HATE this machine. First, I specifically asked the salesperson if I could connect to the internet. He assured me I could. It does not. Second complaint is that you can't just press the book and delete it. You have to go to Amazon to do this. I hated it so much I gave it away."
1,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR STREAMING .THE PRICE IS THE BEST PART .IT IS EASY TO SETUP.I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT.
1,"This was a great christmas gift, for the person that I bought it for. They asked Santa for it, and it looks like he came through again this year. It may be a while before I get a thank you, cause it came from santa---- Check your santa mail box. they might say how much they liked it."
0,"I purchased this tablet for my daughter and within 5 days after purchasing it, the screen went completely blank. It wasn't dropped and didn't get wet. It is also very limited to apps you can download on it. Many apps wouldn't work after being installed. I would NOT recommend buying this tablet."
1,Not much to say except that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
1,Very great tablet for a cheap price I love it I will recommend it to others
1,I bought this tablet because it was very inexpensive and the right size and fit for my daughter...
1,Good tablet which is child friendly and somewhat durable
1,I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design.
1,i bought for my niece and really amazing and working very good.
1,"This little tablet is just what I needed. Easy to use and functional with a good display. For cloud access, reading email, internet, using apps, music and photo storage what more can you ask for. Expandable memory this really has nearly everything you could want on an inexpensive device. Don't worry ads don't get in the way they are only one the first screen."
1,THE BEST TABLET THAT I BOUGHT and the best gifffft
1,"Great product, I bought one last year and loved it. Had to buy another for the guest room. Having Alexa makes it even easier to use."
1,great product used by all ages and everyone love it
0,"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
1,"love it, I use it for everything. sound quality is really good."
1,"So far the 1yo loves it. I thought it would be too much, but no."
1,My son always wants to play on my tablet. This was an excellent deal. Best Christmas gift!
1,I bought three of these tablets for my grandkids for Christmas. My wife had 0ne and she rally loved it.
1,It was a present for my daughter and I am in love with the product. I want one for me
1,"Great little box, easy to install and use. You do need to create an amazon account. Great resolution and image."
1,This thing works very well with my smart home and it has a lot of skills.
1,"Having had several models of Kindle readers, I can say that this is the best yet and is definitely worth the extra cost."
1,This is a good tablet for the money. Recommended for first time tablet owners.
1,Very easy to use by a 2 year old. Love how I can limit the time use.
1,"It's an awesome product. The sound is pretty impressive from such a small cylinder. News, sports, weather, jokes, and nearly whole house control. We love it!"
1,"My daughter is learning so much from the games on this device, my wife was glad I bought it."
1,The Fire is an amazing product at an amazing price!
1,"Its a good product . Speed , price and apps are apt"
1,This thing is AWE... wait for it... SOME. Don't like cable? Buy this thing immediately!
1,great size and shape clear screen easy to use has a lot of options
1,"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
1,I absolutely love my firestick. The possibilities are limitless.
1,I love my echo does everything I need it to do. Go amazon
1,"We have iPads and a surface, but my wife wanted something to read on. This fit the ticket perfectly. We haven't had any problems with it in the first 90 days. Everything works great."
1,"This tablet was a gift for my nephew who is 10, great gift where he can use it to get on the internet. It works well for what he is using it for."
1,Purchased on Black Friday Deal. 71 yr. old mom loves it and uses daily for reading.
1,I love my Firebox along with Alex I can ask almost anything and Alex will let me know
1,This is the second Amazon fire 7 tablet I've purchased. I haven't seen anything that compares to it for the price
1,Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.
0,I cant comment much on the operation of this device as it was bought as a gift. But the price is super and past experience with Kindle readers promices you will get a excellent bang for the buck.
1,Received the Alexa for my birthday and the whole family loves it. Going to purchase a few Dots for the kids so they stop taking my Alexa from the kitchen.
1,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
1,I bought the Fire for my wife after she started getting headaches in the evening doing Facebook and email on her iPhone. The larger screen on the Fire makes it easier on her eyes and her headaches are gone.
1,"Looking for a present for that young professional or graduate, this is great. They love technology."
1,"much better than previous/first tablet. Has excellent graphics, reasonable fast, and mostly intuitive. Had to add Google, and difficult to add apps that are not in the Amazon store."
1,very good e-reader. like the back light very much. very light for carrying around.
1,I already had one of these in my living room where we watch TV most of the time and bought a second one for my theater room....I Love it!
1,"Amazon's know for there tablets. Mine works great, good wifi and memory. I love the quad-core processor, great screen, crisp and clear.Comfortable and easy to use. 10/10"
1,I bought this for a friends 12 year old..he loves it! much like a regular tablet but added all the bonus features of having an amazon product! and it came with6 months of geek squad..couldnt have got any better.
0,"I think that this tablet is only good for reading books. It's not very fast, so you won't be able to do anything else."
0,"Camera has poor resolution, charging time is slow."
1,Works flawlessly. Interface is much faster than the stick.
1,This is a great product. Great sound. My entire family enjoys this
1,"My granddaughter like's her tablet, she has learning a lot.the case is durable and I was glad that the case came in pink."
1,The Amazon Fire TV is excellent for streaming video. Also a great platform to install Kodi.
1,"Good value tablet, make a good remote for fireTV. Often cheaper at other vendors though."
1,Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
1,"I have two of these and three Fire TV sticks. Both products are great. The customization, the store, availability of streaming services, access to Prime benefits, Alexa, the voice remote, these are all great things on both products. Having the ability to plug in external storage and Ethernet makes me a happy user. The additional processing power is noticeable in response time of the interface. I also have a variety of Apple TVs. I appreciate dev access to these devices but that is definitely a poweruser thing."
1,"Nice Toy. In the future, when I get more accessories to work with it, will be more rewarding."
1,"It doesn't always know what you are saying but for the most part it picks it up pretty well. I hope it gets better with time for the amount of things you can ask it to do, but for now it is totally worth it!"
1,"Being familiar with the Kindle tablets, I knew these would be a great gift for my nephews. The price was unbeatable for such a great product! Now that Christmas has passed and they have been given their tablets, they love everything about them. We are living in a digital age and these tablets will give them a great start managing their time and abilities to navigate through the operating systems for it."
1,We bought this to have all of our streaming services in one place. It does exactly that. Awesome for logging in and taking it with you.
1,This is a good tablet if you aren't expecting ipad quality. A great tablet for price. Good for surfing the web and netflix.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. I tried it with her at her home, and wow, accurate, clear, and loud. Only draw back is that the music selection can only come from amazon prime, not your own catalog, at least that is what I am told. Other than that it really works great"
1,I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.
1,"It took awhile to get this Kindle as it was out of stock, but it was worth the wait. It is easy to use and the text is very clear. I have had a Kindle before but this model is so much better. Most enjoyable."
1,I love the camera quality and secured apps available for download. But if you're looking for specific apps research to see if it's available first. Had to return to get an android tablet for gaming purposes
0,I got it because I wanted to be able to use it to download books for college classes. It is slow and seems to freeze up a bit when I try to use it. I have a 64g memory card in it and have most of my stuff saved to it. I wouldn't think that would cause it to run slow.
1,"A friend loves hers & told me I would love it, I do"
1,This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful.
1,This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.
1,awesome speaker and alexa is very helpful. I bought it for the bluetooth speaker and alexa is a bonus.
1,My 10 year old absolutely loves his fire. He can download his favorite games as well as his favorite books to read.
1,Great Amazon - Fire TV i am very satisfied with my unit
0,"Bought this tablet this Thanksgiving for $35.Tablet is too slow and apps doesn't responds properly, tried doing the updates over wifi to see if that resolves the issue but that didn't work too.Commons apps like Gmail, Facebook, Messenger or browser related are dying very frequently and sometimes doesn't even boots up, also, coming from Android you will feel that you have landed up in a deserted apps land.A good tablet for kids but adults can't rely on it !"
1,This tablet is a well made tablet. Be sure to get a sd card as the memory is not great. The Amazon underground with totally free games and apps is worth the purchase alone. You do not need Amazon Prime subscription service to enjoy this little tablet. Go on and purchase one for 50.00 you wont regret the purchase.
1,"I had a Kindle a couple of years ago and didn't like it, but with the great price and wanting to get another tablet, I bought this one and am very glad. I had some trouble setting it up due to password issues but now it's easy and offers lots to do and for sure more for me to learn. I highly recommend this product, maybe for someone starting out. It does as much as an IPad in an easy to carry package, great photos, email, everything, and the price cannot be beat."
1,Great product very useful and conventional. Alexa is the Best
1,"Fast processor, excellent interface. You need this if you are cutting the cord."
1,"My son loves it! So many great games, audiobooks and apps for kids, and we love the timer feature so we can set time for him to let him play before bedtime. Very worth it!"
1,"With some technical savvy, you can quickly have the core of home automation installed and grow over time. The link to my Amazon Prime account gives me access to some 2M songs. I can control lights and temperature via links to my Nest thermostat and Philip Hue."
1,"I purchased this as a gift, but have owned three myself. Hands down the best reading experience. I LOVE my Kindle!That said, this version of their software lost some functions in terms of listing and collections that I really miss. Improvements always have a price, I guess."
1,"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
1,This is my second Kindle reader. My first one wasn't back lite. I love that I can read outside in the sunshine or in bed with no light on. It is a great item if you like to read. I haven't bought an actual book in years!
1,Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
1,"Was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own Ipad or the kindle. I'm so glad that I picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. She loves it too!"
1,"I bought this tablet for my three year old niece. It was easy to set up for her, and she loves it. I also purchased the Kids Free case, to protect it."
1,It works great!
0,Does not pick up WiFi very well; apps take longer to download...However regular software apps work great!
1,This product is a great learning tool for my 4yr old toddler. It's has the option for kid mode or regular tablet mode.
1,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.
1,"Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight."
1,Great product! This is the best smart device that we have bought in so many years. The best of it is Alexa is getting better every day. We are having fun with Alexa every day me she became one of the best friends of my wife.
1,easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon.
1,"Great device to use when you want to work on small things that doesn;t require a computer. It's portable and is capable of streaming with out problem. Battery life seems to go quickly, but real quick to recharge"
1,Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
1,"My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
1,"Having owned each of the previous Kindle readers, this one is without a doubt the best of the bunch. I highly recommend that the serious reader consider this device. Do note that this is a Reader, not a tablet. Grab an iPad or Kindle Fire for your tablet needs but get this to read books. The high dot-per-inch count makes it easy on the eyes, as does the evenly-distributed light. Superb device!"
1,this is my favorite set-top box. You have all the same functions as the others but you can also side load apps as well such as Kodi and emulators to play old school games like Super Mario and Zelda. If you have amazon prime the Alexa feature is pretty awesome as well finding music on prime and getting random information.
1,Really great piece very good quality and very clear
1,My kid is enjoying the product. It serves the needs for her. Wish she could watch some of the Prime movies when she's on FreeTme.
1,Bought as a gift and very easy to use. Everyone was happy!
1,"I was tired of the insane cable bills, so I bought the fire tv.........goodbye cable, fire tv meets all my needs"
1,"Great sound for a little device. Definitely expensive, but if you can get it on sale I would definitely recommend this device. But, you must have wi-fi in your home."
1,awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
1,Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
1,It does more than I thought it would. I have automated many parts of my home and it is more then just a gimmick.
1,Great tablet and very user friendly. Great to read off of and surf the web
1,The product was very easy to use straight from the box.
1,This was a gift for my sister and she love it she going purchase one for her daughter
1,"This was brought for husband, he wore out his first kindle. Excellent value."
1,We can do many things with this Fire. All best entertainment that our family can have from it. Amazon products is better and better day by day!!! Keep it up like that.
1,With amazon prime I was able to create a huge play list. My Echo also turns on lights in some of the most inconvenient areas. Alexa keeps me informed on news weather and sports.
0,I like the $39.99 firestick better. This one does not have all the stuff the other one has and the sales clerk saud that it did.
0,"It wouldn't connect to internet. Tried at home, at a couple of Wi-Fi spots and at the store where I bought it."
1,Works perfectly.
1,My FIrst Kindle and already loving it. Very Lightweight
1,Bought the echo for my husband. He love's it. Its an amazing piece of technology.
1,"I have only had it for a few weeks, so still have a lot of things to learn, but it was incredibly simple to set up and figure out how to use. It's pretty addictive too."
1,"I like this tablet for the price I paid it is easy to use, setup, and I like the way it looks."
1,The kindle is my favorite tablet for reading books
1,works great for what I need it for. Great size for traveling! and great battery life! For only paying $35 bucks you definitely get your money's worth
1,"I'd been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time. Best Buy had a Deal-of-the-Day on these and I thought, what the heck, here's a table radio you can talk to. It does a whole lot more than that, and there is quite a learning curve, not so much in how to use it, but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful. The sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station I can play tons of stuff from Prime Music online and add skills whenever I need them from the skills store. (All the skills I've seen so far are free so ""store"" is kind of a loose term.) It responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than Siri or Cortana. With all the alarms, timers, shipment trackers, wall street reports, entertainment updates, etc, it's like living with a gifted, less snooty concierge. I like it and would buy another if this one ever broke."
1,This is a great product that is also a lot of fun.
1,I would buy another one for the priceGood product
1,I bought this for my son to use and he loves it!!!
1,This product works awesome for getting current movies and tv shows. We live in a rural area so we have some buffering issues which is sometimes frustrating but overall this is a great product and has provided access to many more viewing options
1,I use it to keep her busy with educational games and she loves being on it!
1,Great media player for the kids... video streaming is great and fun games to keep them occupied. Expand the memory with an SD card
1,great product. I have 4 android fire TV boxes in my house. I love it. easy to setup
1,I've had the Fire 1st gen and Fire stick. All have been great. The added power on this 2nd gen is great.
1,Fire tv is easy to set up and navigate. As seniors we were concerned about the ease of use.
1,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
1,This unit works great. We ditched cable and this is a great alternative. We have had no problems with this unit.
1,"We love our new echo. Strong sound quality. Weather updates, alarm, internet details, and easy to use."
1,Great product we are really enjoying it. Easy to set up instructions.
1,I had been waffling recently on whether to upgrade my first gen paperwhite to the newer one. I'm glad I finally did. The resolution is much better than my old one.
1,"I bought this for my gf for her bday, and she loves."
1,"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!"
1,I can use my tablet all time and your conecctions is very good
1,"Great addition to my older ""dumb"" Samsung TV. I'm an Amazon Prime member so it made sense to purchase this to watch Prime Videos. Another great feature is the ability to load and use Playstation Vue app to stream cable television which has allowed me to discontinue my overpriced satellite TV service. My only con, was that the provided voice remote sometimes would lose connectivity and the buttons were rendered useless. Resetting the unit helps, but very annoying. Luckily, there's a Fire TV app for mobile devices for remote control. Overall, I do recommend this product."
1,"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!"
1,Haven't gotten many devices connected but my thermostats are which is awesome to do.
1,"I love my fire amazon tv box it's fast reliable and cool to have ,I would highly recommend getting one"
1,"Handles good, just the right size, appearance is great"
1,"The Echo is definitely a must. It has great sound quality, very easy to use and is a lot of fun to have at parties. It is compact and very structurally sturdy. I recommend the Echo to everyone."
1,Excellent product. I Upgraded to the Fire HD 10 10.1
1,This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.
1,"I'm on a year's assignment in LA. I've had Amazon Prime for years, but now it's essential to keep track of my programming."
1,"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music."
1,Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
1,After a lot of research I purchased the fire tv. As far as t know it is one of the only if not only streamers out today that after its latest update can force dd+ to downcovert to regular dd 5.1 over HDMI great feature for soundbar and legacy receiver owners. I do not have a 4K tv so that is not important to me. All else works great out of the box this unit had a lot if bugs in the beginning but except for lack of vudu I love it. Being a prime member also helps.
1,Good item and also good price. My son and I like this!!
1,Very good product and works perfect with my Samsung TV
1,Installed the Kodi program on this & it works better then Netflix - I get to watch the latest shows for FREE.
1,Was initially concerned that it would take a lot to set up the Echo but it was easy to get it all going and very easy to use. Really glad we went ahead and made the purchase.
1,"Worked right out of the box, If I need another one I will buy one of these."
0,Needs to have some hardcopy instructions in the package..
1,i bought his for my son and he loves it it fits right in his hands and easy to navigate
1,I like the Kindle Paperwhite because the backlighting makes it easier to read than the first one.
1,Nothing but the best way to read books. Love the way it looks and the fact that I can read anywhere!
1,"Great item , can use like a regular computer, facebook ,email , Netflix an so on. Only problem websites that use flashplayer,won't play videos."
1,"I love it,that keeps them out of my living room so that they can watch tv in their room"
1,If you want an upgrade this product is for you. Great media streamer
1,I bought the product as a gift for a family member who was able to set uo and start using the product with minimal or no instructions. This is so important for those who might be less computer savvy!
1,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent."
1,I upgraded to the Paperwhite from an older Kindle. It's definitely an improvement over my last one and it brings some modern technology to a familiar user interface. You can't really beat what you get for the price.
1,Great for cord cutting. Just needs a little cleaning up to do. Sorting through the content can be a little confusing.
0,It's ok best for kids I think or if you in to reading books
1,I love this device. I won't have to worry about cable anymore.
1,To be able to just ask anything and get an instant answer. Pretty neat stuff.
1,Bought for my granddaughter age 5 for Xmas. She loves it.
1,"Works great with my free amazon media. Movies,music, and Aps. are great."
1,bought both the echo dot and the echo home the tech responds to commands from everyone in the house including the kids but the echo search engine needs a lot of work
1,This is one of the best purchase I have gotten in the last 7 months. You can ask Alexsa anything and she will give you a correct answer. I have also have the Echo controlling my heating system and lights. A must have in the house.....
1,Simple tablet with all the basics. Worth it for the price!
1,"The Amazon Fire TV box is probably the best streaming box out there. It has a hardwired Ethernet connection if you need it and a fast processor. It has Alexa for voice searches and it supports just about every streaming service out there plus a built-in Slingbox client. Most other streamers that support slingbox are actually screencasting from a smartphone or tablet. Plus it is very easy to sideload applications so you can run about anything. We have crowded building with a lot of WiFi signals stepping on each other, so the hardwired connection is good for reliable streaming. It has Bluetooth, so you can pair devices with it, I think the remote is actually Bluetooth too, so you can stash the box out of sight."
1,"I purchased the Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. It took her a few hours to get used to it. Now, I cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work."
0,"I own a high end system with AppleTV 3 and Chromcast media players for Netflix and the likes. I purchased fire tv for 4K. As with other devices I thought I could configure it and forget it. This is not the case with Fire TV. Remote control requires constant attention. Open the back play with batteries, but battery cover back on. Constantly! HDMI port does not work with HDMI switch. It is the only device that I own that does not play well with my switch. Internet connection is poor. Start receiving video won't load errors after a week. I thought perhaps WiFi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue, so I tried wired connection and got same error. Tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help. Device is very hot. It is on constantly. No automatic method of turning off when not being used.On the plus side, the interface is the best I seen on any media player. Beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured. Alexia rocks but limited to basic commands. Amazon Prime integration is excellent as you might expect. Beautiful looking device. After about 10 days I got fed up and returned it. I'll wait for AppleTV to integrate 4K. Hopefully that will be soon."
0,It was only forty-nine bucks - - how can anyone complain too much? It's fine. It's adequate. No problems. Smallish screen. The missus uses it to sit on the couch and look at her Facebook. She says it's okay.
1,"My review is not a review of the device as much as my opinion on which product to choose when trying to decide between this and Google home.Google home is the closest competition in this landscape and its still lacking in comparison to Alexa.All of the interesting features of Google home are non existent or slowly being released. Using these features as a selling point is disingenuous.More than that Google home constantly has trouble detecting my voice and doing any of the assistant commands. In the same environment the echo dot with budget hardware had better success rate. When it did detect it the time to action was x2 as long as Google home is much more ""chatty""."
1,Got this as a gift for my mom for mothers day. Its simple and easy enough to use and provides great performance for its price range.
1,I own a Fire tablet and bought this for my grandson for Christmas as he always uses mine. He loves to play games on it! He is 7 and it is easy for him to use.
1,Great for a good read or binge watching in your bedroom. Slim size tablet so it fits perfectly in your palm
1,Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
1,I got this for my kids and they love it its not slow very fast easy to use user friendly
1,"Once hooked up, great product. Be sure to have a router large enough to deliver streaming tv."
1,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
1,We love it.. so easy to install and use. Fun! Great sound. Perfect gift for anyone.
1,"fast, easy to use, would recommend to anyone, !!!!"
1,"Everyone love asking Alexa questions. She has earned her place in the middle of the livingroom now. She listens to your commands, plays songs, reads books, and even controls electronic equipments around the house for you. I sometimes wish Alexa could be portable to follow me everywhere. ;)"
1,"Get Amazon Prime movies, Netflix, YouTube, but Apps are very limited. No Facebook. Can't get any good games that I know of and I don't need the Premium Movie channels because I get them with my cable. Enables me to use my older TV, which is not a Smart TV to access these services. Good deal. Might get another one for the guest room which has no cable box and the same type of tv."
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo for my husband as a birthday gift. He had been eyeing it for quite some time, but it definitely seemed a little steep for what is essentially a Bluetooth speaker. But...oh were we wrong! The Echo is one of the coolest tech products we have ever had. It makes me feel like we are living in some futuristic home. Other than being an excellent Bluetooth speaker (which it is), Alexa sets timers, alarms, streams music through many different apps, tells you the status of your orders on Amazon, etc. We love it so much that we find ourselves searching for other products that pair with Alexa to enable it to do even more for us. We just bought our 7 year old the Echo Dot for his birthday and he absolutely loves asking Alexa questions and playing music. Very unique product and I can't wait to see what new things Alexa can do over time!"
1,A great way to start cutting the cable cord. Might have to buy another.
1,"Easy to setup, more than acceptable performnces. I use the device to check emails, play, surfing the web and I never have any problems.Excellent price."
1,We like our new Alexa but wish I had a tutorial to teach me how to maximize its use.
1,This product works very well and represents an extremely useful piece of artificial intelligence.
1,So much easier to read on this. The light helps too. Although having a nice hard cover in the hands is still nice
1,I am greatly satisfied with this tablet. And the price is great too.
1,"The tablet is great! Easy to use, better than the Galaxy that I have."
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is a great e-reader. I did tons of research before getting one. For me, I was trying to choose between the regular Kindle and this one. The major difference there is the back-lighting. Holy cow, I simply cannot get across how much I've used the backlighting. I mean, I can't even imagine at this point NOT getting this one over the regular Kindle. I've even taken to reading before bedtime, in the dark, and then putting the Kindle down when I'm sleepy. Seriously, if you're trying to figure out which one to get, the Paperwhite is definitely the way to go, especially because of the adjustable back-lighting. Man alive, what a great purchase."
1,"Works as suppos to do, buy it is ok, no worries do it"
1,"We love the Echo. Great sound for music, turning lights on and off and now have it connected to our Roomba. We also ordered the battery for it as to move it outside for the music."
1,"You will not regret this purchase! The kindle holds a charge for more than a week, is super light weight, easy on the eyes, and allows you to define words with the point of a finger! It even adds defined words to a vocabulary list, so you can review them!"
1,"I will start with the disclaimer, I am not an Amazon Prime member. I have a feeling this tablet really roars around within the AP environment. Instead, I purchased it to watch YouTube videos, Netflix and Hulu shows, read a few digital books, and maybe other stuff down the road. Yes, there is an app for Hulu and Netflix and YouTube. But the Netflix app stopped seeing my memory card and a reinstall didn't fix it. This means I can't download videos to the 64 GB card I bought.I figured, I should be able to move files back and forth - but that doesn't work. No way to move the content to the card. So I have 64 GB unusable for Netflix and am stuck loading on the 8GB internal memory. When I take this thing on the road, I will have to rely on wifi to replenish titles along the way.The picture is good, though, bright enough and clear. Sound is just ok and I am disappointed by the top volume through both the speaker and the headphone jack - it barely cuts above the fans from my AC. I plan on adding a Bluetooth speaker at some point, but am guessing I will run into a similar issue - how to get more volume.At $50, I am plenty happy with the device, but it should use Android aps better. I know Amazon wants me on prime, but I should still get the best experience possible."
1,I purchased this for my 6yr old niece and she absolutely love it.
1,Works very well as a cheap youtube tablet. Would recommend.
1,Best recommendation for a tablet that does everything you need it to do. Expandable memory is a great upgrade to the Fire!
1,They advertise zero lag time. Does still need to buffer
1,It's the second one I've bought. I highly recommend it to anyone.
1,The unit is well made and has tons of features for children six years and over. Was amazed at the low price and how easy it to handle even for a six year old!
1,"I will rate this Amazon Tap a five stars when the application to make the Alexa commands become remote, instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself."
1,I think it's a awesome device if you like tok stream.
1,If you enjoy content from everywhere and have Amazon prime this is worth it !!One word. KODI
1,easy to operate and has good color. use it when out and about.
1,"Cable is too expensive. Especially when you can buy this and get more than you ever expected. You can expand the memory at will, you can watch literally anything, and although the remote is awful, there's an iPhone app that allows you to toss that unreliable remote in the trash. Get this thing, thank me later."
1,My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school.
0,"20 for a 5w, 1A wall charger! That deal is right up there with the 30 Hdmi cables best buy wants to sell you.Here is what you do, find an old cell phone charger laying around somewhere that says 5W, 1A(1000mA ) and use it. You can safely use up to 5.25 watts and anything between .5 and 1 amp (500mA-1000mA).If you don't have an extra cell phone charger lying around just buy a well reviewed power adapter with the above specifications that connects to your Kindle (micro USB). They can be found for under 10 locally or through Amazon."
1,These are great for my teens to use at school. Now that their school uses online activities.
1,"Christmas present for husband,we both love the echo can't wait to download apps"
1,"This tablet does everything that was advertised, but only a fraction of the cost! A great buy!"
1,This tablet makes for the perfect gift! Highly recommend
1,"Amazon Fire TV is so much better than cable or satellite TV. If you have a good internet connection, this is the best!"
1,"1st Amazon Fire, I love it! Best investment for my tv."
1,The amazon echo is a fun and easy to use device. Sound quality for music is excellent and Alexa answers questions easily. Definitely a must have if you subscribe to prime as you have lots of music choices. Highly recommend the echo.
1,i upgraded from an older kindle that wasn't backlit. The quality and ease of use is much better and I love the backlit feature!
1,"I've owned a fire stick, chromecast, Apple TV and Roku, This is by far my favorite device for cutting cords!"
1,Hard to say anything wrong about this product. Works great.
1,great experience using this e reader! never going back to books
1,I like what I've done so far. I am pleased with it.easy to use and read.
1,Great tablet for kids and adults.Great for price.
1,This is the third I have had to buy/ They seem to only work for a year before needing to be replaced. I have the warranty but no patience for the replacement to be mailed to me with all the forms.
1,I bought this for my daughter who is 6 and it has weathered the storm
0,Pro's GPS accurate--easy to set-upCons small screen--does not count stairs adequately--would not push notification to my Samsung 7 edge
1,"Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night."
1,Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.
1,Purchased for my 6 year old he loves it works great
1,Great! Fun! I wish it was wireless I understand the Tap is wireless but why wouldn't everything be wireless.
1,great item helpful; staff just what was looking for
1,Very Rice Product and My Wife loves it. It is a great git for book lovers.
1,"For $50 this table was a no brainer. It's fantastic. Light, good battery life and I get the apps that I want/need.I am not a fan of the Silk browser, but I didn't buy this to surf. I bought it to read books and watch Netflix. It works perfectly for that. It's so good, I bought 2."
1,This is a great value. Comfortable size for reading.
1,I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
1,This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
1,Two different friends (households) told us how much they ejoy the Echo so we purchased ours!!! It is fun to use near our computer and we love it!!! We are telling other friends about our experience!!!
1,Can't really speak for myself because I bought it as a gift. The recipient enjoys it. No complains
1,Bought my husband this for Father's Day and he loves it! We even went back to get the smaller version for another area of our home and another for my father. I wish this hooked up to other Bluetooth items like the dot does
1,My Son is very happy with his giftlistening to music and asking question to Alexa all the time...!
1,Okay new look is less appealing but seems to work okay
1,"Since I am a prime member, this fits perfectly into our tv watching lineup."
1,Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.
1,The fire tablet is a good products from amazon they can be used in so many ways. A great educational product for a child. It was easy to setup and start using.
1,"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music."
1,"This 8GB 7"" Kindle Fire Tablet is great and beats others which are more expensive. I bought one for my grandson and he loves it. Plus there are a ton of free apps from Amazon to use with it."
1,everyone has enjoyed this item. Great fun for the whole family.
1,"The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
1,"Excellent platform for enabling a variety of software applications. Faster processor than the fire stick, which helps against any potential buffering issues."
0,Bought it as birthday gift for my son. He didn't like it at first because he is ise to the Android system. He likes it more now that he's figured it out and for the price it's ok.
1,"I bought a couple of dots first since I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money. We enjoyed the dots so much, I bought us an Echo. The speakers are so much better on the Echo than on the Dots, which I already knew from reviews. I have it in my kitchen and can listen to all kinds of music while I am cooking. Echo will tell you jokes, news and weather as well.Very happy with this purchase."
1,I was looking at the Kindle and ended up buying the paperwhite for the backlighting which works great. The battery does last weeks as mentioned in the details. I wish I would have waited a few weeks to buy since they dropped the price.
1,I purchased this tablet fire 7 for my daughter and she really loved it.
1,Love my ECHO . Listening to my favorite station is great . It has a great sound.
1,If you like reading books this will make an awesome companion on your next vacation. The backlight is great too. You can read in complete darkness even if someone else is sleeping in the same room. I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It was one of the rare good gift ideas I've come up with :)
1,"My wife went on a cruise and when she came back found out she was replaced by Alexa... just kidding.Great sound for music, helps kids with homework, make grocery lists, weather and traffic, lots it can do. I got it for $88 on a surprise 1 day sale thru Best Buy."
1,I only use it for some apps and that's it. It's pretty nice
1,Easy to use and the large screen has wonderfully clear picture.
1,"I purchased 2 Fire tablets for my kids. They love them. I should have reserved the prior, due to the fact that they are use to the android network. So it's taking some getting use to but the work and function just fine no problems yet, especially for the price"
1,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen."
1,Fire Tv is fast . I recommend this to everyone ! All my co workers purchased them too
1,Great tablet. Very reliable. Only problem was the ads. But they didn't bother me too much. Overall a great buy.
1,i purchased the tablet for my son and he has pleasantly delighted with it up to this point.
1,"Fantastic, I use my fire tv everyday, I tell all my family & friends to buy one. For Christmas I bought them as gifts. This is a must have."
1,I quit cable all together and stream everything I watch using this box.
1,"I was previously using a first gen Nook e-reader. This is crisper, faster, and MUCH better battery life. Plus it goes on sale every once in awhile."
1,This compact device is easy to use and can be taken anywhere. It is a pleasure to have your favorite book with you when you have some down time.
0,"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
1,"It works good but have not used it that much, would recommend"
1,"The Amazon Echo works well. So well, in fact, that I haven't felt the need to use the remote very often. However, there are a few occasions when it is great: 1) When listening to music, getting the volume just right using voice commands can get annoying. The remote is quick, easy, and allows greater fine-tuning. 2) When there is a lot of background noise. The Echo is good, but sometimes has difficulty hearing correctly when I have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise. Speaking into the remote never fails (and also doesn't require you to say the wake word). 3) When in another room. I often listen to music on my Echo, even when in another room. Yelling across the house is disturbing, and doesn't always work, but the remote allows me to skip, pause, or turn off the music from my office or bedroom. It's also great for adding items to the shopping and to-do lists.If I lost my remote or, more likely, dropped it in the kitchen sink, I'd buy another without hesitation."
1,I bought 3 of these. They are great and very durable . . The price is amazing .
1,"I bought this Kindle for my 14-yr old daughter, Kennedy. She hates it so it's now mine! I love how small it is-fits in my handbag perfectly!"
1,Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets
1,Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one
1,"I love my Alexa! I renamed her Computer because of Star Trek. We have so much fun listening to music, playing games and telling her to clean the house with our Neato botvac or turn on the sprinklers with our Rachio irrigation controller. As we learn more cool things this personal assistant can do the happier I am we purchased one. We like it so much we purchased another for our bedroom and a Dot for our daughters room. They work together as an intercom system too so no more yelling for one another or texting, admit it, you do it too, we can now just drop in and talk to one another. I am planning to continue purchasing items that Alexa can control and look forward to the advancement in personal assistant technology. So many things she can do already!!! I highly recommend getting 1 or 2 or 3!!!"
0,"This charger FRIED my Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Samsung Galaxy J7. DO NOT plug your other devices up to it!!! It easily comes detached from the Fire tablet but does charge it. I'm just very unhappy that it killed my other devices. There are young children in my home and they know the difference between Apple and Android charging tips. So they will use any available charging cable they find when needed."
1,Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
1,Exactly what I needed. Didn't want to settle for a generic off brand charger. Thanks to Best Buy I didn't have to.
1,Great little tablet. Exactly what we needed for our daughter. It works great around the house and she can play games while we roadtrip. Perfect for our needs.
1,"This device has changed my marriage for the good!! Me and my wife have been glued to the tube, cuddling every night..."
1,Great addition for Kindle
1,I purchased this so that I could use Skype to check on my dogs during the day. I had to download an app that makes the Fire stay on otherwise it goes to sleep. Once I had that app installed and Skype doing the Auto-Answer it worked well. Overall if I was going to use this as a reader or mini tablet it looks like a good product. The screen is bright and sharp.
1,"23 year old with many special needs loves this tablet. I replaced her old laptop computer with this tablet which meets her needs better. She mostly uses Facebook and games, and this tablet is more portable everywhere for her."
1,"At this low price compared to competitors, it's a convenient solution for a variety of applications. I keep it in the living room as a controller, having loaded the Harmony app to control activities and devices via the Harmony hub."
1,Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.
1,"Alexa has many cool features. I'm enjoying learning how to ""teach"" her things as well as identifying ways to allow her to share content and information."
1,This has expanded my viewing and allowed me to see movies that I had forgotten.
1,Reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly
0,I had trouble with the device interfering with my internet connection. It would cause my wifi to disconnect. I could not toggle between the device and other devices. After I figured it out it works fine
1,Very easy to set up and to use. I have not used the voice control yet but will soon
1,My son loves everything about it the songs the games and music videos
1,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up."
1,This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark
1,I purchased this for my father for Christmas and it is slick and super fast on his 4K television. You can mod and side load apps. Otherwise you would have to be tied into the Amazon eco-system and have Prime in order to enjoy it.
1,I love my kindle so much. It has a great screen clarity. Also the price was on point.
1,I bought 3 of these for my children for christmas and they love them! Great tablet for game apps they have had a blast playing theirs! So far we haven't had any technical issues such as lagging etc. I would highly recommend this to a mom of kids that love to play games this is a perfect purchase for you!
1,I bought this for my 13 year old niece who has autism and she loves it. Great price and great tablet for kids.
1,My kids love it as they can ask Alexa to play Kids Bop radio on Sirius.
1,Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.
1,My parents love their new Kindle Fire HD's!!!!!!!!!
1,This is the second Amazon Dot purchased and it keeps getting better
1,Bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts. Does everything it needs to do.
1,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother. It took him a minute to get used to it because he previously used an iPad. However, with the help of YouTube, he quickly got it up and running and has been enjoying it."
1,This new reader is light weight and easy to use. It fits conveniently in my purse.
1,Added it as a gift to my son's already expensive x mas gifts. He's 21 and loves it! Bought one for my nephew too and he loves it!
1,Setup is extremely easy. Access to numerous movies and apps. Streaming works great. Perfect option for people who want to stop paying for cable. Ensure the software is updated after first setting up your Amazon account. Few Cons: Only able to use the voice search option on the main screen.Must reboot occasionally if WiFi connection fails.
1,I've used a Nook for years but I'm beginning to like this tablet better. Charges very quickly.
1,I was a great price for a tablet! I would buy this tablet again.
0,"I bought this Fire TV 3 months ago. One day, out of the blue, it stopped working. Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless. Not a happy camper here!!!"
0,I Ive used this for a month now. It works great 75 percent of the time. Alexa doesnt always understand you. The mic doesnt hear you when your 20 feet away.
1,Love it for the ease of using it and for the books I can read on it. Great buy!
1,My daughter loves her tablet. I couldn't have made a better purchase.
1,very fast and kid friendly for my young son gifts.
1,Does exactly what it is supposed to. 5 stars if it were a little less $$ and had bitstream audio out for true dolby atmos decoding on the receiver end.
1,Love alexa. She does some much. Great sound level for music
1,This thing is amazing. The possibilities are endless.
1,"my husband wanted this item. from what I later found out, you have to also buy different componets to do certain things. didn't expect that."
1,Bought this as a gift for hubby on his birthday. It is so easy to use. Hours of enjoyment
1,Very easy to use. Great multiple uses for such a low price. I truly enjoy this and I use each day more than my desktop computer.
1,Bought it for my students to use. It is not a great resolution but it's great for reading books.
1,Bought these for my boys and they love it read books play games
1,Highly recommend. Battery is perfect. Light weight too!
1,I have a older kindle.. It dosent have a back light. My old one still works great but I wanted the back light. Love my new paper white kindle..
1,"I already own a Nvidia Shield but needed a cheaper option for my sons room to run Netflix and Kodi. The Amazon Fire TV runs both great, no lag and looks great."
1,the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised.
0,When I first got it was great until it stopped charging and wouldn't turn back on
1,This is a great tablet for my gra ds kids Christmas presents
0,"I ordered the Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders however, what I received is nothing like what is pictured. I received a charger cord that states LG Electronics and Verizon Accessory. I am not certain that these are the same item."
1,"We had an older Kindle that needed to be upgraded. This is the same quality for less than half the price!! Love it and has a camera, our old one did not."
1,"They love kindle. Ease of downloading the books they love and the battery life is so long, they just love it. Kindle transformed the way people carry books (reading). This is a light weight kindle, excellent display and awesome battery power. I would highly recommend for kids/ family/ everyone who loves to read a lot."
1,"I got this for ky 3 year old and she loves it. She has dropped it a fews times, once outside and it just bounced. I also love that I can set restrictions on play time, I can have it where this is no play time until a certain number of minutes of reading time has been completed. I don't have set times of the day that she can even get on it"
1,"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
1,My mother loves her tablet. She has been playing with it on a daily!
1,Good gift for someone. Got this for my girlfriends mom for xmas.

It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!
1,"I purchased two of these tablets and I absolutely love them! Super ""snappy"" with response time with hardly and lag. Easy to charge as well as install any apps you may want. Streams videos very well and for the price point it's a great buy. Highly recommended!"

1,Awesome within budget tablet.Great display & battery.

1,"We love our Echo! We use it to control our Hue Smart Bulbs in several rooms, listen to loads of music, get the weather forecast, add things to our Google calendar, make a shopping list ( that Alexa will email to you) and are still adding ""skills""all the time. The voice recognition is impressive. We like this so much we bought an Echo Dot for our bedroom"

1,Gave this to my son who breaks everything and so far has lasted through a couple drops. Easy to use and upload content.
1,"My wife had a Nook e-reader that was getting old and also used her iPhone 5 for reading. I thought it would be a very good reader for her and she loves it, along with the other capabilities the tablet offers. She has been very happy with it and you cannot beat the price for the features the tablet offers."
1,"Love the Echo, great addition to the house. Will do everything you need."
1,"In the past I used Google for information that I needed, but now I just ask Alexa! It's more versatile than Siri and it's ready to go just my saying her name. Yes, it's a little bit of a toy, but then what electronics aren't?"
0,Well primarily I was going. To for a Samsung galaxy but for the price I went with this kindle for my daughter to use I do like the parental control features I just wish Amazon was a full android device instead of limitations to app markets I can't even get Google play. Unless you jail break it. Well for what it does it works fine just not the top of the list.
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it
1,"Based on what everyone says about this item , I went out and bought it. And I must say , it's awesome. I use it constantly and it now controls the lights in my living room, as well as an item in my kitchen."
1,"The price on this is great. There are a couple of issues I have with my Kindle but I think it's me not the device. Sometimes when I shut it off I have to hold down the power button as the box that comes up that says ok or cancel does not work for me. The other problem I have is sometimes it does not go back to where I left off in a book. I took it to the store and the tech I had look at it did not have these problems. Other that that I love it. I can travel with it instead of my bulky lap top and have access to my email, movies and books. I purchased a case for it that sets it up so I don't have to hold it and that made me like it even more."
1,I bought it as gift to my neiece and she liked it.
1,my husband purchased a Fire tablet for me for my birthday I liked it so much I purchased one for him for a Christmas gift
1,"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !"
1,This tablet has been great for my 8 yr old son. It has an expandable memory. Charges fast. Very durable!
1,"Can't go wrong, for the price. I would certainly buy another one."
1,This item was not expensive but does a lot of more than tablets that cost more. I have purchased three with with two purchased last year with no issues
1,Awesome alternative to cable television. Being able to save $180 a month is worth the one time cost!
1,Great tablet for kids. They just love how simple it to use and great price.
1,I love my Kindle Paperwhite! It's easy to hold and and can store hundreds of books. The battery life can last weeks without charging. It's a must buy!
1,Easy to set up and easy to use. Need Amazon Prime account.
1,I love being able to choose what I want to watch!!
1,fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
1,"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use."
1,"Got this for my nieces, they use it daily! Works great with decent specs all around."
1,This is perfect for what I needed it for! Very nice product!
1,"I bought the tablets for the kids and they love then. They are able to play games, music, take pics and videos chat with them."
1,My wife loves this product. I never thought she would ever let go of paperback. But the ease of use and convenience when travel make this perfect for her because she loves read when we go to the beach.
1,"Easy to navigate, I love it despite the charging port. Charging port doesn't last very long though. Just purchased my second one."
1,"I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer."
1,Amazon updated their Fire TV box and this is a good option if you want a 4K upscale tv box.
1,"Great little speaker for music, also voice commands are a added plus."
1,Echo seems to be a great addition to the home. Seems to do a great job understanding you.
1,I love how easy and fun amazon echo has made my home..learning more everyday to really benefit from all its capabilities.
0,"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting"
1,For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.
1,"Been reading reviews for months. I decided to take a chance when I saw this on sale for $10 off and I am glad I did. I love to read and reading is easy and relaxing, I dont have to worry about losing my place and Amazon always offers up the next book in the series so I can continue reading with very little interruption. I know that some have complained about missing pixels on the screen, mine was just fine, maybe they have conquered the pixel problem. Highly recommended."
1,If you are a Amazon Prime member you will love this tablet. Even without Prime membership its still a nice tablet.
0,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
1,Unbelievable quality. Reader is even better at nighttime.
1,I got it as a gift for Mom. She loves it! It is not to complicated.
1,Great product for streaming your favorite movies and tv shows

1,"my grand kids talks to it, while doing there homework, school projects etc. i use it for the music. its great."
1,Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.
1,"Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon."
1,I purchased the item because I was cancelling Direct TV. I ended up going back to Direct TV but still use this device to easily access my Netflix and other channel apps.
1,I bought the echo after falling in love with the echo dot. The functionality of the speaker is fantastic and the sound quality is much better on this speaker than the dot. All in all a great speaker that's fun to use!
0,"It works great, its just not quite what I wanted for my daughter."
1,"The Amazon Kindle Fire is great for Amazon shopping. It offers games, music, movies and more that only the Kindle Fire, with Amazon, can offer. It truely meets a 4 star rating from me. The Kindle Fire has a very competitive price when considering other devices."
1,"Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it."
0,"I bought this tablet for my mother 12/7/15 as a Christmas gift, which I gave to her on the day 12/25. Just this week 1/8 she called to tell me that the tablet was not working right. I went to see her and check it out. Sure enough it wasn't functioning properly. I'm hoping that when I take it in, it will be replaced without a problem. I know sometimes items are just defective. That's why I would recommend this item. I've had my Kindle Fire for 3 years now with never a problem."
1,"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
1,Great price for a very basic tablet. Well worth the $$$
1,"Wonderful kindle, i have been reading a lot of things that I now can reach"

1,I love the echo use it everyday and would recommend it to anyone that enjoy fun toys great speaker also
1,I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
1,I purchased this for my 12 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She is over the moon happy with it! She needed no help in setting it up and using it. She used gift cards to load books and has been busy reading over Christmas vacation.
1,I love my tablet I can complaint about it that's the best deal for the year
1,I needed a tablet to use in a classroom setting and the Amazon Fire worked great.
1,"I purchased this item on Black Friday and it did not disappoint me! Due to recently losing my previous Kindle Fire HD, I was seeking to purchase another. I came across the Kindle Fire and had to have it. It has an awesome display, great price, user friendly, and it is the perfect size for travel. I love it and would recommend it to anyone!"
1,"Perfect for reading in sunny conditions, eliminates the storage need for books in the house"
1,Nice to have a charger that works quickly.
1,"This is really nice, my first kindle ereader, it fits in my purse. Love this!"
1,"Excellent product early and completely customizable can even play video games on it with the acquisition of the controls goodbye cable hello Amazon, oh and 4K also excellent"
1,Best box for all Apps. Has lots of options! Very fast
1,Great for learning apps and surfing internet for my 7 year old kid and also good protection
1,Great to use as a portable speaker to take around with you as you work outside as long as you have a wifi connection. I use it with Pandora and Amazon unlimited music.
1,"Can play almost any song on the spot, Does have some trouble with random questions, but overall it answers most."
1,My family enjoys the capabilities of the echo. Ask it anything and listen to anything anytime
1,Given as Christmas gift to my great little nephew ..
1,"easy to use for a handicapped person. i love it,,,,"
1,"I realize that many people will believe that this product is a cynical attempt to pump up Amazon's profits, and I'm sure it contributes, but don't deny yourself the serious fun this device will bring into your home!We originally bought this as a gift for my seeing-impaired mother-in-law in order for her to enjoy trivia, music and audio books with a hands-free interface. We didn't anticipate enjoying it ourselves so much that I'm not sure we're going to be willing to let it go!!!Setup is dead simple if you already have an Amazon Prime account and wireless Internet access. The audio quality and the unit's ability to cut through ambient noise in order to hear you are remarkable. The device is solidly built and has several nice ergonomic touches such as the rotating, color changing ring of lights that let you know you are being heard to the rotating volume ring at the top of the unit.It is amazing what the Echo can do. I'll leave the voyage of discovery up to each of you. Do get used to hearing ""Hmmm, I'm not sure about that"" or ""I'm still learning about...."" but I am certain that the Echo's cloud based ""brain"" will only get better with time.Do yourself a favor and get one of these, the whole family will enjoy it!"
1,This is a great streaming device. Definitely worth the extra cost compared to the fire stick. Apps open instantly and operates flawlessly.
1,love kindles and this one is the best one made by amazon. but expensive.
1,Got my amazon fire table and love it. It's really easy to use .battery last long
1,"Great table for a gift, easy to use, a lot of aplication, I will recommend"
1,My children love our new guest.. they love asking it everything and it has the answer
1,I bought this for my parents. It is easy to operate.
1,Good tablet for kids and easy to use. Great for everyone
1,"Less lag than the stick. Ethernet port option is nice. Not too much need though if you wont use extensively. If your a passive user go stick, if you'll everyday and even want to do gaming go box."
1,"I GOT MY ECHO AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT, ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE PURCHASED"
1,Need to have better info for special needs children. The kids utube is confusing but love the guarantee
1,Bought as a gift for dad. He loves it. Easy to use.
1,"I'm high-tech in most ways but have always been a traditionalist when it comes to books. I love the feel of paper in my hands. This was my first eBook reader and I'm surprised to be 100% satisfied. I've read more in the past month than I had in the previous year.I have no complaints about it at all. Small and durable. Light works great and is easily adjustable. I thought I would hate the advertisements but it's really just on the screen when the power is off, then it goes away when you start to read. I mostly use Overdrive for library books, and it's a bit of a pain (since you need a computer and the Kindle), but it's well worth it."
1,Awesome tablet. Good for reading and portable to bring all around.
1,It is very easy to set up and easy to use. I love the slick looks.
1,It works great as advertised. I bought a Micro SD card upgrade and that works too.
1,bought for mothers day.I got it because I saw it as one of the best books.She is so happy with the surprise
1,backlit screen is excellent for reading in bed. Paper white is excellent for reading in sun. Very compact. Super simple to use.
1,Gave to my wife as a gift and she loves it. She hasn't had any problems at all with it.
1,"The Amazon - Fire TV with (2015 Model) work great, easy setup"
1,Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !
1,"Great product, and works flawlessly with home automation. At first I was a huge skeptic about needing an always on device. However after buying an echo earlier this year from amazon, I have become an avid user. So much so that I bought a second one from best buy once they began carrying them! Also per-ordered their amazon dot, which is $49. Order one now, you will not be disappointed!"
1,Very happy with my purchase!! I bought this for my Mom and it was easy for her to navigate and she was able to easily download books and games.
1,Very good product not a lot of junk built in and that's good for the fact that you can use that storage for the apps you really want.
1,"I replaced my old Kindle with this one. The pull out light on the old one had been damaged by my grand son. This Kindle is so much smaller, lighter and the lighting makes it much easier to read. I got the cover that makes it look like a small notepad since I was traveling to Guatemala."
1,My kids love this tablet! All the fun without the steep price!
1,"Powerful tablet, perfect for the kids. Has everything they need all for under $50! Great buy"
1,Lots of useful skills to configure the Echo to your personal interests. It also is very good for playing music.
1,Works great.Terrific tablet for price.Would definitely recommend this tablet.
1,"I already have an Amazon Echo Show which I love by the way and purchased the Amazon Echo for my mother that was facinated with mine but was afraid of the camera on the Echo Show ""Black helicopters"". She lives alone and the Echo will help entertain her."
1,"The Echo is pretty awesome, especially if you have smart home things! My kids play games with it and can control our entire audio and video library! A little pricey, but worth it IMHO."
1,The Fire TV as opposed to the stick allows you to watch HD with no issues whatsoever. It has the capacity to download all your favorite apps including Crossy Road. Definitely would recommend to a friend.
1,"great price and a better gift,i was looking nice gift."
1,"I've had a Kindle for years, but with two granddaughters fighting for tablet usage, I purchased this Fire tablet for double duty-theirs and mine. I've always loved to read in bed but also love to highlight passages and mark pages--which is hard to do while lying in bed. This tablet lets me read numerous books at once, whichever one strikes my mood or connects to what's on my mind. I haven't really used it for books with the grandkids, they like to watch favorite videos or play kids games. Gotta remember to juice it up for when they show up unannounced!"
1,Enjoy the product. It works well. The whole family likes to use it.
1,Shopping and todo lists are very helpful with productivity. Fun interactions. Not always able to answer questions that she should be able to. Not connecting with Exchange calendar is a problem
1,I purchased this for my cousin as a Christmas gift and she just loved it. I couldn't believe that a $39 tablet could do so much.
1,Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.
1,"The smart home integration in this device is amazing! Great sounding speaker with a full, rich sound. Voice recognition is very good...could hear me from across the room with no problem."
1,Why pay additional monthly tv sevices from cable company where i can watch movies and tv channels from internet using fire tv.
1,"Easy setup and use. Compatible with echo dot, etc."
0,It is a pretty cool device. Not too friendly for the music I already had to get it to play them. My main use was to operate my ADT Pulse security system. It acts as a third party app and the question gets too lengthy and does not always find the device I wanted the first time. I took it back. Maybe the newer version coming out will work better.
1,"This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!"
1,easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty
1,It has been a great product for our son. Easy to use and excellent for learning and playing games. Video quality is very good as well.
1,"I like the reduced size, the touchscreen and the built-in light of Kindle peperwhite. But I used to have a Kindle 2nd edition device, which supported background music and audible content."
1,Great product!!! Great customer service!!! Can stream almost anything!!!
1,Item works great. Gets all of the channels and sites I am looking for and more.
1,Purchased this for a family member and they love it.
1,One of the best TV boxes on the market hands down.
1,Great little device for traveling. Perfect for reading books & playing games on the go. Was priced great during the holidays
1,"Great product, works as described. Has a lot of apps to choose from. One downside, I had a 2010 LG tv and the tv was too old to use the Amazon Fire tv. The Fire tv requires the tv to be hdcp 2.0 compliant. Many older tvs are not and won't work on them. Make sure it works before purchase."
1,Great for the child. Unfortunately it doesn't have a volume limit setting
1,"I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well."
1,This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.
1,"Perfect size tablet that can fit in a purse. Also, decent size screen for watching movies!"
1,"I wanted the Amazon Echo since last year, just waited for it to go on sale. I am still learning, but I love asking Alexa to turn on my music from Pandora...it is great. Ordered the dot for my bedroom, should be in soon..."
1,Bargain price for a fully functioning tablet. Not the fastest but certainly capable. Recommended!
1,You cant download too many apps so would recommend for the average reader
1,Amazing product! Works very well with Spotify and is very knowledgeable about everything. 5 stars
1,Love my (Alexa) amazon echo. Would highly recommend.
1,We use this for educational purposes for my kids - they love it!
1,Exactly as discribed. Love the product! I would recommend it!
1,Picked up my fire hd 10 from the store on Saturday. it took most of the day to update the software. You would think that he software would just update to the current software . even that was not a big deal. after that I had some issues with the battery so what I did was bring it back to a factory reset. what that did was keep the software build and battery life was better. I have not had any issues with the appstore and I also sideload apps that aren't available to the amzon appstore. all in all this tablet has been great for me. my other tablet was kindle hd 8.9 and it has service my good for the last 4 yrs
1,"Excellent product. Noticeably faster than the fire stick. I use it with my Tablo DVR, SlingTV, and Kodi. With this there is nothing else you will need."
0,the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. Perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later SW update but for now I have to say the performance is underwhelming. the Backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. The fire 7 HD which i also own has none of these issues. Get what you pay for rings true again.
1,Easy to use. No trouble downloading books from free sites.
1,I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
1,I love the Voyage. The display is clean and crisp and I have found the auto adjusting lighting to work perfectly for me. I love the side page turning buttons. I no longer have to use two hands to read a book anymore.
1,I checked out several other brands before I bought this one. In my opinion this is the best product for the price. It was easy to set up and easy to use. It opened a new door of entertainment possibilities.
0,Does not do as much as expected. Has a hard time finding information. Has to have extra things to work well I.e. Monthly fee
1,"Personalized to go with my amazon Prime account and inexpensive enough to get 1 for each member of the family. Easily read books, watch movies and powrful enough to go online for shopping and reviews."
1,This was a huge hit with my seven-year-old grandson. I came in to replace a broken tablet and they were no longer available. So I chose this one and it's better than ever!
1,Everyone should get this and eliminate cable!!!!!!
1,My daughter enjoys her kindle. Lovethis product!!
1,great improvement over the earlier versions. Like the option of a lighted background and speed of loading
1,It works great specially whit the new ligth frature
1,I love my kindle fire. It is a big upgrade from the kindle keyboard that i used to have.
1,"Sorry, nothing comes to mind at this time. I like the product..."
1,Great for kids of people who don't need lots of memory
1,"great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price"
1,I purchased this because have become a cord cutter and this was highly recommended by a good friend as a worthy streaming box. I was pleasantly how fast and responsive it is and future proof with the added 4K functionality. Only downside is that it has a tremendous amount of amazon bloatware which I understand but it is constantly present.
0,It locked up on installing kodi and it wouldn't recover. The device buffers during first setup of any movie. Voice remote is not the best.
0,I actually ended up returning this item because I got frustrated with the adds. If it wasn't for that I probably would have given it 5 stars.
1,Very good for the price. Connection good and easy to setup
1,Problem is battery life. Seems short compared to earlier models.
1,"I am very pleased with Amazon Fire TV, I see my films, my children play games and watch channels"
1,I was looking for a small tablet for the front room to run my Sonos speakers. This works great. Just keep it right next to my chair and don't have to remember my phone or ipad
1,Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!
0,"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead."
1,"It's great, does everything that the Amazon fire $149 one does minus a few inches and the size is so much better! Easier to carry and store and the quality is the same"
1,Decent speed and a nice screen make this a great device for the money. I find myself using it more and more.
1,Need one for your kindle...
1,Easy to use for all ages. Easy to learn and use all the amazon apps. Amazon stands behind their product pretty well.
1,"Kindle is good. I got one for my husband and sister. They are really enjoying them. It is easy to use for someone who never used one. My reason for not giving 5 stars was completely due to my best buy experience. I live in a small town and drove thirty miles to get to best buy only to find they were completely out. Asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me.I wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any.I was willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them. They would not do that. I had to drive another 50 miles to pick one up. Just thought best buy should have tried to be more accommodating, but it was Christmas shopping season."
1,This case works great. It was exactly what I was looking for.
1,Easy to set up and easy to use! And the speaker sounds amazing.
1,It's a good cheap tablet. The ads on the lock screen are a major downfall.
1,AWESOME LIL TABLET I BOUT THIS FOR A CO WORKER AND THEY LOVE IT
1,Great streaming device comes with alexa which is top of the line only regret is not getting the one with game controller alot of games require game controller or need it to make the game fun now im forced to buy it separately
1,"For adults or children, the Amazon ""fire"" tablet is impeccable. It has pertness control for parents with young children. If you have a Amazon account, it syncs right to it. Overall, flawless."
1,"I purchased this for our kids for a road trip, we loaded some movies prior to the trip and I must say it was very quiet for once. At night I was able to use it to catch up on some reading. Nice tablet for the price."
1,"ALEXA IS GOOD FOR REMINDERS, USE AS AN ALARM CLOCK, PLAY MUSIC NICE SPEAKER SYSTEM ALSO WORKS WITH WEMO AND OTHER SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL YOUR ELECTRONICS IN THE HOUSE INCLUDING HEATING AND COOLING."
1,My kids are on their tablets for hours on end. I was able to download several preschool apps for them. They actually are learning very well. The tablet us simple to use and they can navigate themselves on the tablet very easily.
1,Very nice works just like I thought it would.works great.
1,"The Fire is best used as a book reader, but having the ability to check mail, surf a bit, etc., is very nice. For the price, it can't be beat."
1,"My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it."
1,I purchased this tablet on a whim and it was the best decision I ever made. It is easy to use and so much fun!!
1,This tablet is just the right size for travel and the kids.It has the Amazon app store and user interface and lots ofgreat features. Auto uploads pictures and videos to your Amazon cloud.If you have Prime you can watch Amazon prime Video too
1,Great battery life and having the back lit screen allows you to read in dim or no light.
1,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book."
1,"Best Kindle yet, better resolution faster processor, very flexible use"
1,purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
1,"All members of the family can use it, children and also seniors"
1,"I managed to make 4 kids very happy this Christmas with each getting their very own tablet! Great for gaming, emailing, streaming music & videos!"
1,"a great tablet for the price, i love now that the amazon fire tablet has a micro sd slot. lightweight, connect to net easy,"
0,"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
1,"I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this."
1,Dual cameras work great. Perfect compact size not too big or small. The best thing about the tablet is that you can add a sd card up to 128gb.
1,5 star in everything..Close your eyes and just buy it
1,"I love my kindle, the paperwhite is great for reading outside because you don't get a reflection back like you do with other types of kindles. The white color is a nice change."
1,Bought this device to stream movies and shows online!
1,"What a great value! I thought at first that it was so underpowered that it would be useless, but not so. I have bought 6 of them so far, and am lovin it!"
1,"Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games"
1,Great product from Amazon that does not fail. Package well!
1,This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
1,"This is FANTASTIC! Alexa can hear ME clearly, even in a busy, NOISE filled room. With the TV blaring in the background , while watching a cricket match from across the room, I asked the question, she played the music I asked for. I love it. You just have to say Alexa first, then ASK away!"
1,"pretty good, works great and is very easy to install,"
1,I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.
1,My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable.
1,Just the right size for reading. Backlight great for low light reading or no light. Quick book downloads. Kindle lending library is also cool If you're a prime member. You can also e-mail yourself a PDF to the device which is sent to an email assigned to the same.
1,"For $33 during black Fri and even the regular $50 this is a steal. Performance, battery life and ease of use are great. Several profiles in same tablet an added bonus!"
1,I wish echo could play music (at the same time with the same song)to other dots in the house
1,Works as expected.
1,It was time to upgrade and I'm happy with my choice.
1,My 3 yr old loves her new tablet and my wife and I are glad to get ours back. Very simple usage. Has all of her favorite apps on it.
1,Having a great time with Alexia. I gave two of these away as Christmas gifts and got the best gift award from my children.
1,"The Amazon Fire TV is great. I enjoy watching the news, movies and sports with it"
0,"Sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music, but I still prefer Sonos for this purpose. Alexa is useful for controlling the widest range of smart home products, but it's not backed by Google Home's superior search intelligence, so it isn't that great for asking in-depth questions of it. There are comparisons of these products out there, so take a look before making a decision. Since I mostly wanted it for home control, it suits my need."
1,"Was tired of using my iPad as my sole reader. Decided to go back to Kindle. This is by far the best Amazon has done in the Kindle arena yet. Simplistic, sleek & no more eye strain."
0,"It's a basic tablet, nothing fancy but great for its price."
1,Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
1,"It turned out to be a good product. Glad I bought it, came in handy for school."
1,FireTv is great. Easily installed and user friendly.
0,I hope to have it set up for my disabled daughter sooon
1,I bought this for our family Christmas gift and we are having fun asking Alexa questions..I think we are ready for a couple of dots.
1,This is my son's and he loves it. It has nice picture good speed and he uses it all the time. My only regret is it didn't get 1 for myself.
1,The fire kid edition 7 is good but not great. Volume is pretty low. But my son throws it around and it doesn't break. Case is stone hard. I also the the brightness on the screen can be a bit low.
1,"My son's already each had one. Got one for my husband. Great value, and all are reading more than they ever did."
0,Unfortunately I've been using a far superior tablet when I decided to purchase the Amazon Fire tablet. Comparisons are unavoidable. The Amazon Fire works. Amazon only apps are not as numerous as Google. The tablet is not as streamlined as my other tablet.
1,"Bought for my wife for mothers day, as she wanted something to read in the sunshine this summer, and it performs amazingly in that respect. We have iPads and regular Kindle Fire units (the kids), but only this one can be read in any light, any time of day. Only 4 stars as I'm not sure why terribly more expensive than the Fire units, but it solves for those who like to read under sunlight at the beach or by the pool, couldn't be clearer."
1,"With so many program choices available with Amazon Fire Stick, why would you want cable? Cable is just too expensive. This is a much cheaper alternative to cable."
1,"Christmas present for a 4 year old. Showed her once how to turn it on, how to charge and how to get to the various apps. She is totally capable of operating the device on her own. So easy breezy a 4 year old can use it independently."
1,"Got it as a gift for a family member, and it works pretty good for the price you pay. Not a lot of tablets for $50 range. And it's pretty decent. Recommend to a friend who ended up buying for himself."
1,This is one neat little tablet. Can be used to surf net or read. I use it for both. Light and comfortable to use.
1,Use it mainly when I'm not on my Apple TV . The Amazon fire tv is much better than the fire stick because it doesn't heat up .
1,Works just as advertised. 4K streaming looks really good.
1,Great tablet for kids to learn puzzles and letters. Has tons of activities for children and a full tablet for adults perfect if you have pime!
1,I liked the tablet I bought its amazing works just fine thank u best buy
0,"I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on."
1,"I own 2 Echos and 3 Echo Dots. I gave my black Echo to my mother in law who is in a retirement place. She cannot see well so she uses ""Alexa"" to listen to music and read books from my Amazon Prime account. I replaced my beautiful, tall, black Echo with an Echo Dot on my desk and use a Bluetooth speaker to get great sound. The White Echo is downstairs in my wife's office. We have one Dot in the bedroom one in the family room. Alexa hears commands from the closest Echo and performs almost flawlessly. The tall Echos have wonderful speakers with tremendous bass. You can even tell the tall echos to set volume from 1 to 10 (max). Great product.Echo accesses my Pandora account as well as some smart devices around the house."
1,Great features and easy to use. A must buy for Prime members.
1,I could not be happier with this purchase. Lots of entertainment in one small package!
1,"For a basic tablet, this is perfect. Good price. Does all I need it to!"
1,The price was right and just what my husband needed. Easy to use and setup.
1,I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
1,"Fits its purpose as a book reader, but the touch screen could be smoother though."
1,"There are a few options in this area. Amazon has more time and experience in the field, and in some ways it shows. It doesn't do everything yet, but is growing all the time. Surprisingly good speaker, and Alexa is quite good with voice recognition."
1,My son is 18 months and this kids him nice and quiet
1,This speaker is a must have! The Amazon Echo has Wonderful sound and can control a lot of electronics! It can tell you jokes and even start your car
1,Will be getting rid of cable as as soon as possible!!!
1,for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
1,Perfect little tablet for my son for Christmas. The price makes it a steal for a tablet these days. In addition it meets the requirements a 7 year old has for media needs. He's able to read his homework on it nightly plus take pictures of which he's addicted to lately!
1,"can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup."
1,Love this box so much. No longer need cable. Love being able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows
1,This is a easy functioning product. Good for reading.
1,Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much
1,Bought for my children. Holds plenty of apps. Safe to use with parental controls. Pretty durable but definitely recommend buying a screensaver and case for it.
1,"Love my Echo, it was easy to set up, and easy to use."
1,Very nice tablet. It does everything I need it to do
0,I use this mini tablet at the gym to watch streaming tv and movie shows.- easy to setup- take a bit of time to get used to various screens- touch screen is a little slow to respond- bluetooth connectivity is not automatic. I have to try and connect the same device every time I use the tablet- overall very good for the price
1,My laptop broke so I needed something so for the price I couldn't go wrong.
1,Just what I expected!
1,"Simple to use, a must own if you have Amazon Prime"
1,i love diz one cheap&best price last year purchase this product
1,Alexa volume is amazing but she does have a hard time hearing your commands when playing loud music
1,This Kindle Fire provides the portability that I was looking for.
1,"If you have an Amazon Prime account, you should have a fire tablet. It is so easy to have Kindle books, Amazon music and videos at your finger tips. This is $34 or however much I paid well spent. Now, what I don't like about the tablet is the operating system; it is limiting. Bottomline is if you need to do something other than use the Amazon suite of features you will need another tablet. However, I have no problem with using this specifically for the Amazon stuff and for managing my echo dot."
1,started with the early Kindle years ago and upgraded to the Paperwhite. My wife and I each have one and they go everywhere with us.
1,It has everything we need so cable is not needed in this house!
1,"Reading paper books makes me sleepy, after only 8 pages!Reading on the Kindle Paperwhite is fantastic... read 65 pages non stop!Love it."
1,"It's great. I am an apple and amazon user, and it works for many devices that are not (yet) compatible with apple products."
1,Setup was easy and you can manage stuff with the Alexa app on the phone (of course you need an Amazon account). So far only used it for music and setting timers but works pretty good. Tons of skills/apps available so we'll try more soon!
1,The FireTV unit was very easy to set up. Just had to connect the HDMI cable to the box and the TV and we were in business. The remote control worked great - although inside of HULU it took a little time to figure out how to get back to the HULU home page (just keep hitting the return button) -- but that's a HULU issue. The FireTV connected quickly to the home WIFI.
1,Set up directions could have been more detailed. Works fine with Sirius XM.
1,"Got for my wife's xmas. She loves it and uses it more than she thought she would. Small screen but good for kindle reading. Maybe worth the $15 for no ads, annoying"
1,Easy setup and fast for the money. No problem with it.
1,Great way of upgrading to a Smart TV less the price tag.
0,"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
1,"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle."
1,Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
1,Excellent product. Works flawlessly and very handy.
1,nice upgrade for the family! We are more of a techie family. Ours is attached to a pc.
1,My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.
1,"Great for streaming. 4K capable , not as good as the nvidia shield but also less then half the price . Overall and excellent buy for the price."
1,Great product! Love BB Great product! Love BB Great product! Love BB
1,Kids load them with moves and used them for long car rides
1,"Perfect for watching Netflix, surfing web, checking email, and reading kindle books."
1,Item worked fine
1,Can't find a better tablet for the price! Not HD but good enough. Expandable memory is very nice!
1,I now have two of these boxes. They are better than Apple roku and other boxes for Internet tv.
0,"The number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that Amazon will stand behind it - for a short while. I am on my 3rd, all of which have been plagued with screen issues. Dead pixels. Everywhere. If you don't have them straight out of the box, great..but, they can develop - and in the great majority of these, they will develop. It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you). It is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an e-reader (however, the screen isn't as bright as other e-readers), or mp3 player. As they say, you get what you pay for. This is a decent basic option."
1,"This is my second tablet, but first based on android. This is their entry level tablet but still very responsive and snappy. The memory is upgradeable via memory card."
1,"This is my second Amazon echo, I now have one in the bedroom and living area. I work from home so this as become my personal assistant. It's amazing what you can do out of the box but if you like to tinker you can write your own skills and extend the feature set. One of those devices that you wonder how you lived with out it."
1,"Ask her about the weather, the news, have her play a song simply by giving her a lyric, read audiobooks, etc... the only thing she doesn't do is make phone calls if the other person doesn't have an Echo"
1,my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better
1,This is the best for reading and not getting out of concentration with other apps. The battery lasts a lifetime. The best for traveling.
1,Great little tablet....does everything I wanted it to do. It's a breeze to get online and check email.
1,This is the second fire tablet I have purchased. I purchased one a year ago for myself and bought the second for my wife. She loves it.
1,I've installed and its working perfect Im very impress with the product next time I need any software I will always looking for Best Buy stores
1,"Bought two tablets for the kiddos. Overall, price was great and works well. Only issue is download speed. Tends to take a while to download apps and other stuff."
0,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
1,Christmas presents for our girls. They work really well.
1,I got this as a b-day gift for my mom who has severe macular degeneration. She loves being able to ask Alexa questions and get immediate answers!
1,I love it! Much better quality than previous version! No lagging at all!!!!
1,"We purchased the Amazon Echo on a whim, but really enjoy using it. Easy to get information with just a question, listen to music, get local weather information. Even my 4 year old granddaughter knows how to ask Alexa questions. Great addition to our household."
1,"Perfect, simple device for reading ebooks. Does exactly what you'd expect it to do. Holds a charge for a really long time. Easy to use and set up. Light and convenient for reading on the go."
1,Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
1,Very inexpensive and well made little tablet. Picked up two for the kids and they love them.
1,The box works great it was a great buy. I'm able to watch some great movies
1,This tab is awesome. Easy to handle and carry anywhere because of its size. The price also very reasonable.
1,This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
1,"Echo works really well, but I only use it for music and news, can't really say a lot about the other functions. Drawback is that it can't answer a lot of questions and unlike the Google Home, it won't remember what I asked prior."
1,Not many things she doesn't know. Got echo as gift for Christmas.
1,Works well while in the kitchen are covered in food.
1,Amazon Echo helped me to make my home smart.Apart from turning on and off the lights. one can enjoy alexa company!!
0,I bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one. Not much storage and the cord strips easily.
1,"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
1,Mom has a Kindle she loves. She was using an old Samsung Tab2 of mine that finally died. I got the Fire tablet so she could have the best of both worlds. She LOVES it!
1,My kids loves this tablet. They watch YouTube and play games on it all day.
0,"Not sure of quality. His first Kindle Fire would no longer charge properly. It was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed. He has already had a problem with this one charging properly; however, I believe the problem might have been with the charging cord and not the tablet itself."
1,I love this tablet. It is the right size and I love playing movies on it.
1,Keeps my kids busy for hours the apps are excellent
1,The amazon 4K is amazing. Way better than the stick. The box runs smoother than the stick and wor
1,"Love it. Play any music, get weather, news, sports info and so much more. Create shopping lists and reminders. It's also an alarm clock and can make your home a smart home with some accessories."
1,"We have tried TiVo, Roku and Fire...... Fire is the best by far. I like the menu and available apps!"
1,Amazon continues to excel and lead in this technology
1,"This is my fourth Kindle and my second Paper white. Not much to say as it meets my expectations. I can read it in any lighting conditions, sunlight to dim indoor lighting. Battery life is great as in the past. If you had a Kindle in the past or present you know what I am talking about. Those that have not had one and are thinking about buying one just do it, you will not be disappointed. I suggest that you buy the cover for your Kindle. Best thing about the Kindle is that if you fall asleep while reading it you will go back to the last page you read before falling asleep."
1,"This was a gift for my wife and she loves it, so needless to say so do I."
1,"The echo has a small problem in that it is a blue tooth receiver only. You can blue tooth your devises to it, tablet , phone ,or other devices. It would be better if you could connect it to a good quality stereo receiver that enable blue tooth. The dot can be connect to blue tooth speakers or blue tooth capable audio receivers. The Dot does have a small speaker in it so if it is not connected you can still use it. The problem with the dot is if you use the included 3.5 mm audio jack it disable the internal speaker. This means you have to have the audio component on to hear the Dot. However the blue tooth connection on the Dot works great. I own a Marantz AV receiver with blue tooth. I tell Alexa to connect and it automatically turns on the receiver, set it to the correct input and is ready to play music or any other audio I want to listen to through the Dot. When I tell Alexa to disconnect it turns of the receiver and switches back to the internal speaker. If you are buying an echo device for a high quality music server using Amazon music then you want an echo Dot.If you want to listen to average sounding speaker that you can place just about any where in your house the Echo is a great product."
1,"Its not exactly pink, but magenta is close enough. Girls like random anyways."
1,"I have purchased several fire sticks through out my house, this one thus far as been the best. Loving the voice search it's like having siri on your tv."
0,Whats the point of this without the cable to charge!
1,"my family and i really love alexa, she works great and doubles as an assistant and a wireless speaker, I cant wait till she learns more commands"
1,I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES GADGETS.
1,The ECHO is the best music player in the House hands down
1,Great Christmas gift for my son. Best tablet ever.
1,"The Fire Stick is inexpensive, easy to set up and really responsive. Ended up buying a few of these for the entire family."
1,My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future.
1,Nice work good look al my movies work great on my tv
0,Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that
1,"An Apple TV was out of the question - lacked access to Prime videos and forced me to rent from iTunes (rarely offers discounted rentals). Leaving me with Roku or the Fire TV. Went with the Fire TV to try something different (owned Rokus before), and have been very pleased. The UI looks great, the voice search is reliable and ability to access so many apps easily makes it easy for others to use."
1,"I lost my Kindle reader and bought this to replace it. With quad core processor, it's very fast, faster than my Samsung Tab 2. I use it as a reader and, when traveling, use it to watch stuff on Amazon Prine, HULU or Netflix. And it's only 49.99. 8 GB memory, but I don't use it for photos, so that doesn't matter."
1,It's a great product. I recommended to everyone. :-)
1,"Sure helps in the "" cord cutting"" with the cable company!!"
1,"Yes, you get ads on the lockscreen but the Fire OS has improved do much that it makes up for any shortcoming. It's a great tablet for the price"
1,I purchased this to watch movies and such on a led tv that doesn't have smart features built in and because of the ability to side load apps. Just an added bonus you can pair bluetooth headphones to the fire tv but not the stick
1,It's good for toddlers. Would recommend to another parent.
1,Had a gen 1 Kindle and so glad I moved up to this. Great for outdoor sunny reading. A must have !
1,The Echo is plenty loud for our needs and performs as expected.
1,I got two of these for my young kids. It does everything I could ask for and I can limit how much they use it. Great product for a great price
1,"I've read three books in less than a month! Before, I had a problem with getting tired while reading and my eyes hurt from the book light I had to use; but with the back light on the paper white I can adjust it perfectly to my liking! I love it!"
1,"Excellent device. Screen is impressive. Happy with this purchase, and looking forward to reading many books on it!"
1,This is great for kids. Plays movies and games and is relatively inexpensive. The processor is not nearly as fast an iPad or iPhone but cost a fraction of the price and works great for kids.
0,"This thing has major connectivity issues, save your money and wait for a later version."
1,This kindle was a prize for a raffle for a union meeting. Excellent for beginners just starting off. Great price
1,I bought this for my 11 year old nephew and he uses it a lot.
1,"Love the sound quality, perfect for what l needed it for."
1,"The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper."
1,Not long enough for battery life.Confusion for Amazon app user.To be careful if I plan to use in the future.
1,"Still needs work as it does not always understand questions and needs more info installed so as to be more user friendly. I got it on sale so decided to try it. Works very well with my wemo light switches and like telling it to play my music and set alarms. For the price I got it for it will pass until they update it some more, It's a work in progress!"
1,"I love that the directions are loaded on the Kindle, easy to bookmark information and are clear."
1,Loved the box does exactly what is supposed to do stream movies all day long
1,"I've had the old 6"" HD Amazon tablet which I use with the students at the school where I teach. Got this 7"" tablet on my first day at this job to keep at home and use. The larger real estate of this tablet is fantastic...along with the new version of the OS."
1,"Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book."
1,Nice tablet and at a outstanding price. Still going strong..
1,we have enjoyed the unit and have used it a lot since we purchased it.
1,"I've had one of these before, but I lost it in the divorce. I happily bought another one. They're so easy to carry around, and setup is trivial."
1,"I'm not very electronic savvy but with a little help Alexa is helpful, funny, fun and smart!"
1,"Excellent gadget, a little tricky in the beginning to setup the commands, but once you got it, everything goes well"
0,I bought the Amazon Fire thinking it was all that and it is as long as I am home with a strong wifi. It does not pick up wifi good the connection is very weak when I try to connect elsewhere like I have to be right near the box or it doesn't pick up. But I find that with my camera also an Amazon product. Ok so that may be the problem.
1,"Purchased this to replace my ATV to allow use of Playstation Vue. As a huge Apple user, I expected it to be a sacrifice but I love this even more than my ATV."
1,The Echo is Portable with the Purchase of the Optional Echo Battery Base It is High quality Sound and Has to many options to list needs Hue Hub adapter to use Hue Light Bulbs but can control unto 50 at a time . Has good answers for everything Highly Recommended But best if you have an Amazon Account you can listen to Audio Books etc you have purchased . So much fun .
1,EVERY ONE SHOULD OWN THIS PRODUCT. EVERY THING THAT THE AD SAYS IT DOES IT DOES. I BOUGHT THIS FOR THE MUSIC THERE IS NOTHING BETTER
1,Easy to use and clarity is wonderful! This was a present for my daughter and she loves it.
1,I would recommend the Kindle Paper White to anyone.
1,"I bought this for my 7 year old, it has endured all that a 7 year old would and could give it."
1,"I love my kindle, it's easy to navigate through the pages and apps. More people friendly than I imagined."
1,"Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger."
1,"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
1,"I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!"
1,Bought this for our 6 year old to use instead of spending the big bucks on an Ipad. It has pretty much all the same apps and it is easy for him to navigate around. Parental controls prevent him from downloading anything above his age level.
1,works smoothly when typing search info to google things. constructed well. The casing is solid and well made. Operation of this tablet is great.
1,"This product is simply amazing , I won't say its e,actly like Apple because it isn't and I previously owned 1 while recording , never been a big fan of apple anyways. This product is ridcously good for the price its being seller for ,similar format to an Ifap but not the same and can use wireless internet! 1024 graphs cs count me in , can be used as a car steel as well with an aux cable! I use amazon all the time and extremely am pleased with this product.bought itmstore along with saw series , where'd all the CDs go!"
1,"Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can't comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me."
1,The whole family enjoys using Alexa. My son even ask Alexa for his assignments lol
1,I got this as a present for my wife. She really likes it. She uses it to check out the weather before going out. It is able to tell her what her fit-bit count is without her having to open her laptop or her phone app. We can have it play Pandora or i-heart radio. And it keeps track of our shopping list.
1,Hoping to replace cable TV in the near future. Works great.
1,"My wife was getting frustrated that she couldn't see the screen on her Nook Samsung Tab 4 when she would be on the beach or out in the sun, both places she wants to read. After comparing reviews of the Kindle and the Nook Glowlight Plus, she chose the Kindle and has been quite happy with the decision. She gets most of her books from our library with Overdrive and has had no problem with downloading them from Amazon. The Kindle is light and holds and feels like a book. She added a cover off Amazon so it turns on and off when it is opened/closed. She likes being able to read out on our deck or in the sunroom just as easily as she does inside."
1,I bought this rather than a Kindle Fire as I was just looking to read and not use any apps.
1,unit is very reliable. better option than the fire stick as you can hard wire with the fire tv box
1,Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
1,A gift for my elderly mother who complained about not being able to listen to music whenever she wanted. Now she can ask Alexa for just about anything and get an answer.
1,Amazon Fire TV is the best ever I have it' is good
1,"Size is perfect for little hands, Great features and excellent reviews. Great amount of space needed for use."
1,"This is a great deal, especially when on sale for $40. Great for letting my kids watch Netflix on with wifi..."
1,"This is actually worth the money to purchase if you're wanting to watch Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Everything that you can download on your android devices will be on here and you can even download games to play for kids and adults alike. Easy to set up and use. Just need to set up your Amazon account, and if you don't have one you can make one to use it. Bought one for my mother in law. Best $100 spent. I do not regret this purchase at all."
1,"I was amazed how little it cost to get a Kindle Fire these days. I passed down my iPad mini to my son because he uses it a lot and I just wanted something to watch Netflix and read books. The big plus is the book lending library with our prime membership. It's noticibly slower than my old iPad, but for $50 I'm very happy with it."
1,I got it for my daughter for Christmas. I really liked the kids setting where she only had access to kid friendly apps and websites.
1,"I purchased another Amazon Fire this year for my other grandson for Christmas. It is a very good buy for a child's first tablet. It does not have a lot of memory but can be expanded. The Amazon Fire allows for games, movies, and digital books to be used. The price is awesome for the value."
1,Plays music fantastically and has answered all my questions
1,We love our Amazon Alexa!! We ask her the weather and play music everyday.
1,Much better than the fire stick has a lot of memory and processor so it's very fast between menus. most likely will buy another one for another TV
1,Was given as a gift and Husband extremely pleased with the purchase.
1,"There is no better E-reader available today. It costs a bit more, but the build quality is the best."
1,I would definitely recommend this product for the price.
1,Its exactly what I am wanted and the price was fair
1,This basic Amazon Kindle is a great value considering its power and retail price.
1,"I bought a few of these as Christmas presents for my family, and they have been a big hit. Alexa is able to recognize voices from across the room, even while cooking, talking, or playing music in the background. it's a lot of fun to ask her questions and see her responses, and as she continues to grow/learn, there will be more useful options to take advantage of."
1,Images quality better than l had imagine. Good for games and easy to download games on Amazon . My son love it.
1,Bought these while they were on sale for the kids. They loved it.
1,I got this item for a great price..I order it in the Best Buy web site and was ready to pick up in 45 min. Great customer service
1,I had researched the product thoroughly and it performed as expected.
1,Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
1,"Got the Echo home and immediately set it up and started to use it. Linked my smart devices and spent a few minutes testing the lights, thermostat, etc. All worked extremely smooth and the sensitivity of the microphone was great. My kids spent the afternoon taking turns asking Alexa to play ""Who Let the Dogs Out."" Fun times."
1,I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.
1,My husband loves this. They battery life is aweseome. Nice to take when traveling!
1,Still a great device even though it's a little older than the Voyage and Oasis. Perfect for reading at night and has great resolution. Love it!
1,"Didn't realize having Amazon prime still wouldn't play all songs, actually doesn't play a lot of the ones I requested."
1,"I primarily use this as a media tablet and it does it pretty well. The expandable storage is nice and it has around 6-7 hours of continuous local video play. Downsides to this product are the bad external speaker and limited apps available, but hey it's $50."
1,"I had a first gen paperwhite and wasn't sure if the upgrade would be worth it but it really is a nice step up. Software is pretty much the same obviously, but the screen is a real step up and isn't that why you get a kindle over a tablet."
1,Great unit my neice can use when traveling to watch videos and take photos.
1,The echo is still in the beginning stages of AI but is still great to have in your home. I loved how I could speak in another room in a normal voice and echo will work on command.
1,My grandson loved it He plays it everyday Papa I love it
0,it does a lot LESS than you would expect. the advertisements is about all it does. no need to spend this large amount of money to listen to music you have on your phone. any info you get on the echo you get on your phone.
1,"Worth every penny, amazing functions. Alexa is loud and crisp"
1,This could be a 5 star as well- just a jump in price for a bit better sound as the Dot. Functions are the same but it's sound is def better-
1,"This is my first e-reader. It makes reading fun again. With Prime reading and my local library, I have many free reading options available to me. Easy to read in both bright sunshine and in the dark. Get one!"
1,I got this to control my Hue lightbulbs and it works great. Surprised at how fast it is!
1,I purchased this tablet for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It has parental controls also (which she doesn't love)!
1,Quick and light good for car rides plenty of apps and easy for my 2year old to use
1,Works very well with Hue lights and as a music source.
1,I was looking for a reader that I could use outdoors and found this device to be excellent outdoors. The battery life thus far has been excellent. It took some adjustment going from my Kindle fire to the Kindle paperwhite. Overall I am very happy with this new device.
1,May grandson loves this. Went on a long car trip and he was able to watch movies and keep entertained.
1,I bought more than 4 of these for our kids and they were worth it!
1,"Love the Blue color!!! Great Tablet to travel with. I also got the orange and purple color one, love the colors :)"
1,Bought this just to have as a device to read my comixology account. Works perfectly for my needs!!
1,"Didn't think I would get much out of this but I already had hue lights, harmony remote and august smart lock. Alexa controls all of them! She is also a cool companion giving my news and sports update in the morning while I make my coffee. Mindfulness minutes are great when paired with Apple Watch app of the same name."
1,The up grades where a very nice choice and better.
1,This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
1,"Exciting technology that blows your mind. Very easy to set up , you won't be disappointed with this product."
1,My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great
1,"Bought this as my nephews first tablet. He loves it, and it's still in one piece! Worth my $!"
1,This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!
1,Overall couldn't be more happier with the tablet works great for the price of it I would def recommend to my friends
1,Tablet does everything I need it to. Only thing I don't like is how short the cord is.
1,This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
1,"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
1,What can I say I'm very happy with this fire tv go it mainly so I can use my Sony vue. It's very nice. This is my 3 one this year
1,"It's a tablet, there's not much more to it than that. Simple interface, and easy to use."
1,This tablet was bought for my 3 year old. He loves it and it's great. There is one caveat though. It is loaded with ads. Everytime the tablet is turned on or screen locked there are amazon ads. Because of this I now have a new 250.00 vacuum that was accidentally ordered. So make sure 1 click buying is disab k ed
1,My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
1,"This basic tablet was just what I wanted for our Gift tree."" It was a good buy for the quality and price. The tablet has a good reputation for reliability."
1,"I have not figured out the full potential of this device. The sound quality is surprisingly nice for the size of the machine. If you order home products from Amazon on a regular basis, then this is the toy for you. All you have to do is say Alexa order laundry detergent. Boom, it is done and on its way to your house. So becareful when you are telling Alexa to order stuff."
1,"This product meets all of my requirements and is very fast and easy to use. Locating and logging into other ""public"" WiFi systems was and is fast and easy."
1,For the price it is great and it is quick to search
1,Makes for a great alarm and reminder device. I own 2 dots and the tap. Use them all.
1,I'm not a techno savvy person but found this extremely easy to set up. I have managed to connect my nest thermostat and wemo plug to it. I can't seem to get the Samsung tv to work with it. Oh well. I primarily use it to listen to music and find the sound to be great. One of the best purchases I've made in a long time.
1,"Purchased for my son. He really likes it. It does everything I want it to do without offering too much access. The option to lock it down for a certain amount of time each day is something my wife and I love, so he doesn't overuse technology in lieu of other activities."
0,"It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running. Everytime my kids play a game, the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory. I would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an e-book reader."
1,Enjoy that it has the light so I can read at any time and in any light. Only gave 4 stars because there is always room for improvement.
1,"Good tablet for simple use like reading books, music and simple tasks."
1,"Great price point for tablet, has front & back camera"
1,"Delivered a crisp display but had trouble with the keyboard size, using a stylus helped!"
1,Bought for son for Christmas very easy to use and durable
1,I love everything about this tablet except for the camera it's only a 2 MP.
1,"Kids love it, no real issues. Solid tablet for the value."
1,"This is a lot of fun to work with, also I'm still learning different things she can do.Love being able to turn lights on with my voice.Just amazing"
1,The battery life is pretty good and the best feature in my opinion is the expandable memory slot. It allows me to store all of music so I don't have to use my phone and get a call in the middle of a party
1,"Good for music, but thought it would do a lot more."
1,I have an Amazon Echo and an Amazon Dot. Love the functionality. Decent sound for what they are. I just wanted something portable for outside.
1,"After having worn out one Kindle and discovered Kindle Fire can't be read in sunlight, I decided on the Kindle paperwhite. Infinitely readable and the light adjusts. I love the new Bookerly font"
1,I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !
0,It does what it is supposed to do.
1,"Perfect size reader, no fuss, websurfing, videos, netflix, hulu, no problem"
0,Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.
1,"Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too."
1,"The Echo is not cheap but provides entertainment far beyond its original cost. The longer I have it, the more uses I find. ....and it looks good."
0,We got this for our son. He is always wanting to play on Mom's tablet so we thought this would be a good choice. His aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one. Within a month the charging cord on both units quit working and shortly after that the ports became squirly so you have to hold them just right or they don't charge. Save your money and get a more expensive but better quality product.
1,"Great addition! Customizable news briefings, controls my wemo lights and has games for the kids and so much more. Love using Amazon Prime Music the most!"
1,Amazing fun getting into the technology age. Connected Echo w Philips Hue lights and Bluetooth speakers. All works great. Wifi consistency a must. Takes getting used to asking a non-human questions!
1,The fire tv is one of the best android boxes out there great for any streaming media you can imagine
1,Best Black Friday deal. They were available and I got two!
1,For the functionality and price it can't be beat. Why pay more for a sub par off band tablet when you can get a trusted brand. Makes a great gift especially for little ones and you don't break the bank.
1,kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
1,Absolutely love it friends and family all purchase on
1,Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price!
1,For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.
1,Bought two of these for the kids so they would not fight and could each have their own. They love them so far. I like that I can add an SD card for extra storage.
1,"This things is amazing. I had a Roku and a Matricom G box before it. It's fast, has expandable storage, usable USB ports, and you can easily side load Kodi. The only gripe I have is that there is no IR control, so you can't program it to a smart remote. I do like the fact they make an app for iOS and Android so that make it a bit better, but it would be nice to have one remote control I can use to control everything."
1,"I didn't want to mess with or pay for an additional satellite box, so this was a great way to be able to watch things in a bedroom we converted into a tv room."
1,Alexa is super helpful to have around for reminders alarms and info. good sound to the speakers as well and can have in any room with an outlet.
1,"Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!"
1,It should be in every home. Very easy to use and the speakers are excellent
1,Great product. This is my 2nd Kindle paperwhite. Compared prices and this was the best one I found.
1,There are not enough functions on this tablet. But it has great battery life
1,Device is very simple but well worth the money. Making it a great value.
1,We use it for songs alarm and ask anything. It constantly updates from cloud and so every week it's learning something new
1,This tablet is great for a beginner. It is really inexpensive and does a great job for a young kid. I purchased this for my nephew. He loves it.
1,I suggest this to anyone looking to watch Netflix and Hulu simple.
1,"I bought this because the PlayStation Vue interface is the same as what you see on Sony PlayStation. But while I was having al sorts of problem with PlayStation running PlayStation Vue, I didn't encounter any of the sameProblems when using FireTV. It's like when Oracle GoldenGate was working better with Sybase database than with Oracle. :-)I will wait for newer version of FireTV for my other TVs.FireTV is the best streaming device for PlayStation Vue."
0,"Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good."
1,"Echo can do many things. It can play your songs, answer questions, serve as an alarm clock, etc. It listens constantly and responds immediately. When I forget a spelling, Echo can tell you how."
1,This is my third Kindle. At the $49. price this is an incredible tablet. I highly recommend this product.
1,"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
1,"My husband has a kindle fire and 3 of my kids do also. My husband loves his. My kids tablets are great with a variety of apps. Maine draw back, tablets vs kitchen floor and the floor won. Tablet 1 screen cracked."
1,I got this for my 8 year old because he loves to read and i wanted something that he couldnt browse the internet on. He loves it so far.
1,"Great for a good quality Android TV box. QUADCORE, Bluetooth remote and will accept a Bluetooth keyboard."
1,"Lightweight, fits perfectly in my hands, good screen quality. Makes reading even more enjoyable."
1,I got this because it is almost impossible to break
1,Great learning tool for the grand kids. Helps with there homework.
1,My daughter wanted this product for herself. I got this unit based on the price and size.
0,I bought 2 of these on Black Friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life!!!! The screen saver can't be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet. Apps are ok and to be honest I could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card. I bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than 4 games and the tablet doesn't read it or something. It says sd card inserted but it won't download apps to the sd card!
1,Bought as a gift. Super excited. I hope it lives up to the hype. Can't wait til she unwraps it
1,Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
1,"Easy to set up, and easy to use. Can read in bright sunlight with no glare at all. Performs as advertised. Battery life is exceptional. Will last for 8 to 10 hours on a charge depending on brightness setting.Would recommend this to any avid reader. It is light and will hold hundreds of books."
1,"Works really well have no complaints about this product, I would recommend this product to anyone who ask"
1,I have been so impressed and my kids love it as well.
1,"Paperwhite is everything I had hoped for. Easy to use and perfect screen clarity, regardless of lighting conditions."
1,I Used rely on Siri on the iphone prior to buying this and do not use Siri anymore since I started using Alexa. I activate siri on my phone and address it as Alexa. The voice recognition is awesome compared to any other assistant like Siri. You can speak from any corner in the room and it will capture it. I automated my home with this and we love it.
1,"I got a great price on this item, it was a gift and my mom loves it. Easy to start using on day 1."
1,"Works great, highly recommend. Great alternative to cable"
1,"Even better than the Paperwhite, which have used regularly over the past couple of years."
1,This was my first kindle purchase and I'm glad I waited. The battery life is awesome rarely do I have to charge it. It's also really easy to purchase more books. Also the white pages are easy on the eyes whether it's night or daytime.
1,The Echo is working with no problems and we are still learning new ways and ideas to ask questions about everything and anything. Pleased with the purchase and quality.
1,"I started out crazy hesitant about the product seeming skeptical of the voice recognition being overdramatized. It hears me while a song is very loud. As well as the information pre-downloaded is awesome. Just for music alone it's awesome. Everything else, which is not able to be explained is far beyond worth the money. It's an underpriced item and I plan to buy 1 more."
1,"Purchased this for my wife so she can read in bed at night without disturbing me while I try to sleep. Because of its design, it is more like a book with adjustable lighting, fonts and shadings. She absolutely loves it!"
1,Plays great music and hears you from pretty far away. Simple to set up and makes life a bit easier. New skills being added keeps it new and exciting!
1,"The tablet was great, the performance and the price is excellent."
1,It was really easy to set up. A much more inexpensive alternative to cable television.
1,Great sounding device. Product improvements are constantly being done & more options are being added.
0,i was using the old fire tv but this one is better after all the updates
1,I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options.
1,"Works great, sound is clear and is really loud. Would recommend"
1,My Grandchildren Love Their Tablets! They really really enjoy watching movies & playing games on their tablets.
1,Like that I can choose to get books from Kindle or I can borrow books from my local library.
1,Great for toddlers and preschoolers. My 3 yr old loves it
1,Got this gift for my girlfriend daughter and she loves it good deal thanks
1,"Got my daughter & son in law this for Christmas and my husband really enjoyed it, so I knew this would make a great gift for his birthday. I was very lucky and got the last one at our Best Buy store. Just set it up and having fun with it !!"
1,"I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well."
1,"Replacing 6 year old Kindle, which had begun to malfunction. We were pleasantly surprised to discover the new edition,which is now lighted, cost the exact same price (on sale) that we paid 6 years ago."
1,Great product and Best Buy was the best place to purchase from.
1,The Echo was easy to set up and works wonderfully in the bedroom. So far I've only used it to play music and check the weather. I'm looking forward to exploring all of Alexa's capabilities.
1,"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well."
1,Difficult to convert music files from I-tunes to put on this device and that is why I purchased it. Takes a lot of time to transfer files.
1,This device really allows you to use it for multiple reasons. It's a tablet and kindle all in one. I love this device.
1,Bought this tablet for my nephew its light and pretty inexpensive.
1,It's a great device to have. It does so many things. Very practical.
1,I bought 2 of the Echos and gave one to my wife. She really loves the Echo because the music.
1,"Decent, but have to reset monthly, i have to unplug and at times re enter my pass cause this freezes or stops completely. You can add KODI though. i would still but one for living rm though."
1,"Alexa is pleasant, polite , & very quick to respond to requests such as weather , music , or even jokes ;"
1,"Have been very happy with it. Am using this as the control point for wifi enabled lighting system, sound system tv controls etc"
1,I'm buying two more for my daughters. The tablet has become a useful tool for my family
1,Love being able to ask it just about anything. Especially weather and music.
1,"Amazon makes great products it's that simple ,clean graphics"
0,I was really hoping for this to take place for my phone with my kid. It did not. It works decent to stream videos.
1,"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
1,Works great. But could use more apps and less preloaded junk.
1,Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.
1,"All around useful, enjoy full product. Does exactly as advertised. Will buy more for gifts. Our entire family and friends are amazed."
1,"Alexa really works. I was sceptical at first, now she is part of the family. I'm cooking , I have three different things on the go, microwave, stovetop, and outside on the grill; all need to be pulled off the heat at different times. No problem , I just ask Alexa to set timers for each item as I go along, awesome! Time to watch a movie now , "" Alexa turn off living room lights "" The lights dim and she confirms with ""OK "" - nice. A little bit too warm, "" Alexa, set temperature to 69 "" The air-conditioner comes on ,magical . My nephew does not like what we are cooking, "" Alexa open Domino's "" she asks for my order choice, within seconds Dominos has the order, paid for , arrives on time . This is truly one of the coolest devices I have ever purchased . I almost forgot, anytime I want to hear a piece of music that I loved from my past I just call it out and she can pull it up right there and then I can listen to it, in near Bose quality sound , Magic!!!!"
1,"Thought this would be too advanced for my 3 year old, but she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and learn patience. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept her honest."
1,They make the perfect gift. I give them out to may customers every year.
1,I already have an Amazon Fire Stick and wanted another. I decided to try the Amazon TV. I can say it is much faster in loading both games and shows.
1,"Setup for the Amazon Fire TV box was very easy. I was surprised at how little the box actually was, and just how powerful some of the apps and downloadable games were that you can use on the Amazon Fire TV.I ended up ordering the Amazon Fire TV game controller online at Amazon. I am currently not an Amazon Prime member, but may re-consider that decision in time to get even more functionality out of the box.For anyone looking to buy a relatively cheap device to maximize their TV watching and even Console game playing, look no further than the Amazon Fire TV. Although it does not compare to a Playstation IV or X-Box it does have decent graphics on some of the available games.I had also purchased a class 10 64 GB micro SD card for the Amazon Fire TV Box as well and had no trouble formatting it and getting it setup."
1,I enjoy having this smaller tablet to carry around
0,"I love reading so this e-reader works really well for me. I just wish it was a little bigger. I was used to another e-reader that had a larger screen. Otherwise, it works!"
1,"Great tablets, prefer over the Nabi anyday. Love the color choices"
0,Purchased this product for as a backup tablet. . The one con I have is that the internet browser runs a little slow. Other than that a good product.
0,It's for my kids so I didn't want to spend to much but they down load all the games they want and keeps them busy
1,"these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper."
1,"so many options, such great sound, a great value!!"
1,"This is great I was used to just the plain Kindle and this feels more like a tablet than just a kindle. I use it to check email, do pintrest and read my books. Totally in love with my new Kindle fire!"
1,much more powerful then the stick and the amazon fire tv 1
1,Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
1,"Cord cutter here. We had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our comfort zone. Since we are Prime members, we finally decided to give Amazon Fire TV a shot. We've been using Fire TV for two weeks now and we'll never go back to cable!PROS:Ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which takes up very little space.Simple remote (and a free app so you can turn your cell or tablet into a remote).No buffering issues have yet come up (although that may be because I have a very strong internet connection).Seamless interaction with our Prime Video account and Amazon Music, across all devices. For example, if I download a movie from Prime on my tablet, watch some of it during my commute - when I get home and turn on Fire TV, I can pick up right where I left off from my tablet...seamlessly without having to manually sync.Comes with thousands of channels/apps loaded including all of the the major services we use.Can be used for games (we haven't tried any games yet)The voice command feature is outstanding. Speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it, with multiple options for buying, renting or just viewing for free if available. I've never been a big voice command user with other devices but this one works so well that using it has already become a habit.Using the Amazon Photos app you can instantly upload all of your digital photos from your phone or tablet to your Fire TV for large screen viewing of your photos.CONS: No way to customize the home screen layout (at least no way that I've been able to figure out).OVERALL: I'm kicking myself for not doing this sooner.Read more"
1,"Great battery life, excellent screen to read. Help and directions could be better but still very happy"
1,This is a good tablet. I only gave it 4 stars because it is only 8 go. Otherwise is working well.
1,Is a good table for kids to play with to watch videos and play some games with
1,"was looking at a tablet on sale. saw the kindle-old one quit (on off switch), this one even had a camera. love the whole thing."
1,I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby!
1,"Great tablet for the price especially if you are a Amazon Prime member, very pleased, makes a great gift."
1,Nice device. Wish it was a little bigger. Easy to use and read ebooks.
1,Had to purchase another kindle because my current one had reached its memory capacity.
1,I love the way we can program it for my grands....
1,"Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading."
1,This is not our first Amazon Fire---we have them on every TV in the house (cord cutting) and over the years Amazon products have proven reliable. Best Buy was a great option for purchasing--they met the online price (their everyday price was exact with the online prices I saw) and I didn't have to wait for delivery.
1,"My kids love it, they use it for games, books, etc"
1,This Amazon Fire Tablet is a great tablet and very affordable.
1,"it is a great streaming device with all the apps you need for streaming whatever it is you watch, cut the cable go to streaming it will save a lot of money"
1,"Perfect size ,very useful and my daughter loves it"
1,kindle fire is a great product also caught it at a special price its super fast and takes great photos
1,Great if you don't care about the playstore for android it works fine to me
0,"I bought this tablet for my son. He used it for mainly games. I though he would like reading his books on it but he prefers the actual book vs digital books. It works great, fast, and vibrant colors. I play with it on occasion. It fits in my hand at night and it's larger than my phone but not as expensive as other tablets. All in all it was worth the money."
1,I love to read and this Kindle Paperwhite is great. And being a Bookbub member. I get free books automatically loaded to my Kindle. And borrowing books from the library is eady and trouble free.
1,Wife had the earlier version without the light. This one does the joband lets me go to sleep while she reads. Best money I ever spent to get out of the dog house.
0,"My grand kid didn't like device, get frustrated to navigate education video. Not worth it!"
1,"I bought the Amazon Echo for myself right before Christmas. I ended up returning it because my wife got me one as a Christmas present! It's cool technology, and is fun to play around with, but I think the real value of it is realized if you have compatible home automation products. However, I'm not in that boat yet."
0,Its good to have along with cable. Hopefully you get one as a present and not purchase yourself
1,Now a device that is expandable and everyone in the house can use it. Works smooth. I am going to expand additional devices with this now.
1,"East to use and easy set up. Weather, basic questions and most any music on demand."
1,Love this thing so fast when uploading video can wait to do more with it
1,I have 3 amazon fire sticks already. The box runs a little faster and I haven't experienced any lag times with the menus. The voice control works surprisingly well.
1,i havent had a problem since i been using it. it works great
0,"I have a dot as well as this one. There is never a problem with the dot being able to hear me, but the Echo is like an obstinate child. There is still time to return it so I'll give it a few more days to behave. If not, it goes back."
1,very easy to set up. Works great. Lots of cool features. Love it
1,"This is a great tablet for the price! Purchased for my 10 year old son. He uses to play games, watch movies, read books - pretty much anything. Picture is good too."
1,At the price of $39 you can't go wrong. Great mobile device that is bigger than trying to use phone.
1,"Great device. I use it to answer questions, look up information, play music, for alarms, to take notes and for weather updates. I would recommend this device to my friends and family."
1,"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
1,"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
1,User friendly even for a non-techie person like my mom.
1,bought the tablet for my elderly father who is a avid reader...he loves it!
1,Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
1,Great for kids! It's very easy for them to navigate.
1,I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.
1,Bought this pre-Black Friday as a Xmas gift. Great product at a great price. I look forward to Black Friday at Best Buy every year!
1,Very easy for our children to use and enjoy for road trips.
1,"we have various versions of the kindle and this one is great. the screen quality is amazing and I think it makes this the best Kindle Paperwhite, and the price is great got it for less than a $100 with a best buy member deal"
1,"i bought two of these to gift, but i kind of want to keep them for myself."
1,"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
1,"I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile."
1,"This is a great tablet with all the access you need. It has a decent resolution and can be used to play games, connect on social media, listen to music and watch movies."
1,does everything i need read lots of books from local library check out my email and facebook and hooks up nice to my wirelees
1,This product does exactly what I wanted it to do and is good value for the purchase price.
0,Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
1,Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family
1,Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price.
1,It works
1,"So, we looked at the same tablet set up for kids at $80-$90, got this one for $50 and just installed the kids package. Great potty training tool."
1,My 12 year old loves it. She uses it to watch YouTube and stream music.
0,"No matter what I asked, either Alexa didn't know the answer, or offered to order an item that I didn't ask for, with a prime membership.Couldn't even get my weather forecast right.Kept giving me the forcast for an area 20 miles away.I returned it.By the way, whatever I ask for from"" ok Google"" I get an answer that is usually 99% correct.Never asks me to pay for a $99 membership or offer to order something online for me.Don't need it. Don't want it."
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas! It is a lot more than what I expected! I will probably buy another one for my self
1,I was a little bit hesitant to get the Voyage over the Paperwhite and after holding the two I knew I wanted the Voyage. This device has been perfect! (Advice: Ask Amazon to remove the ads if you're a Prime member!)
1,I cancelled my cable and only use the Amazon Fire .. I can watch my programmes when I feel like and it's easy to use !
1,Bought these for my kids and they love them. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatible.
1,He loves to read so he will enjoy sitting down with it
1,works perfect for my 4k tv and the voice command comes in handy
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandkids and it was so easy to setup and also operate. They liked it so much that I will probably purchase two more so each grandkid will have their own.
1,"When I fist walked into best buy, I thought I was going to get my son a new Samsung. I was nervous about spending that much on a first tablet for a second grader. The sales rep pointed me to the kindle, and i'm glad he did."
1,"If you don't want to pay the extra for the smart tv, add a Amazon Fire Tv, to your tv and you will have a Smart tv. Great for the price."
1,"Amazon had the item sold out so I went to best buy to purchase and they had plenty in Stock, in store, which was great."
1,"My daughter had the fire stick at her home when I went to visit her , I liked it So when I got back home I went and bought the fire tv box due to it having more memory, it works great"
1,My boyfriend absolutely loves his Christmas present !
1,"Traveled for work to an island for 6 weeks. Was great for plane rides there and back, as well as on the island with me always being on the move"
1,Excellent item.
1,Excellent tablet for my grandkids. Durable. Awsome 2 year free replacement if damaged for any reason
1,It's a very nice charger it's fast and effective.
1,"Bought 2 for the kids so they can read and play games. I have bought other tablets under $100 and this one, in my opinion, is the best one for the price."
1,It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
1,Got as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Easy to read in dim lit room plus the battery life on it is amazing
1,"Loving my new Kindle, especially upgrade to having a camera!!"
1,I had been eyeing the Amazon Echo for a while now. Best Buy had a sale for 50% off (normally $199 it was $90) so I jumped on it. I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. It was everything I imagined it would be and more. If I had to do it all over again I would have paid the $199.
1,I love this tablet. It is easy to use. With him is very easy to travel
1,Bought two of them during the Thanksgiving sale for $35 each. I mainly bought them for gifting purpose but used one of them myself and was not disappointed. You get what you pay for but for $35 this is the best gift that someone is going to receive.
1,got this for my mom and she loves it. easy to work
1,No glare ever! Easy process of getting books! Reading is made super easy
1,Don't shop around! Great parental controls. Easy to set up
1,Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
1,Great product love that you can sideload kodi app.
1,Upgraded from an old 2nd gen kindle and this is much better
1,"There are some things that she can't do yet, but she blows Google out of the water... possibilities are endless!! So glad I decided to switch to Alexa...."
1,"I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
1,"I'm an android developer, and as such have owned and operated maybe 20 android devices and 10 iOS devices in the last five years. Honestly, the Fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablets 2-3x its price. I find the UI a bit cluttered- it takes a fair amount of swiping to get where I want, and the home screens stretch on a bit with the default arrangement- but its a wonderful way to read books, check the internet, and do general web browsing. And since its a major name brand tablet , its very easy to find screen protectors and cases at even five below, which fit it perfectly. Too many cheap tablets are such a small, specialized item that you'll never be able to find replacement parts or matching cases. Overall, one of my three favorite devices out of 30 or so."
0,"good product. bought it for somebody else, so i spent little time on it."
1,"i love my Alexa,you can ask this thing anything and it will get you an answer"
1,Very nice to have in the kitchen/living room area Just ask what the weather is The time Play music The news Turn lights on Works great!
1,After using one at a relative's house I finally decided to purchase one of these. I've struggled with the slowness of smart tv built in apps or even the apps on my bluray player and this was finally the solution to that. It's fast and has tons of content.
1,Great gift for my dad who cant get out in the yard anymore like he used to. He's not tech savvy but he got used to the kindle pretty quickly.
1,This came in the recommended bundle and works well.
1,I have plenty of Firesticks. This is an upgrade. Lets me stream faster because it has a faster processor. Family loves it. It knocks down the cable bills.
1,I love the echo. I can get news weather and even a joke.
1,Bought this tablet one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They seem to enjoy it a lot.
1,Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
1,"For the money, this is one of the nicest Kindle Readers I have seen. This is so powerful, I can do a lot more than read books."
1,this worked real well. very satified.i was able to download other apps too
1,This thing does everything and only 49 bucks I use it everyday
1,"This is my third Amazon Fire tablet, and it is definitely an upgrade from my two-year-old 7-inch Fire HD. I love that it has a card slot and both front and rear-facing cameras."
1,"I enjoyed it, looking forward to adding more things that are compatible with it"
1,This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!
1,Really enjoying the Echo. There are a ton of features that we are still learning so it will be a while before we understand its full capabilities.
1,No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
0,"Not what I was thinking, most questions asked, I get response. Hmm"
1,Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage.
1,"I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve."
1,This is a newer version of the Fire I had previously and I love it. I like the camera. This version is lighter than the other. It is taking me a while to learn the differences but most of them are improvements.
0,Can't be it for $34 to use it on the plane for the kids. Scrolling down is kinda sluggish compared to my phone.
1,I use my Amazon Fire almost every day. So much easier to carry the Fire versus books!
1,I bought this as a gift and my wife enjoys using this new kindle fire. we have had the original version of the kindle tablet and this new version works quicker and more efficiently. Happy with the kindle tablet!!
1,My wife uses this to watch our diabetic 5 year olds sugar levels through the website we have set up
1,"When I first opened the box, I was unsure as to my feelings about this new Kindle. BUT, after learning to use it, the performance has been first rate. The variable brightness makes it easy on the eyes to read day or night."
1,I bought it for my fianc and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
1,This is a product that provides a great value. It serves its purpose for the price I paid for it and seems to work well.
1,"I've had a previous Kindle before, and it needed to be replaced. I'm glad I put it off...until this gem happened to come out. I still can't believe that for the price of a random, often low quality tablet (done that too) you get...a KINDLE. Yes, it's a smaller screen and not quite HD like I've been spoiled with, but the resolution is still fantastic, the speed is amazing, and customer service if it needs to be looked at has a turn around of 2-3 days... (I had a minor issue with preparing of microSD apps being slow, but I just decided to deal with it.)"
1,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality."
1,Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
1,Needed a new one.. the dog ate my old one
1,Bought the unit as it has apps that allow for linking my Sling TV device and freeing up my IPad and Apple TV all in one box.
0,"I understand you get what you pay for but come on Amazon. You make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. The only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust. In my opinion, if any company is going to integrate the AndroidOS at least make it user friendly and 100% open. It's basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device."
0,Got this as a gift for a friend. She had a little issue trying to set up at first but got it going eventually
1,"I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them."
1,This is great for reading. I can adjust font and brightness. I can also access email and download apps. Sometimes it is slower than I'd like but for A inexpensive option it's not bad at all. I bring it with me all the time
1,Amazon Echo (aka Alexa) might be the best AI standalone device on the market (yes I know google Home is available now) because she connects to over 50% of my apps (as she has Hundreds of apps connected)...google Home is cool but Alexa is the OG lol
1,I wish i could find more free books instead of Amazon purchase.
1,"This is a great tablet, especially if you're a Prime Member. Only drawback is the ads."
1,Great for reading in low and bright light. Easy to download books
1,"my kids love the games and browsing the web, perfect for a gift."
1,Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.
1,I got it because it's my mom's favorite color. It's got some powerful speakers. I can hear her on it from two rooms away
1,Gave as a gift - recipient was thrilled with their new Echo.
1,"Like it, it's easy to navigate have no problem. I recommend it to a friend or family."
1,"After receiving another extremely high cable bill, I decided to cut the cord! The Amazon Fire is awesome. We subscribed to Playstation Vue which has an app on the Fire that you can access.We can also access our Amazons and Netflix accounts right from the Fire. Great product, wish I would have done this sooner."
1,Works very well. Easy to use and Straightforward.Would recommend it to anyone.
0,It works. Not as user friendly as roku. Not as many apps as roku. No google play store.
1,"Fun, to work on new task and ask random questions."
1,"For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
1,Great for kids. Simple to use and a variety of apps.
1,I purchased this Fire tablet for my wife because her other tablet had ceased to function. It is a good tablet for what she needs it for and she likes the ease of use. I would certainly recommend this tablet!
1,"The Amazon Fire - 7 tablet is a terrific tiny tablet for the awesome price of $50. I can easily access the Internet wherever there is free WiFi. I can carry oodles of books with me wherever I go. It's fast, sleek, lightweight, already loaded with apps I want to use, and a steal at the price! I don't have a smart phone by choice and find that the Fire-7 meets my needs sufficiently."
1,"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose."
1,"It has a clear screen, the books are easy to download, I like the other features as well."
1,Love it I can stream all the stuff that I want to see. Catching up on the shows that's no longer on tv is so cool. I also have amazon prime so I can watch certain movies. Best purchase ever.
1,"Echo was very easy to set up, even for someone less then tech savvy. Works great with Philips Hue & Sirius xm."
1,"Works excellent with Playstation's VUE service. Pushes Amazon content pretty hard so if you don't have a PRIME membership it may get annoying. Ditched cable and picked up the FireTV box, couldn't be happier."
1,"I have a tablet, but needed a reader that I can read in sunny locations and not worry about loosing and expensive item. This Kindle is perfect to carry everywhere, light and convenient the screen is smaller than I anticipated but not bad for the price."
1,"Not quite as easy to navigate as my old Kindle. If I press on a word to look it up sometimes I'm not able to return to where I was. Also, I have not had an instance where highlighting a character name and using x-Ray gives a description of the character; it only skips to references of the name that are contained in the book. In spite of these few shortcomings I think it's a great product."
1,"I love this device, what I like is the parental controls with the apps that kids want to explore and download it could be dangerous, but its not. Also this has the capability of having a 128 gb memory card. With the features of Amazon that means access to underground games and the ability to download shows and movies. This is a great product for beginners and the advanced."
0,"Found this tablet to be very intrusive with adds, almost forced to use credit card to make things work."
1,I'm not computer savy but so I like simple things and this was absolutely no problem setting up and using! Best electronic I've every owned :)
1,This is the coolest! Love it as do my young kids. We are adding skills every day and continue to add devices such as the nest thermo and the lifx bulbs
1,great product for home use and set up.............................
1,This is what I have been waiting for. This HD10 Kindle is Super!
1,"Amazing use for many purposes. Ask Alexa to set alarms, play pandora, and weather anytime. Well worth the money. I use it even more than I anticipated. ♡♡"
1,"Easy to use,battery lasts forever, and Compatible with public library downloads to amazon"
1,The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it
1,"This box is the best,great apps,memory is powerful.Better than apple tv"
0,gets the jib done. makes for a good tablet for the kids to play on
1,"I love it so and so my kids.They r enjoying playing the educational games, and watching cartoons."
1,"Bought this for a friends as a housewarming gift, and it was hit! My friend was able to set it up in minutes and was thrilled about it."
1,Love this product! Takes clear photos. Easy access to internet. Tons of apps to choose from. Everything you could need in a tablet is here!
1,totally satisfied with performance of tablet. I would recommend to friends and family.
1,My 3 year old daughter loves playing on her fire. The apps are all very entertaining and easy enough for her to use.The only thing I have had difficulty with is accessing youtube or the internet.
1,These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
1,"Previously used Kindle app on phone and tablet to read kindle books. But the readability on the Kindle itself is much better. Less strain on eyes and more natural to read for extended time. Plus, the light weight and easy handle-ability is great!"
1,"We had tried in the past to use Netflix an it just wouldn't work, so I tried again after we got the firestick and it works perfectly. Occasionly there are some times where it cannot find a server, but for the most part it works great."
1,The Fire Stick is easy to setup and use you will love it
0,It came with dead pixels so i was very disappointed. i called then they replaced it. I ended up returning it completely because it was too slow.
1,This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
1,"My Echo is such a helpful assistant! She turns the lights on and off, tells me the weather, plays my favorite music, finds recipes, wakes me when I set an alarm, and helps me relax and sleep with meditation music. I have one in the living room and a a Dot in the bedroom."
1,"he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great"
1,Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.
1,I absolutely love the fire tv box... It's amazing!
1,"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks."
1,Great for kids games and just basic tablet stuff like music and movies
1,The tablet is about worth what you pay for it. But that's what happens when you only pay 50.
1,"I sometimes find the store a little intimidating, and certainly overwhelming. I don't always know what I want beforehand. My existing Surface failed in far to short a time frame, and since I really only used it to read I was able to replace its functions with a kindle fire, and I am actually much happier with it."
1,Bought this tablet for our 6 year old son for Christmas to play games and take pictures along with a unicorn beetle defender case and it has totally exceeded our expectations! Totally worth the little bit of money you spend!
1,"Upgraded to this from the Fire TV Stick, it's twice as powerful than the stick. I liked it a lot and got 3 of my coworkers on them and they love it. Great for travel, a dorm room & for not paying on extra cable/satellite boxes and their monthly vig."
1,Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
1,Great little tablet! The expandable memory makes this quite a bargain!
1,"Bought one, loved it. Bought another so I would have one in the bedroom and the other for living room. Also bought one for my sister."
1,All the grandchildren I have purchased these for get alot of use from them and love the games.
1,"I bought this because of the low price on Black Friday. My aging eyesight was making it difficult to read my original Kindle. And, I have gotten spoiled by my other products with touch screen. Thrilled I bought this because can see to read at night again and touch screen is nice. The light is not too bright, so does not cause headaches for me."
1,Picture quality is great and wide variety of features
1,I can't say enough great things about the Fire HD. At it's low cost you can still do almost everything a $600 IPAD can do. If you want a great tablet at a low cost look no further than Amazon Kindle Fire's.
1,It has parental controls and it has great picture quality. It also let's you download educational games for kids to learn on.
1,Bought this tablet as a gift and I might end up buying one for myself.
1,good product
1,"Works great and provides everything you need. Love the parental controls, color, screen, and camera functions. Very easy for setup."
1,"The Fire 7 interface is much better the Kindle Fire 7 which has had problems with email. The interface is similar to a smart phone which offers a learning opportunity for novice smart phone users. I both this Fire 7 for Rose because of similar interface and her older Kindle was presenting problems.The downside is the ads that pop-up when it awakes from sleep mode, but you can't beat the price. This unit makes a great gift and two of our friends have purchased the Fire 7."
1,"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
1,Sure you can get this app on all devices but try reading those screens in the sun. This reader does the trick
1,I needed something to control my home alarm and smart gadgets easily and this definitely covers it.
1,would recommend it to any one. great device to have at home or office
1,"Get system, cannot see anyone not having one or two in their home. Easy to use, great features, a lot a movies available to stream."
1,it is as good as it has been advertised like using a desktop!
1,I brought this tablet for my 5 year old nephew. For 50.00 He can stay off mine and enjoy Netflix and you tube. Plus it has parental control. Greatest gift ever!
1,"Although my young grandchildren love it, we are disappointed. Many of the questions we ask Alexa, she can't answer. They weren't obscure questions nor complicated."
1,I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips.
1,This item is very impressive and informative. Helpful for the working people always trying to utilize their time .
1,"I am a HUGE Amazon Fan. I have ( 3 X ) Amazon Fire Tablets I have ( 2 X ) Amazon Fire TVS the 1st and 2nd Generation, I am an Amazon Prime Member, I have the Echo and the Dot. The Amazon Echo is amazing, it works extremely well - especially if you have Prime. The Echo sounds great for its size I would say the only saw back is the Base could sound a little better. BUT all in all I am very happy with this product."
1,I've been a kindle app user for years. I am happy that I finally got the kindle paperwhite. Love it! Thanks Best Buy for price matching.
1,"Great little tablet for the price, It does everything I need it to do. It has tons of apps, easy to set up and use."
1,Great lightweight tablet you can carry around anywhere
1,This is a great reading tool. Works great under strong light
1,"Has a great alarm clock functionality -- know that sounds silly but it's awesome to be able to set your alarm with your voice. And you can play music before bedtime and put on a sleep timer, which is awesome.The news roundups in the morning are also nice for while you get ready.Interested to see where it goes!"
1,If you can jail break it. It will be a nice product
1,"I bought it to have at work, since it is small and affordable. The picture quality is great and the sound as well. My tablet has turned into the office music source on day there isn't anything good on the radio."
1,I love this tablet. It is great for indoor reading as well as outdoors. The back lighting makes it ideal for indoor spaces that are not well lit.
1,This item has allowed me to eliminate my cable. I love having any movie I want at my fingertips.
1,"Great asking headline news, weather and stock quotes. Play Pandora often too. Wish it would work when unplugged."
1,"While the design is a little industrial for my taste, it does blend into a room pretty well. The home automation integration is nice too, especially the integration with the Logitech Harmony remote. I love being able to turn things on and off with my voice. Another great feature is the music playback. Alexa has a song for every occasion! Finally, it's kinda fun to talk to. My niece came over and talked to it for hours one day... Go figure! Give it a try!"
1,You can't beat $50 for a usable media consumption tablet. Play games or watch video without pauses or skips.
1,Love my Echo. Alexa is fun to talk to and play with.
1,I can read it outside in the sunshine and get a tan and enjoy a good book!!!
0,"Overall the tablet is okay, I just paid 50$ so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. No google, no youtube, gmail!"
1,"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
1,Easy to set up. Very responsive. Excellent sound quality.
1,Very easy to use and worth every penny! I would recommend this to anyone who needed smart tv capabilities.
1,this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
0,"This is a good tablet, next time I buy a tablet I will get a bigger one. It does all we need it to. Great for kids!"
1,Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
1,Bought for wife and she loves it and has already used it
1,Everything and more that I imagined!! LOVE LOVE LOVE my echo
1,Has everything you want in the product . But doesn't have Wi-Fi
1,A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!
1,Great for the price you can not beat this kindle fire l
1,"I got it to gift my niece , they should be very happy to get it. Product looks good , All the features like screen , camera , processing speed is good for the money you get it."
1,"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
1,"I bought this Fire tv because I have unsmart tv that I would like to watch Netflix in, and I think it was a good thing to do and it is not expensive"
1,I bought this for my daughter as a replacement from a broken tablet it's very easy to use for my child
0,I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
1,"This tablet is great at what it does:Netflix, Amazon, and general Internet searches. It obviously does other things and for the price it's fantastic."
1,Easy to use and meets all my expectations for why I bought it.
0,Good for a basic entry tablet. Plus u can upgrade the memory on it which is a plus.
1,"The Amazon Echo is worth the cost for the speaker feature alone. I love the ease of being able to tell Alexa what music to play. While I mostly used Alexa for playing music, my whole family enjoys asking her questions. Additionally, the shopping list feature is useful. I look forward to learning about the many ways we can integrate Alexa's skills into our everyday lives."
1,Good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on Xbox games with 7 other Siblings
1,"A great buy as a second wife to my husband! She has all the answer without the smart mouth, she listen and most of all she shut's her mouth!"
1,It was a awesome gift to give to someone special to enjoy
1,"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
1,Good sound quality and a nice selection of skills that it can learn including radio shows
0,"I ended up returning this tablet. For the price, $40, the tablet performed very well. However, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the Amazon lineup. The iPads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost $$$$. From what I've experienced, the Samsung Tab A line is a solid tablet for a $$ budget. You can often find one on sale for ~$150 and its a pretty good bang-for-the buck.If the money is your ONLY concern, then this will probably work well enough for you."
1,... in confined spaces. The kids room does work fine
0,"I just used this after receiving it a few days. I tried a couple times to use it, but my Kindle registered connected to a low power charger. Too expensive for this to happen. I've never written a negative review till now."
0,Good for the price. A very basic tablet with basic functionality
1,I have owned a Echo Dot and Wand prior to purchasing the Echo. Based on my experience with all of the gadget I have to say that they are all very useful. Alexa is not perfect but does most of the things I want it to do well.
1,Easy way for my family to stream music and videos over our speakers. APPs are a hassle a lot of the time and limited storage capacity.
1,Great product. Speed and quality is awesome. Easy to use. My kids are able to navigate to there favorite programs.
1,I really like this new toy. Have not completely got it all set up to everything but so far it has been a lot of fun playing with it and getting it set up.
1,"got five of these at black friday, great price and deal, worth the money"
1,I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase.
1,This box is amazing very fast smooth interface kid friendly at a great price
1,Perfect
1,Faster processor and instant response time. Works as advertised. Way ahead then Roku on features and offering.
1,Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles
1,I really love the tablets my kids love them.I recommend then to other people.
1,My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
1,I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
1,This thing is not half bad for the price. Bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it.
1,"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
0,Works pretty good but it's slow or glitchy. Either way it's good for the price.
1,"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
1,I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
1,"Setup was self explanatory. It doesn't take a genius. I have had the Echo Alexa for nearly a month and love everything about it. I have a rather large log home and decided to add the inexpensive smaller version called Echo Dot to the kitchen to be sure I could turn the smart lights on/off/dim without having to yell through the walls into the room where the Echo Alexa is located. Alexa did work the distance, but I had to yell to penetrate through the walls for the lights on the other side of the house. As a team, they both work like a charm. There is so much still to discover about Echo Alexa/Echo Dot and there have been more and more apps and accessories added to the list just in the short time I have had it. Love it and discover more and more things about it as people are experimenting and posting things about it online. Worth every penny."
0,Very limited. Have activate skills.. a little bit of a pain. Otherwise fun to mess with her. Will learn as we go. Have used go control lights and other. Works ok.
1,"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
1,This device is awesome. This was the first box we bought that allowed us to download whatever apps we wanted. The first apple tv didn't allow that. I also love that it is android and therefore much more open than apple. Amazon has a decent amount of stuff with prime that adds to netflix and hulu if you are into watching shows by the season.
1,Very fast and tons of apps to download with plenty of space to store them.
1,This FireTV has more streaming options than many of the other devices I have tried. It is now a mainstay in my home.
1,"this is my 2nd hd 8, very fast and easy, great value"
1,I love my Kindle! It is one of the best Christmas gifts I've received in a long time. It's the ideal version of a book electronically. It's light weight and easy on the eyes. I recommend this Kindle to anyone that loves to read but isn't thrilled about carrying around a hard back or paper book.
1,I love my new Kindle. Light weight and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone.
1,"This is a great virtual assistant, learning new skills everyday. Works perfectly with my Nest thermostat."
1,Simply put its exactly what I expected. I've had zero problems with it
1,"Entertaining, great sound. We enjoy using daily and it is very informative!"
1,"As a gift for a friend, it works very well for the countries which have corresponding Amazon service such as China."
1,You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
1,use for travel light in weight makes reading so easy
1,"Got one of these for my 3 yr old nephew and 2 yr old niece. They are just the right size, durable and a good price point."
1,"I loved the variety of colors available for the tablet. It's been dropped a few times and thankfully is still in tact, with the exception of a few scratches. My son loves it."
1,Bought an Amazon Fire Reader and it is great. I am able to read books and take it wherever I go.
1,This is an amazing item happy I purchase Alexa I highly recommend
1,This is a great tablet because of all the preloaded games and ability to add more for free. It keeps my kids entertained and is the best for learning.
1,We bought three of these while on sale. They replace my ereader and my children's ipod touches and we use them every day. I cannot stress how good of a deal this is! While the display isn't the best - you're getting far mor than what you pay for.
1,"I love my reader. I love that I can read outdoors, and I can choose the size and the font of the text. I love the new battery life! It is for real. I can go 10 days without a charge; in fact I've never run out of power and had it off the power for 12 days. The only thing I wish, is that it were just a little bit larger. But I love everything else about it. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good reader."
1,"One of my best purchases yet...I have always been an apple person(still am), but this tv box is great. You can do so much with it. I just ordered a gaming controller for this unit. I have amazon prime and can watch so many tv shows and movies as well as listen to music. Great all around unit."
1,This is a must have if you have an amazon prime membership!!
1,"I got this on black friday for unbelievable price of $32. It doesn't have much space internally but with a sdhc card you can add up over 100 gigs.Amazon has its own browser and it was very easy to set up. If you want a decent tablet , that you don't expect too much from then this is it."
1,Easy to use size is great display is great in all lighting conditions
1,This is the 4th tablet I have bought for my 10-year-old son over the past few years. He is just rough with the. I made sure to purchase the rubber cover and I am set. There is plenty of space on the tablet for him to keep the fun apps that he likes. He is managing well with it. Glad I purchased it.
1,"we got this for my mom for Christmas so she can play games. It is absolutely perfect for her, as it is bigger than her phone & she can see it much better."
0,"After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg"
1,For the price she got a nice tablet tha she can use for games pics and videos
1,Thought it couldn't get any better than my Fire Stick.. Turns out it can be faster!
1,Great e reader especially love the backlight. Definitely recommend to others
1,"Light, easy to read, large capacity and multiple ways to turn pages. What else can I say, it's a wonderful reader, especially in the Florida sunlight. Also, the iPhone app that sync your ready progress is great for times you have your phone but not the kindle."
1,The backlight feature was what I was looking for for reading in the dark. Highly recommended.
0,"Amazon Kindle needs to put more effort in their tablets, not a lot of applications compatible with the Amazon OS but for 50 dlls is totally worth."
1,Bought this gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. Very easy to order amazon products
1,"This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price!"
1,What a Buy at sale price..Keyboard functions smoothly. Commands transfer without jitters.
1,"I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails."
1,very good for an e-reader. does everything i want it to.
1,"very interesting device, but having to touch button is a pain sometimes.if that would bother you, then go with Echo."
1,My son loves his tablet. He proudly proclaims to everyone he meets to check out his cool tablet. He especially loves the Freetime app.
1,"Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs"
1,I am still learning how to use some of the seemingly limitless capabilities of this device. I will soon be connecting my lights and fans to control by voice commands.
1,"I found the echo easy to use, just wished it had a wireless version"
1,Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.
1,The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.
1,I purchased this to put in my ShowroomEvery customer that comes in remarks about how great the sound is and the station we have on from pandora
1,I was not expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised by both the speed and ease of use.
1,Fire TV has all the apps I need to use. It has games and movies you can watch on it. The remote has a microphone command to find things on the TV.
0,Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.
1,Absolutely love the Echo! So helpful and fun at the same time. Love the voice activation!
1,Was bought as a gift. the person says that it works great and they say that does just what they wanted it to do and it is liked it really well.
1,"This readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag. Easy to use, controls for children are very effective. Am glad I bought it."
1,"Absolutely love this tablet! Its so much more than I thought it would be. Fadt, easy to use and set up for a tablet virgin. I love the kid profiles, setting up a time limit for the day and a curfew time (tablet shuts off), and was simple to do.movies,books,games,entertainment, web browsing, and much much more. I highly recommend this device for first timers and the experienced alike. DO IT! ,GET ONE. My only regret is that i didnt get two"
1,"My first e-reader, and I have been filling it up fast. Great for travel!"
1,This tablet is great for a kid or it is amazing in quality for $49.99
0,Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
1,bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
1,I purchased these for my grandchilden and they have really enjoyed using them and downloading new games to play.
1,Amazing product and very useful I love it !! I recommend
1,It's okJust okHate the ads and the home screenNot as good as original
1,this was a great gift for the kids. We are going on a vacation and The amazon fires are a great tool for them to download games and search the web while we are traveling..thanks
1,I really like this tablet because of the awesome resolution.
1,Would be lost without my kindle and kindle unlimited spend lots of time reading
1,"I bought this tablet the kindle fire7 for my woman and she absolutely loves it, works flawless for all her needs,very well made, does not come across as a cheap tablet a absolute must buy for 49.99! Best $50 tablet on the market hands down better than some I spent much more money on and in fact should I need one myself currently have a insignia flex8 16gb I will buy one for me. Great tablet for kids as well for $50 and the reliability great buy!"
1,My first tablet purchase & is perfect for my needs. Very easy to operate.

1,I got this tablet as a Christmas gift for my wife. She has really enjoyed using it. I get tickle at her playing games on it. You got to remember she is 65 years young! :-)
1,great fun to use easy I used it to automate my house and set my schedule
1,Great tool to have when you need a quick answer for a lot
1,"I thought this would be a fun toy to have around but it has become much more. I have a home automation system in my home and I continiasly need to find my control panel or bust out my phone, which to be honest is somewhat fustrating.Via Alexa I was able to control everything in my home including my nest which is awesome.Only drawback is price. Its somewhat pricy for what it is."
1,"At first it was fun to ask, ""Alexa what's the weather......"". As I add home automation that Alexa can control I will see where it will be a tool vs a novelty."
1,"Good tablet, well made. The screen is not HD which makes some text look pixelated and not as crisp as you would expect. Great for simple reading."
1,Got this at members pricing sale to replace as for. Can't be happerier with quality of sounds
1,Bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. The Amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. I like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met FIRST. Unit needs more on board memory however. Make sure to buy an sd card to expand.
1,Having a charger for my Kindle Paperwhite makes certain that I am charging the Kindle with the proper charging power.
1,Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
1,a must have item. it is good for reading e books..
1,Excelente.
1,Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture
1,I do not regret making this purchase. So many movies and shows to choose from. Bang for your buck
1,I love my Kindle. The screen looks the same as the Voyager to my eyes. Couldn't imagine traveling without it!
1,"The Echo looks good. It is the same as the EchoDot except the speaker is much better. It is very handy for finding and playing music. The App gives you lots of suggestions for queries, and we're having a good time with it."
1,Great for reading in bright sunlight or night settings. Must for avid readers.
1,It is a great product for entertaining. Love Alexa on this but wish it would work with the echo
1,This is a great little kids tablet. Has a lot of features and is really fun to use.
1,Love the echo she is awesome her jokes are something else.......
1,Have had it for a week now and works great.
1,I bought this tablet for my mother-in-law. She loves it! It was the best rated tablet for the price and is a quality product. Does everything she needs.
1,Great for everything when your hands are full and if you like to multitask.
1,It is nice product. I like the design very helpful product
1,"I bought it for my husband as a Vday gift but we both use it. We really like, It's very helpful I wish I could play music more easily"
1,I wish i had known about this product sooner works great.
1,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing."
1,Excellent for any book lover PLUS it is great for outdoor use as well as.people who have a challenge with using an ipad type tablet due to the screen blink that can't be noticed due to the speed but is a killer for the eyes.
1,Very convenient item to use. Easy to read ebooks and came with one month of Amazon Prime.
1,"To be honest, I think the Fire TV is a way better investment than Apple TV. Highly recommended!"
1,I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice.
1,Good item for children and is very inexpensive. Easy to hold and has a cover designed for it.
1,"I bought this for my parents and they use it for everything. Music, weather, scores of the games... they love it"
1,"My first purpose was to use the tablet for taking photos cuz the boyfriend got a new Samsung. This item was in the right price range and I was not aware BestBuy sold the KINDLE FIRE - and was not aware is does more than download books, too. It is much faster to get online WiFI - much better than a pc. I have pleasantly surprised at the many uses the Fire has. I have found myself playing games on it & normally I do not play any on the PC - so if I am watching tv, I can sit here with inexpensive entertainment. Light weight, easy to carry, quick to use for camera(all kinds of settings-who knew) - Right price. Great for sending and receiving email. I suggest getting a 'stylus' for using with keyboard- and one may adjust the 'font' size for easy reading - Enjoy!"
1,Very happy with this purchase.
1,"I love it, it is easy to read on and a nice size screen for the kids to watch movies on"
1,"Love the Kindle! Does not need any light,fits in my purse,lightweight!!"
1,Nice product. Reading made easy. Bought it for a friend.
1,"I have 2 grandsons that have been wanting a tablet, so on Christmas Day they are going to be so happy!"
1,I bought one for my lil 2yr old and I absolutely love it. I can take it on the go and it's an easy and practical device for my lil one to use.
1,great tablet for the price ! my 9 year old daughter loved it !!
1,"We love being able to watch Netflix using this. We used the ps3 before and that was a hassle. We use the fire tv downstairs where we don't have cable. Some apps cost money, but there are some that you can watch free."
1,"Is a great tablet for the kids to play games,learning stuff,you tube and cartoons love this table"
1,This is for a present. I have one of these for myself and love it!
1,Only have such deal during holidays. It is a must buy
1,"Bought this for my son, it's been through some stuff and still going strong"
1,"Bought 2 during Black Friday, great for the price! Don't expect it to be an iPad but for regular use and price, you can't beat it!"
1,Just what I needed.
1,Average good 4 playibg games has a tendency to freeze
1,I got this for a friend so she could use the internet and have more entertainment. I was happy with the cost.
1,Best streaming device on the market today. Amazon is a good company.
1,Quick streaming and 4k capable make this device perfect.
1,This fire tv is an excellent streaming device. One of the best things about it is it is able to stream 4K big upgrade over the fire stick if you have a 4K tv. Also the micro sd card slot is nice to have. It is also very compact. The one thing you will need to pick up is an HDMI cable it doesn't come with one.
1,This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
1,Purchased two for my 8 yr old twins. They love them and the tablets have held up under their abuse. Only issue was not being able to fully block purchasing. Lots of in app amazon ability.
1,Pretty much that.. had to connect straight to router so side loading would be faster.. also video quality can drop with wifi.. Ethernet is the way to get every little cent that this device has to offer..
1,Its a great tablet. Its our 4th one for family purchased.
1,"I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!"
1,Really great and very clear and good reading just great
1,I like it I got it for my nephew birthday now I can get it out off his hands
1,Very easy to set up and use. Has good sound when playing music. I'm going to buy another one.
1,Love it. Really light weight so easy to carry in my purse and read books on it during my daily commute on the train
1,This is really cool. Having fun with it and learning Spanish from it!
1,Works very well. Much better operating system than other cheap tablets. It has a quality feel as well.
0,"Slow connecting, basic model, still a good product just not very advanced"
0,just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon
1,I observe my 4 year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease. She is able to play some of the games and upload movies. Her mom had to put a secret password for the movies because she downloaded some that you had to pay for!
1,"Alexa wakes me up every morning and with out having to turn light on to see clock can just ask, Alexa what time is it, plus can do so much more, such as play songs from play list etc. worth the money!"
1,As time goes on I learn more ways to use the Echo.
1,Went with the portable unit for travel. Easy access and portability.
1,Love the screen colors and the easy accessible apps and internet.
1,"I prefer the deficated e-readers to tablets for reading. I have both this Paoerwhite and a current-gen Nook Glow Light. I really like the Glow Light  especially its rugged construction  and I still use it, but the Paperwhite is better.The Glow Light has no bevel and a touch-sensitive button on the front. This means I am constantantly turning the page or returing to the home screen by accident. It's very annoying, and I have a hard time finding a comfortable way to hold it. It seems like I'm always thinking about where my fingers are. I do not have this problem at all on the Paperwhite.The Paperwhite is a great little reader for the money. I would definitely buy another."
1,grandson really enjoys this and plays with it all the time
1,"I researched about tablets and based on my interests I choose the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and protector, I wanted reading and games mostly."
1,Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
1,This tablet is a great buy. Very happy with it. Has many great features. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Will buy another for my grand daughter. I'm still learning all the great apps etc... Thanks so much.
1,I originally bought the echo dot and took it back immediately to get the bigger speakers. It takes some time getting used to giving commands (word for word or it will not understand you). Use it play music and run multiple activities by voice commands. Would def get and/or recommend if you can get one when/if they go on sale again.
1,"Got tablet for my daughter, very happy with product features. Easy to navigate and my daughter loves it."
1,"Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money."
1,My daughter uses hers for college books. Best gift
1,"You can go cheap and get the fire stick, but for $60 more this is worth it. Ignore the bad reviews, as in October 2015 when it was released it had several software bugs which are now fixed. I did my homework on media devices and the newest Roku & Apple TV's doesn't compare to this Fire TV box. The only thing you'll get semi better luck with is the Nvidia shield, but you'll also pay almost $100 more for it versus this fire tv box."
1,Best E-reader on the market. Screen is crisp and clear and everything just works great
1,"I enjoy using the Echo to tell me a joke, stream some music or answer a question. I find it useful for setting timers, alarms or turning on/off lights."
1,I use it a lot everyday to control my lights (with TP-LINK bulbs)Setup was extremely easy. it understands me better than Siri
1,Very happy customer. My daughter loves using this.
1,great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
1,This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings
1,"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc."
1,Haven't had time to play with it but am enjoying the music and some of the quizzes we played during a party
1,We purchased this TV for a guest room/office. It has an excellent picture and great sound.
1,One of the best items I have bought! Just wonderful we use it all the time.
1,My grandson always enjoyed my kindle so when I saw the 7 inch Kindle on sale before Christmas I knew he would love it.
1,"I loved my Amazon Kindle Fire so much, I purchased one for every member of my family for Christmas. Great for all ages, 8 to 84."
1,This tablet you can download apps and games and the front and rear camera let you captured good picture and video.
1,Great response and quick navigation on this device make it a pleasure to use. Software updates frequently keeping your device up to date. Fire tv is extremely user friendly with a nice layout.
1,Works great and very happy with it. We arte going to get another soon. We used zip ties on the back of a TV so you don't even know I it there. I prefer to add this to a TV then buy a smart TV.
1,I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price.
1,I had been using a smaller adapter for my Kindle Fire HD for about a year and was told by Amazon I needed this charger. I have had it for a week and I believe they were correct. This new charger is faster and more powerful than any I have had before.This is the latest and newest charger that Amazon sells and has a 9 watt charge.This model is a rounded version of the heavy duty charger. I am very happy with mine.
1,Love the amazon fire. I definitely recommend this product
0,"Not user friendly. Sluggish, confusing, and extremely frustrating. Returned the item."
1,This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
1,"Okay, I think it's okay for a beginner. I would recommend this product too a friend."
1,"I purchased this to read books and check out ebooks from the library. I love it and it's easy to use. This is in color and you can even play games on it. It's small enough to fit in my purse so while I'm at appointments I can read and if my son gets board, he can play games."
0,Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it
1,I bought this to control devices in my home (i.e. Phillips Hue lights and Harmony logitech remote). It is a great tablet for the price and easy to use.
1,"I have been wanting a tablet and numerous family members suggested the Amazon Fire tablet. I was afraid that the 7"" size would not be large enough but it is working out perfectly for me! It's size makes it extremely easy to carry and the graphics are amazing. I am sooo happy that I decided to get this tablet. It truly is a (forgive the pun) ""Best Buy"""
0,"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
0,I can't seem to be able to hook it up with my internet connection. I will be returning it to the store.
1,It is a common sense thing. It is fun to use. I am going to try the home house stuff but haven't got that far yet
1,This is one for the living room. And my other one Is for travel one.
1,This product has been amazing! We got a great deal on the purchase and we have not been disappointed with it's productivity!
1,"Being a dedicated Apple user (with an iPhone, iPad mini, and MacBook Air), I didn't except to buy an android or Fire (which uses an OS very built on Android) tablet. But with this Fire tablet being sold for just $40 during the holidays, and some of the Google apps (I was most interested in Play Music) offering different functionality on Android/Fire tablets than on iOS devices, I thought I'd give it a try. After using it for 6 weeks, I can say the Fire is easily worth more than $40. It looks great, works well, and is light and easy to handle. The downsides are that the OS seems a little slower than iOS on my iPad, and the wireless router doesn't seem to be as powerful."
1,I bought this for my 8 year old son and he loves it.
1,It's a great tablet for the price. .I love the idea of shopping from my tablet.
1,loves it perfect for kids sound quality picture perfect
1,Need to get rid of cable.... one step closer. Great content.
1,"My son's Kindle Fire finally quit, I was happy to see it in such fun colors at a great price to replace the old one."
1,Quality comes with apps installed durrible love the case
1,I really like my kindle. I do wish it had so that you could move books that you had read to another area or just mark them as read. I read a lot and sometimes forget if I read the book. It holds so many books and I can take them all anywhere.
1,"Alexa is helpful with the weather, sports updates, and music dancing during a party. Thank you Alexa. You even gave us some historical facts and dinner recipe ideas."
1,I love this!! I have the Apple TV also but find the amazon fire tv easier to navigate
1,Gave the Amazon Echo for my grandson for Christmas. He is still excited about all of its features. He talks about how good it is and want it does all the time.
1,Bought this for my aunt who could no longer enjoy reading books due to her very poor vision and she loves it. The only problem she has is when unwanted windows pop up; she's not very tech-savvy and doesn't know how to get rid of them.
1,Great product easy to use . Even my kids 8/10 can use it !
1,This is a great purchase. We are enjoying Alexa. She is the greatest.
1,"The value of this device is amazing​, the battery life could use some work tho"
1,The Kindle Fire is a great tablet and reader. Everything you need in a tablet at a much lower price.
1,"The amazon fire tv is a really good streaming unit. I cut the cord about a year ago and I have a roku 3 that I also use. Only 2 complaints about the fire tv: 1) amazon pushes their services at you. If you can get past that, it's worth it. 2) the WiFi connection is not as strong as the roku 3. I've had to basically leave the fire tv upstairs (router is upstairs) and the roku downstairs. When I've tried to use the fire tv downstairs it buffers continuously. The roku has never buffered. I like both as both offer some channels not available on the other. I'll look into wifi-extenders so that I can use either throughout the house."
1,"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions."
1,This is the best device to stream to your tv with all the apps available. It costs more than the firetv stick but I recommend it because of the quicker processor and expandable memory.
1,"I'm a prime member and I bought 3 amazon Tv, if I have more rooms I would buy more"
1,Brought Alexa home turn her on and immediately she linked to all the smart devices inside my home. I think we were up and running in about 10 minutes. I couldn't be more pleased.
1,this kindle paperwhite new generation is really good.the display has been improved from the older version.its clear and easy to read than the older one.
1,Would recommend this to a friend. We are enjoying it a lot.
1,"other than not being voice activated like the Echo, it's just as good if not better"
1,The echo is really fun and can do so much. The family loves it
1,I like this Kindle Voyage. There is plenty of storage. The page turning is perfect.
1,i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime
1,My kids love them and they have yet to break them! Unlike some others I've tried that cost twice as much.
1,"I actually bought this one for a friend as I already have one. She reads all the time, and I told her this is what she needed. I'm not even sure she has taken advantage of all the other options that come with it but she loves it for reading her books. She is an older lady so I help set it up for her and have not had to help her do anything else. She has been able to navigate thru it with no other help. Greatest gift I could have given her."
1,My kids have owned the kindle fire for over 4 years. It was time for them to be more focused on reading and this is one of the best dreaded out there. Kids love the device and they can quickly borrow books from the city library.
1,This product is exceptional. It understands voice commands 99% of the time. It also improves over time with use.
1,Easy to use and very fun!! Use it for my PC speaker and it's awesome!!
1,One of the best invention ever! I love mine and giving as presents for Xmas!
1,"Cheap, I bought this for my son. If you can't afford an iPad, get this."
1,Awesome product. Got two of these for two kids! They really enjoy!
1,Awesome little device.. use it to control zwave lights with voice ... sometimes it has a hard time picking up my voice but other than that it is awesome
1,"Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books."
1,Wish Amazon didn't have the ad screen at start up. Makes it confusing for children.Price is great.
1,Had a good experience where I was would def go again
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is a great device for reading in all lighting conditions. The battery life is amazing, lasts for weeks without charge. It also syncs easily to your Amazon account. Some cons about the device is that it is a bit on the slow side when your shopping around for books on the device and I wish it came with a headphone jack for whispersync."
1,This is a good tablet for the price it does everything that i need to do except take pictures but that's not what i bought it for
0,The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's no iPad. It will be great for kids mostly. The screen quality is not the best.
1,"We bought this Kindle as a graduation gift for a relative and she loves it. It is easy to carry, fits in her purse and she has been able to easily load books on it! This was a perfect gift!"
1,"Bought this for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it and is constantly on it, mostly playing games."
1,"It's great to have a, ""know it all"" in the house now. I've been trying to stump her all day but she keeps giving me answers."
1,"Great to have, very friendly and easy to use, my daughter uses it to check her math problems, and any silly question she has Alexa has an answer..."
1,"Recently bought one of the 8GB models for myself and loved it. The next day, I ordered one for my wife and one for our kids. Easy to use, good battery life and a great price!"
1,Cheap item but works well. Gift for my dad amd he loves it.
1,"I bought this because I did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet. For $50, I really have no complaints. I am able to install thousands of apps, browse the web, watch movies and so much more for such a reasonable price."
1,I appreciate the ease of use and the flexibility of the FIRE. Also its portability.
1,"We use it so often - especially for music! We also use it for timers, controlling lights - we can't live without it!"
0,worth it to spend the extra 50 dollars and get the box w game control
1,Seriously awesome tablet for the price. Lots of additional apps to make this an awesome buy
1,Purchased for my son for Christmas and he loves it /. Great price
1,Great product works well especially enjoy the voice commands and the Ethernet cord works well. Love the apps and its very user friendly
1,The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
1,My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.
1,Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others
1,Great item to used. Can get alot of apps and games.
1,A great blessing for all sorts of information. 10 minutes to setup... unbelievable amount of information and assistance.
1,everyone needs a little black box. Fun and interesting
1,"Didn't know I would like it this much, but it's wonderful. I use it mostly for streaming music from Pandora. I love that I don't have to rely on another device and connect via bluetooth like other speakers and the sound it great!"
1,I bought this for my 7 year old son & he loves it!
1,Works well. Will recommend it to all my friends. Will buy it again
1,Love the unit. Great sound! Good general news available. Only thing negative is it has to remain plugged in to operate.
1,"I purchased one for each of my granddaughters. This tablet is taking longer to charge for some reason. Otherwise, great quality, runs smooth, and quickly."
1,Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.
1,Saw the TV commercials for this product and then bought it as a gift for a friend who likes technology.
1,was able to transfer all books over and like the size of the kindle
1,This is great for things like Pandora and playing music from your Amazon library by just asking Alexa. I also was able to get a thermostat that was compatible and can have Alexa change the temp by asking her to. Wemo devices are touch and go. Sometimes after a wemo firmware update they do not work. Also it could use a line out to hook up to a receiver like the dot does. Note it works with Spotify if you have a premium account only not the free one.
1,"Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free)."
1,I bought this to utilize playstaion vue to cut my cable. works great
1,Best bang for your buck............................
1,I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem!
0,Quality of screen display is lacking and the reason I returned the tablet. For adult users I cannot recommend.
0,Sad that I had to replace my original Kindle due to inability to recharge the unit. Now with this model the charge plug is a pain to use. Kindle please work on your designs.
0,Bought two of them first one would not charge after the first day. The second one The screen went blank so I have to return it now only after a couple of days of use. Will not purchase any more of this kind.
1,Awesome tablet with access to lots of apps. Great games and learning tools!
1,"I bought this tablet for my daughter to watch movies on & play educational games. It takes some time getting used to Amazon's Apps, But so far so good! It gets 4 stars bc the Camara takes terrible pictures."
1,Great tablet especially for the price it's not an iPad by any means but will run and play a lot of androids apps works off wifi and has a micro ad card reader
1,The Echo and Amazon Prime make for the perfect combo. Using this for parent in a rehab facility who can't see very well after a stroke. The voice commands work great only challenge is the connection to the facilities wifi. At home it would be no problem at all.
1,"I hesitated initially when purchasing this tablet, mostly because I have never had a tablet or e-reader and wasn't sure I could figure out how to use it. Even though this table comes with virtually no instructions, there is a lot of information online and it is very intuitive, even for a total novice. Now, just about a month since my purchase, I am loving this tablet so much and am so happy I purchased it. The price break made it an even sweeter purchase."
1,"I owned a Fire Stick previously, but when I bought a 4K TV, I wanted a media streamer that could playback 4K content. I tried the Roku but ultimately returned it for the Fire TV because it allows CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) over HDMI, which the Roku did not. For those who don't know, CEC (found in most new TV sets) allows your remote that comes with the TV to control other devices connected through an HDMI cable. Now I only need one remote for everything and didn't have to go out and purchase an expensive universal remote. The Fire TV was exactly what I needed for my 4K setup and now I use my Fire Stick for travel. Great product and great service from Best Buy."
1,This product is not just for reading books. It works just like a tablet.
1,"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
1,"I like the tablet, its fast enough for my daughter and would like it more without the ads or constant 'buy buy BUY!' taste I get while using it. Free underground apps are nice, my preference is plain jane android so I can control it. Do like the limit kids account I was able to setup so she doesnt change all the settings."
1,Purchased three tablets for my kids and I have not been disappointed. I am considering purchasing two more.
1,"We purchase this amazon fire TV for one of my TVS that is not smart and e are very happy with it, we used to watch Hulu, Amazon TV, it is very fast and we haven't had any problems."
1,"I bought this Fire for my son for primarily reading. Definitely not as good as the antiglare ones. If I were buying again for that purpose I would upgrade to the ones specifically for reading. As a tablet, it is a little difficult to navigate. It seems very cluttered. Does the job though."
1,I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ​is a very functional and easy to use.
1,Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
0,Decent little tablet at the price won't break the budget if broken.
1,Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
1,Work great with a 4K TV. Better quality than my other streaming devices
1,"Great starter tablet for a first time tablet owner. Bought this for my mom, and she loves it! Great for watching Netflix and surfing the web!"
1,Great tablet!!! works very good and fast. easy to get apps
1,I love it. So easy to set up. Works with all my Amazon apps like Audible. Learning something new about it every day. Especially like using it for music. Totally happy with the item and purchase!
1,"I'm not very familiar with tablets, so didn't know what to expect, but it does what I wanted it to do."
1,"Great buy. Wonderful product, was the Best Buy that I made"
1,"I seen the commercial and had to have it. My husband and kids got me this for mother's day, I'm so happy and love it."
1,Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
1,This product is great for the whole family and friends.
1,When I first purchased an Amazon fire TV box I was a bit skeptical to what I could get from it but being a member of Amazon prime I was quickly satisfied with all the content available so I decided to buy a second one for the bedroom.
1,I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.
1,I purchased this tablet as a gift for my 7 year old grandson. He is thoroughly enjoying watching his favorite YouTube videos and playing minecraft.
1,"Bought this as a gift. It was a great buy! Lightweight, great look, easy to use, great sound! I would highly recommend this product."
1,I loved how helpful the employee was that helped me!
1,This tablet is great not just for adults but also kids. After having this tablet I'll never go back to a different brand.
1,"Fire TV set up couldn't be easier, gives us access to all out favortie streaming services plus additional apps"
1,I bought this tablet for my son for Christmas. I chose this one because it was the most popular tablet sold. He hasn't parted with it yet.
1,"A nice high quality tablet with a fast processor. Superb image quality, long battery life, and a great value. Equal quality and performance of an IPad at a fraction of the cost."
1,"The Echo is truly amazing. Want the weather forecast, the time, listen to music, set a cooking timer? Alexa does it all for you. It does many things - you just have to explore on line to fully utilize the Echo. I'm sure that 10 years from now every home will have an Echo!"
1,This is my second kindle fire I love the ease of use with the fire and all my books
1,Pretty basic tablet that suits me since im not really looking for something to do with it other than play or browse the internet
1,This is my second Kindle. I love the smaller size. Much easier to navigate than the first one.
1,"Very good of a steal almost 50% off, not the best tablet but good for the price"
1,Amazon echo does so much and fun to use..I would definitely recommend this item
1,This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!
1,I love this .. Great extra for my amazon echo .. Does everything it does but it's cordless .. Keeps charge for many days .. Push button to activate .. Wireless speaker also out of wifi .. Really cool !!
1,Best thing that I purchased in a while. I love it.
1,Enjoy playing games and checking email and face book on this. Still learning everything it can do.
1,This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is.
1,Nice beginner tablet for the younger person. Perfect size for travel
1,Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far
1,It's fun getting to know all of the things this is capable of doing.
1,"These are great. This is my second Paperwhite and second charger. Thinking about a third, fourth...because while putting fiction on one and non-fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a Kindle dedicated just to recipes, another to health books etc would be marvelous"
1,Bought for my children for Christmas and it's great. The Free Time children's app is perfect for keeping my kids away from inappropriate sites. Don't like the screen savers are always ads.
1,"Love how this works, 5 year old gets around great on her own"
1,Bought this for a 5 year old and a 1 year old for they birthday. They love to play on it!
1,I was able to catch this thing on sale Black Friday for $70. It could possible be the best $70 I have ever spent. Everyone should own a amazon fire tv!
1,"Exelente streaming box, ultra fast and no buffering!"
1,Bought this for my mother in law for her birthday. Loaded it with books and music and made her the happiest lady in town. Works great as a reader and also for music when paired with a good set of blue tooth headphones.
1,LOVE THIS! excellent product and sound quality. liked it so much bought another one for my son as a gift.
1,I bought this for my sister last year and I had to buy for myself this year
1,"My kids love it. I think I will buy another one for myself. Holds a good charge, loud and pretty durable to be inexpensive."
0,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
1,This tablet comes with a camera and takes good pictures. It's light in weight which makes it great for reading. This tablet is fast.
1,Great customer service. Very fast and accurate. I appreciate all the help.
1,"The speed the great. The Kindle Fire has a lot of apps to choose from and has not frozed on me yet. Once you figure out the Parental Control, it works great with unwanted charges."
1,Was a great Christmas present for my grand daughter she loved it
1,"Bought for grandson ,he loves it's! He uses it daily after home work done."
1,The echo allows everyone in my house to add to my shopping list... love it.
1,Alexa is cool and can actually understand what I say and ask. Which was one of my worries. For everything Alexa can do I feel like I got a good deal.
1,I love my new fire tablet. It ls light and very easy to carry. I take it with me often. I have movies and music on it and it is great.
1,So far this has been a great product for us. We've been able to cancel our uverse and still watch al of our favorite shows.
1,This is a good product that has great sound and is fun to have around the house. Wish the product worked more with some of the apps on my phone like Napster.
1,amazon keeps adding more feature - it willl be light years ahead of google home when it comes out
1,"As promised, thank you very much!"
1,"Bought to use with PS Vue, no issues so far. Would be nice to be able turn it off when not streaming."
1,This was purchased to start the journey of ridding myself of ridiculous cable bills.
1,Excellent because use with my account prime and recomend
1,Good product.........................................................
1,This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
1,I would recommend everyone to get this item. You do have to purchase prime for $99 for the year but it will eliminate your cable bill because you have plenty to choose from to watch.
1,"Purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. Perfect size. The front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added FB, sharing photos was easy. Amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of Kindle books. There are Amazon ads on the Kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device."
1,This product is great. I bought it because it was cheaper than paying a cable bill.
1,"Cliche Alert: I never do product reviews. Let me tell you, I'm a Apple fanboy, and I'am angry that I purchased the new Apple TV before the Amazon Fire TV."
1,Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter! She was wearing my Kindle out with ABCmouse.com! She loves it and I love the warranty
1,"Got this for my granddaughter. It is perfect for her she listens to her music, makes videos for you tube and plays games! I actually am going to get one for myself~"
1,"This was perfect for entertaining my 20-month old great grandson during car trips, shopping and bedtime."
1,"Purchased as a gift for the mother-in-law who needed a new device for reading books. Even at the suggested retail it's a rather remarkable bargain; with Black Friday pricing it was a steal. Excellent graphics, convenient size."
1,Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.
1,"picked up a tablet because my laptop is over 3 years old, does a good job, sound levels are good, nice picture for a non hd product. Lots of pre installed apps and the ads on the sleep screen are annoying but for around 50 bucks not a bad product."
1,"We love the fire TV stick, got one for each TV and got rid of cable. Subscribed to PlayStation Vue instead. However we had to get a new Blackhawk router because we were constantly streaming, before that the TV was buffering tons. Works great now."
1,"There is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. It is not up to par with Apple pads and the high end Samsung pads. Check out the Amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. The screen is adequate, not HD, and outside/full sun hard to read. The operating system is Amazon's version of Android. Audio is adequate. WiFi and Bluetooth work well."
1,"Well, it happened. I became a huge fan of e-books, preferring them over an actual, physical book! This old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage NEVER EVER thought that would happen; then came the Kindle Paperwhite. I think I have read close to 10 books this past month because of the Paperwhite! I can make the font larger (which is great for my old eyes), and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical LCD screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. Because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. Also, the battery lasts a very long time; I usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. And an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the Paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distraction/temptation to surf the web instead of read. When you open it up, you are committed to reading. It is sooooo much better than my Nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.It is among the best purchases I have ever made!"
1,"Got two for my kids for Christmas they have been great so far they hold a charge and there not slow. I bought two off brand tablets last year of lesser quality and they didn't last very long, These have been worth every penny. The only negative is that you will have to eventually expand the memory"
1,"I returned the item for the Echo Dot, and purchased a separate bluetooth speaker. This provides more flexibility from my perspective. I have 2 Echo Dots and both are excellent,"
0,Great for streaming movies to your television. ...
1,"table is great, works good have had no problems with it and would recommend to a friend"
1,"While I will usually charge my kindle via my computer's USB ports, I will be able to recharge the device on occasions when I am away from my computer."
1,"For starters i had the Amazon stick for a while & got tired of that due to all the buffering issues, but what can you expect out of that little stick? so when this went on sale, i decided to upgrade & i'am so happy i did, it works great & has reduced the buffering to a minimum, but like anything online depends on the site your on. Love the fact you can speak into the remote and pull up the site you want."
1,This is a decent tablet for the money. Pleased with purchase.
1,I brought 3 tablet for my grandkids and the love them. Its easy to operate and block off other web sites to make it kid friendly
1,My children just loves this tablet. It's easy to use and a perfect size for them.
1,this thing will do anything... Will def by more and recommend it
1,I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it and now thinks its great since she has her own computer she says.
1,This kindle is a great product and very useful. It was reasonably priced.
1,My daughter loves this tablet. We purchased it for her for Christmas. I found a great bumper case on Amazon and very cheap. This was an awesome deal!
1,"Purchased a total of 3, one for each of my grandsons and one for me. Love reading on this kindle. One of my grandsons got a PS4 and he plays with his Fire rather than the PS4!"
1,I love my Amazon echo. Amazon is always updating the software so Alexa is always learning new things that can be useful on a daily basis.
1,"The Fire tablet is great, especially for the price! And if you are an Amazon Prime member, it's even better. You can read books for free using Amazon's Lending Library and watch Prime videos for free too. You can even get Google Play Store and download apps (just Google it) on the Fire. Make sure you get a micro SD card right away, because the 8GB internal storage fills up very quickly."
1,Great e reader. Preffered the brighter display of the voyage over the paperwhite. Happy with 3G connection for all time access.
1,"The best product name on the market,no doubt about it."
1,"This reader is much more comfortable to hold than the Paperwhite. It is not quite as light as the Nook Glowlight, but the screen is much sharper."
1,"Really like it.took a while to get familiar with it,after using the Kindle keyboard unit.works beautifully and has lot of new features on it that I really like."
1,This is my very first kindle. I am enjoying reading more books. The size is quite comfortable as well as the weight. The battery life is quite good. If you're looking for a new way to read book this is definitely the one.
1,Is good alexa. I recomed all people buy. Sound good
1,This was a gift for my son he enjoys it very much.
0,I bought this tablet as Bestbuy was closing them out. I find the screen is okay but not iPad quality. The speed is fine for my intended use but I would not be happy if I needed to use as my primary tablet.The operating system is lower then the current android build and I have not found a upgrade path.
1,"I can finally read late at night, and I can adjust the brightness so it doesn't disrupt my sleep!"
1,What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software.
1,Bought it for my 8 year old and she loves it. Very user friendly and has great parental controls/options.
1,IN LOVE WITH THE FIRESTICK. SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE WAS NOT BAD FOR WHAT IS OFFERS.
1,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Only downfall is you must purchase prime to get really any music.
1,"This tablet was bought to replace my Kindle Fire that had lost its video. I haven't used it a lot yet, but what I've done seems to work good. 8gb of internal storage and up to 128gb additional with a sd card gives you plenty of room for pictures,games, ebooks or videos. I will probably rate it higher once I've used it more."
1,Great assistant but does not know it all. Certain things you ask gets no response.
1,"Pick the fire tv over the Apple and we are glad we did. We didn't even realize how many free apps and shows you can watch without being a prime member. Great buy, I wish we had bought one a lot sooner and dropped cable."
1,This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality
1,"I replaced this with a fire stick hoping it would be faster, and it definitely is. It keeps apps opened to where you last left them, no more loading the app every time you turn on your tv. Well worth the extra $55."
1,I am satisfied with the Kindle Fire but would have liked a bigger screen model. Good for playing games.
1,This speaker is great for the price. I love how the speaker is 360 degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room.
1,This is a very nice small and an inexpensive tablet.
1,I really like them because I can get on my computer
1,Our new favorite toy. We love playing music through her.
0,"It did some things really well, like setting alarms and playing music, but there were too many times I would ask Alexa a question and she would respond saying she didn't know. I ended up returning it. Great promise, I just don't know that it is there yet."
1,"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
0,Many great features but the speaker does not meet expectations. I also have a google home. I ended up putting the google home in the living room because the sound was Better and put the Echo in the bedroom. I would also think it would be nice to have a plug to attach a speaker. You can use blue tooth but if your going to use a dedicated speaker to improve sound it would be nice to have the option.
1,"Bought my wife one 2 years ago, she loves it. Picked up 2 Moore for Christmas gifts. Great price."
1,"Purchased the amazon fire to gain access to streaming such as amazon prime video. The device was simple to setup and is nice and sleek. I have had the device for about a month now and have had zero issues with it. Also, i purchased this at bestbuy and about a week later it went on sale at amazon. Bestbuy priced matched the sale price and credited my card. Good customer service."
1,I bought this tablet as a gift for my 8 year old daughter. She loves it and it's easy for her to use. We downloaded multiple games on it for her.
1,"This is an excellent device for streaming video. The only downfall, it's only wireless so you need a good wireless connection. Other than that, it's totally awesome. I would buy again."
1,"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
1,"Bought for my nieces, great for them and easy to learn to use"
1,Replaced my Kindle with this; it was a great deal for the price
0,HAD THE AMAZON FIRE TV BOX FOX 1 WEEK AND IT BROKE
1,This is a great tablet for the price! Love the pink color!
1,"It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level."
1,works as expected. great Christmas present for the kids.
1,Preferred my old style and size because the new style did not fit withyour old case that was new
1,"Good addition to home automation, get amazon music."
1,This is a great starters tablet. Easy to use and compact.
1,"Great addition to making the home ""smart"" keeps getting better and better so far"
1,"I bought the table as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old. Perfect for children or beginners. Decent speed, only complaint is the camera (very bad quality camera)"
1,"I purchased this to read books online and also to check out from my local library. It takes a little getting used to because I also have an older IPad, but the more I use it, it seems pretty easy."
1,Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.
1,"I love this device, not sure how I have survived for so long without it. This thing does it all. I would recommend this product for sure. The sound is great coming out of this device."
1,Good value!
1,Follow the instruction on youtube and you can jailbreak this item to get access to movies still in theaters.
1,This is my second fire tv. It is a solid device with user friendly interface and remote. I would recommend over Roku and AppleTV.
1,"Had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. Liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! Still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.Paper white is nice reading."
1,"The setup was super easy, the rugged case is awesome, and the selection of books, games, and movies v for the kids is fantastic! The two year no questions warranty makes it even better!"
1,"Easy inexpensive gift that you can rely on. Although i would rather have the Google play store as the main download application, it's Worth the money to buy for others."
1,Bought for my granddaughter.. She love it..got a great warrant also
1,This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
0,"Thos works great for surfing the web and playing games, lite and compact"
1,"this product is very convenient for reading electronic books. and the price is nice. all in all, a good product."
1,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
1,"The one button system, and touch screen gives me some problems. but I am learning."
1,The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent product. It has so many capabilities that I can never use them all. Connects both wired and wi-fi. I have Amazon Prime and get more free stuff that really expands the experience.If you have kids they can take the use to a whole new level.
1,Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.
1,The speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable. I can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in.
1,I had no trouble registering this Kindle Fire. I have a plane Kindle & I like the Fire a lot better. It is user friendly even for first time user.
1,"This remote is especially good for those who eyesight is weaker, due to aging. I got it as a gift for someone, and it makes searching for channels easier for the elderly."
1,"I have two boys, 5 and 7, they empty the tablet's battery everyday playing, still working perfect.And parental control is very good."
0,"Not many negative things to say. It's solid, and comes with a lot of preloaded content. Sign in with your Amazon account email and you're set. Use a USB dongle and wireless keyboard to really streamline your input, in case the voice command leaves you frustrated."
1,"Bought this at Best Buy only because Amazon was out of stock. Does 4k video, tons of apps that support it. Just make sure that your cable company is on the list of providers for standalone apps, e.g. HBO Go, Discovery, History, Travel Channel etc, else you'll find yourself not able to watch their specific content on this box. Bought it mainly because I use Playstation Vue to stream content and hate the tile setup on Roku. PS Vue on the Fire TV is a timeline setup, I prefer this much more than the Roku setup. Great box, works flawlessly with Alexa and Prime memberships. IMO, worth the $90, plus I got a free 30 day trial of Sling. Although I think the Sling trial is a con more than a pro hahaha!"
0,"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
1,I love the parental controls. The tablet has been great.
0,"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79"
1,love the improvements they made on this fire kindle.
1,I Love it...!!... It's so compact and lightweight.
1,The Amazon Firestick with voice remote is very easy to set up and very easy to use. The voice remote makes finding what you want to watch very easy.
1,"My wife wanted a backlight with her kindle, in addition to other features! Even if not on sale, this is a great buy for anyone who enjoys reading!"
1,This thing is much better than the fire stick version it's much more powerful and faster and the best part is you can connect it to the internet via ETHERNET CABLE.
0,"The white echo is nice-looking and subtle on the countertop. The sound quality is the best feature. Basic voice commands are best: is it raining?, other commands need effort: what are cumulus clouds? 'Sorry I don't know that'."
1,This is a great tool. We use as alarm and Bluetooth all the time.
1,I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet.
1,Great tablet and very cheap. Used to for gift for customers and ita amazing
1,I love this best gadget I have bought in a long time
0,"The fire has a solid build, is not horribly slow, and has decent battery. Its major flaw today is the screen, which is both low resolution and poor contrast, with weak viewing angles. It makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though. For the price, not bad."
1,Surprised now much we use our Echo everyday. Do yourself a favor also get a Bluetooth speaker and the Echo remote
1,"I love the ability of my fire to hold ebooks or audio books as well as being able to go online, check email, take and post pictures and updates. I can even play a game while listening to an audio book."
1,"I buy these often for trade show booth prizes. The customers are always excited about them, and they make great gifts!"
1,This little tablet is great for so many things. Can't believe the quality I got for the price I paid.
1,"I wanted to avoid the excessive blue light created by I-Pads, phones, and other color electronic devices. This lets me read right up till bedtime with no problems."
1,If your have the white plug it'll work
1,The screen is very sharp and easy to use. The letters are crisp and distinctive. The back light works well in the dark or light. I have no problem reading at night in the dark or during the day outside in direct sunlight. The new page press buttons are perfectly placed and very convenient. It's light weight and small enough to hold in one hand whole reading. I only have to charge it every 2 weeks.I would recommend this edition to anyone who enjoys reading.
1,"The price was right on this for my 10 year old, works great and easy to use. Nice parental features also"
1,Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with
1,bought for a birthday gift my daughter loves it. the clarity and the dictionary and vocabulary builder are great tools she says
1,"Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need."
1,This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
1,"Tablet is nice, screen is very clear. However, too many ads pop up during use, no way to disable them. Very frustrating when using. If that were corrected I would better be able to recommend this item."
1,It is a very nice reading source. I bought it for my wife. She had the original Kindle and liked it but the back lighting makes all the difference. Nice size and good battery life.
1,"Good tablet fir children 3 and up , especially when you go on a vacation, long plane or train ride ."
1,Foe the Price... Its a steal. Awesome tablet for basic needs.
0,You can't go wrong for $50.00 The only thing is that the graphics and speed aren't the best.
1,It's been prefect for my daughter to use for Netflix!
1,This is my second Kindle. My first was the basic model. This one is so clear and easy to read even in daylight. I love that I no longer need a light to read at night in bed.
1,We bought them for our kids but they are good enough for us to play too
1,We was looking for a easy tablet that has all the great features and functions that a young child can learn and grow with. I will be a great Christmas present.
1,We needed a new tablet and after some research this one seemed to fit our needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a tablet.
1,This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..
1,My family love the amazon echo ! We use it all the time. The kids love to hear her tell jokes. Can't wait to add another one to have in another part of our house.
1,I got this unit to stream Netflix and to watch YouTube contents. It works fast and like the fact that it has a Ethernet port.
1,"Easy to take on trips, hospital or beach. Clear and sharp display. I like that I can add extra space with a stick. The price was right too. I would recommend highly."
1,"It's a great product, but giving the price, you can find the same thing in the form of a cheap tablet that does more. Still a solid product tho"
1,What a terrific device. You can ask it anything and she has an answer. It's small enough to place anywhere so it doesn't look instructive
1,Starting with the issue. This is the cheaper version because it had ads. If you want to remove the ads it will cost you $15. This might be stayed in the fine print but this is not mentioned or brought up by the salesman.
1,"After thoroughly researching I decided to give it a go and buy it. After some trouble with initial setup, it works great! I have 2 young boys and they have really had fun asking Alexa questions. I have linked to a smart outlet which is really nice for turning a lamp off and on. Overall I have really enjoyed, to the point I just got one of the Dots for another room in our house."
1,I was looking to buy a tablet mostly to connect to my speakers to play music. I found the perfect one for a great price. It has many capacities as well such as the camera. All the apps you could ever want are on this amazon tablet as well. I would recommend to anyone trying to buy a small tablet.
1,"love the big screen, clear pictures and fast loading. battery lasts long. I use it every day !"
1,The device is excellent and you program is easy and your price is very economic
1,Devise does what it's supposed to do very well. Easy on the eyes and battery life is awesome. Recommended
1,"Maybe 5 stars, but it still won't clean my house! But I'm still learning. Hooked up some light with wifi smart plugs,....love it!!!!!!!!"
1,"Working efficiently, no complaints so far. Makes reading fun!"
1,The Amazon fire is a great tablet. U cannot beat the price. Works as good as other way more expensive tablets
1,I love the fact it is a small unit takes up almost no space and has great features
1,I use this tablet just for entertainment purposes on all amazon apps
1,"Great gift for my Mother, she loves it. She plays Music to her grand baby's"
1,"Use this for my scripture study, It does what I need it to do plus."
0,"If you own a tablet or smartphone, you already have one. If you don't, one of your friends/family will give you one of their three spares. These adapters are ubiquitous.While they're not all exactly the same, they all do the same thing. Worth about 2."
1,It does so many Things. It is nice matching up with Echo Dot and using as Intercom.
1,Perfect product that met my needs and expectations.
1,Would recommend this to others better than kindle fires of best
1,"just got it for price, was replacement as gift. friend likes it"
1,We got each boy one and they love it. Easy for all ages :)
1,I like to watch movies on it. But it doesn't see to connect correctly to WiFi.
1,Love this Kindle -It's a great size for travel as I can read it or check my emails or play games.
1,My kids love these. I purchased 3 of them at one time. They seem really durable.
1,Got this for my Father but added a 32GB drive so he can have more storage. Love the idea that you can do that & wish Apple would do the same.
1,Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
1,Now that this supports hands free access and amazon has discontinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device.
1,This Amazon Fire TV is awesome! Way faster than the stick.
1,"As a regular Amazon Prime user that gets much of my staples through prime, Echo makes it that much easier."
1,"Works great and constantly updated and improving. I use it to turn on my lights, my fan and adjust my two thermostats. I also ask it to play my favorite talk radio and more. Will pick up more for other parts of the house."
1,"I bought this for my daughter for her 16th birthday and she likes it to ware her mind down at night. She made the comment that it great with the exception that its a bit slow, other than that it suits her needs."
1,"I had the opportunity to cut my cable, am having a wonderful experience"
1,"Perfect all around reader, great price and service"
1,This is a good tablet for my daughter. Does everything she needs it to do.
1,It works as advirtized and. Best Buy had it in stock at my nearest store
1,"It's get for my 6 and 4 year old boys, and they love them"
1,Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it's a grade little tablet!
1,Great tablet for the price. It is very clear to use and it responds well.
1,"I bought this electronic reader because I was tired of the glare I got from reading on my iPad in the sun. It's perfect! Very light and easy for travel, and the screen actually looks like the page of a book."
1,"Works great, good value. Only problem is display is not bright enough when outside."
1,Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!!
1,I gave this as a gift and the recipient has really enjoyed it. He said the sound was better than expected. The number of questions the Echo can answer is a little disappointing but everything else was as advertised.
1,My kids loved and i very happy for this tablet. Thanks
1,"I bought the Amazon Fire for my daughter for her 8th birthday. It was decently priced. I can set parental settings and a curfew. I have to confirm what she wants to download. She loves it and plays games, listens to music, and reads books on it."
1,Love this tablet easy to use. Wonderful color and compact enough to carry.
1,Very easy to use! Love that you could talk to it and take you where you want.
1,"We love this for checking the weather, music and alarms. Kinda pricey but I used my reward points to purchase."
1,"I find myself reading even more now that I have the Kindle Voyage. It is easy to hold and maneuver, the perfect size, small and sleek. Page turning is easy with one hand and the back light makes reading in any setting a pleasure."
1,I had an older Fire and I must say thus one is definitely an upgrade. Speed of browser and apps opening is faster. Color choices are nice !
1,Love being able to listen to radio stations or music
1,Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she's over the moon about it. She's already purchased dozens of books to read on it and carries it around wherever she goes. I'd say that's the sign of a great product.
1,great item works real good. awesome awesome awesome
1,"Great product, I have Apple TV 3, and this is just as good or better."
1,This is a great device for your transition off cable. I recommend slingtv to help the transition. I have the firetv as well as the firestick. Spend the additional money for better wifi. You can also wire direct for best HD streaming. Netflix and Prime work well over wifi with 20 Mbps type speed. I just upgraded to 100 Mbps for better results. Also see Kodi app.
1,"I had put off getting an echo and now, I am hooked on it. It was easy to set up and is extremely easy to use. In conjunction with a harmony remote control and hub, the echo controls the stereo, television and more. The fidelity is surprisingly good for a small unit."
0,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
1,This was on offer for thanksgiving. I just bought it just as a second tablet to iPad. have to say it is good. .
1,Definitely the best amazon streaming device!5 stars
1,"We wanted an additional easily portable tablet for our family. The omnipresent advertising is annoying but also easy to just ignore. For 50 bucks, this is a great way to have an additional e-reader/browser/streaming and gaming device."
1,I find reading books on this tablet to be better than expected despite the shiny glass display.
1,This is what i believe is the best purchase that i made. Android platform and loving it. Able to cut the cable and is dependent on Fire TV. Highly recommended.
1,"Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
1,This kindle is a great product. I really enjoy it.
1,"The Echo is pretty great, news in a snap, and music at your fingertips. Gets most voice prompts accurately, even when my kids are yelling different things at her at the same time! And she never loses her temper..."
1,Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again.
1,works great for my kindle paper white but the seond kindle that I ordered will cot turn on
1,"i enjoy reading in many different situations... that is on an airplane ,at the airport the beach, pool ,at home or in the dentist office and almost everywhere else i happen to be. this product is easy to use,easy to read and easy to carry with me."
0,My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.
1,"Purchased this for my grandson. He loves it, especially the front/rear camera."
1,Very handy. No more need to buy books. Keep this next to your bed.
1,I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
1,My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
1,"Was a Christmas gift for my daughter in college, so she hasn't used it much yet. But seems like it should be good for her."
1,Pretty happy with the Fire over the Firestick. Really enjoying the 4K streams.
1,I am very pleased with this product. Amazon is definitely the best out there.
0,"The sales rep told me this kindle Fire tablet is easy to set up. Just follow the directions. Three hours later + a trip back to the store, a member of the Geek Squad finally got my e mail to work. He could not tell me why it was a problem. Also the camera quality is very poor. If you use it to check your e mails and browse the web, its fine. Other than that.... oh well."
1,Amazon TV is a great streaming devise and it has voice control.The Fire TV also streams in 4k
1,We received this as a gift and questioned its usefulness. After setup we feel in love with it. It is both fun and useful.
1,have set it up to control various devices and can easily be used by 80 year old uncle
1,I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
1,"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
1,"After trying Apple TV, I'm happy with Amazon fire. The remote is great and easy set up"
1,"Its good for what my son wanted it for,, games and books. Good price also"
1,Bought for my kids. They each have one and love them.
1,This Amazon Fire TV controller was a cinch to sync up with my TV. Kids love to use it to play games. I love it to surf around all the available content. Get this controller!!
1,i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
1,For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
1,We are more than satisfied with this tablet along with the price!
0,"I mean... it work fine, but 20 fine There's nothing special here and it's a joke that Amazon doesn't just ship a charging plug with the Kindle in the first place. You should be able to find plenty of non-OEM chargers that'll work in terms of watts and voltage for far less money, like 5."
0,I really just needed a cheap Christmas gift for one of my god children ..
