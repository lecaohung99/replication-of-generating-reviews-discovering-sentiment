1,"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy."
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it definitely worth it
1,Bought this Kindle for our grandchild and he loves it.For anyone who just loves to read this size and weight is perfect!!!!
1,So fun and useful. We play with it and rely several task with it.
1,"Great for streaming, TV shows! Highly recommend this product!"
1,"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!"
1,The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
1,"Great tablet for price. Highly recommended, quick and easy to use."
1,This is a great product but I wish we could get local tv
1,"This tablet is great for beginners like myself, I haven't done much more than check emails and read articles but there is more to learn and do"
0,Really expected a chord with it for the price we paid. Very dissapointed.
1,"Excellent Black Friday deal. My 17 year old son was very excited to go to Black Friday, so after Thanksgiving dinner we walked down to Best Buy and were so surprised to find it busy, but organized and easy to see items and find great deals!"
1,I purchased this tablet for my mother as a christmas present. She is not tech savy to say the least. Once she got it set up she has fallen in love with. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone
1,"Great device for the price, got it in a reasonable amount of time."
1,Echo is a great product. Wish it had better understanding i find myself having to repeat often but other than that i love it great product
1,Right price my son loves it great for games and you tube
1,Bought 3 for kids... they stay charged through play all day (7-9 hrs) and have been dropped and slammed a few times already but still look perfect and work just like new

1,Great for reading books.Screen easy to read with no glare.
1,I'm glad we purchased the TV. We have both and the streaming is better on the TV. Now to upgrade to 4K
1,"I bought this for my wife and she can't put it down. Ordering books at your fingertips, and it holds a charge for a very long time. You can use it anywhere, in any lighting."
1,"As one step in setting up our new home we wanted an easy formate for news, music and communication. Echo provides all of that and more."
1,This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
1,Wow what doesn't this do. Enjoy listening and finding out what it can do.
1,my 8 year old son has a new found passion for reading now that he is using this kindle.
1,My wife loves it better than the samsung galaxy tab 2 that she origanally used.
1,"The colors and surfing is just great, size and connectively is great. Children love it. Makes reading anywhere a breeze."
1,Very easy to set up. Just plug in and ask her questions. Haven't used parental controls so can't say anything about that.
1,"I like the small size and auto adjustable lighted screen. With my old Kindle I needed to have external light to read, but this one comes with the build one."
1,I got the Amazon Fire 7Tablet for my daughter as a Christmas present and she loves it. It meets all her needs.
1,I bought this for my 10 year old grandson and it was easy for him to learn and became his favorite Christmas present.
1,Bought this for someone special. Has not been operated much yet.
1,Great starter Kindle for the kids. They enjoy the ability to surf.
1,For what it does it's great for me a good alternative
1,"My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes."
1,She's super awesome!! Definitely recommend! She helps me remember to do lists and she plays awesome music with Amazon prime
1,Has some good apps and performance is good for the specs.
1,I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
1,This is a great device for leisure entertainment. I really enjoy the games and applications that allow me to surf the web.
1,Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
1,AFTER 3 YEARS WITH A SMALLER AMAZON FIRE THIS ITEM IS A GREAT RELACEMENT. VERY SLEEK DESIGN. OVERALL EASE TO UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL SOFTWARE WAS NICE . VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT
1,Much easier to use than the stick.i would recommend .
1,Love it! Alexa is Amazing! It is user friendly without touching the speaker.
1,The device is amazing the kids love it. It's very easy to use almost like a iPad.
1,"I love to read but books were beginning to take over my space! This little ""baby"" is so small and holds a lot of books. Not only that, I can upload a new book any time I want to without leaving my house!"
1,"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load"
1,My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
1,"good value for the money, love the kindle for reading"
1,it works great. the resolution is excellent. the streaming is great. loving it so far. just a bit pricy
1,"This is just the right size and price for my kids. For just playing the games, watching netflix, or just cruising the net, this is a great value."
1,I LOVE HOW IT PAYS NO PAUSE MOVIES AND AUDIO LOUD I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS FOR A FRIEND
1,Easy to set. Easy to use. So glad I upgraded my Fire Stick to the Fire Tv box.
1,Love the speed and the quality of this product. Watch all my shows in great definition.
1,Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!
1,"I bought this as a gift, and we all tried it out. Setup was pretty easy - download the app, connect it to your wi-fi, and you're off and running from there. Some of the potentially useful things that we saw right off the bat were:* Reading your news headlines in the morning* It feels like a voice-oriented Google search* Getting answers to random questions* Kids are easily entertained by itPersonally, I don't see the need for it - but I can appreciate the convenience and novelty of it."
1,"I like how the Amazon Fire TV works consistently. With it being able to be hardwired into my existing network, it fires up and works seamlessly."
1,Great product at a great price. Gave out as Safety recognition gifts.
1,"My kids love it and use it for everything, including their homework. It is really a great companion."
1,Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.
1,Love it. Got it for my grandson. Since i have amazon prime. He can watch alot of free movies and games
1,Amazing for reading kindle which was my main concern. The cameras are not that amazing & downloding is pretty quick the battery evens last long great quality for its price great gift idea
1,This amazon fire 7 tablet is good for web surfing.not so fast but its ok.
1,"When Amazon first released this, I couldn't rationalize spending the money to purchase something that could play music, answer questions, report traffic and weather, etc. I did a lot of research before looking into purchasing one because I wanted to start converting my home into a Smart Home. I purchased this along with the Philips Hue and so far, I haven't regretted the purchase. Using the Apps to control the lighting is great but when you can simply use voice commands, it makes it that much more convenient. I would recommend this or any of the other ""echo"" products if you're looking to convert to a Smart Home."
1,Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there 70s
1,I really like this tablet. Its fast and responsive and just the right size.
1,I have been enjoying using my Amazon Echo. It is very satisfying.
1,"I already had two DOTS (one connected to my main stereo via the aux line), but I wanted a stand alone Alexa device for a large bathroom suite. No real complaints other than value. I think this should be more like a $129-139 device. The speaker quality is pretty good but I expected something closer to a high end stand alone bluetooth speaker for $179. Still, I don't regret the purchase and I would make it again. One other factor that didn't affect the way I am using it....unlike the DOTS...the ECHO cannot be used with earbuds because it does not have bluethooth sending capabilities."
1,Numerous charges of iPhone 6 at 20 degrees or less and still had 3 bars remaining
1,Got this for my kids. It does everything they want it to. Great price for what you get. Highly recomend for someone wanting a good tablet that won't break the bank.
1,it's very useful and comfortable! I like it so much.
1,great tablet.just needs a way to disable ads and stuff like that..if you play alot of games you should get the 16gb one.
1,So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips
1,"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
1,I would recommend this tablet to anyone that is interested in one. It is just as good as a Samsung one and half the price.
1,Bought this box and love it. Cut cable and use this with PlayStation Vue. I recommend this over Roku
1,More interaction is needed between other devices. Too hard to remember opening statements to get echo to respond.
1,This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
1,"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this."
1,The Kindle Fire is a good tablet! It is easy to navigate!
1,Bought this as a gift for my 5 year old nephew. It is easy for him to use. Downloaded educational games for him to play. Great buy!
1,"good,like the larger size screen and able to increase font for easy reading"
1,"This is my 2nd FireTV I now own, and love them both. Setup was a snap even without it preconfigured from Amazon."
1,"I use this hours a day. Whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a wemo-device, the battery life, sound quality, and voice recognition is great."
1,"There are so many advantages to the Fire TV box. It has an Ethernet connection and a USB port. Add a wireless keyboard or flash drive. It's got 4K and it is fast. The fire stick is more reasonable priced but it's not as fast and doesn't have any USB or Ethernet connection. If you have a few bucks more, go for the Fire TV box."
1,Don't care for the ads on this. But for the price its good. Ads can be removed for 15 bucks through Amazon.
1,"The paper white does what it claims it will do.You can go for weeks on end w/ only a single charge and it still have juice. Reading and import documents such as per files are simple via ""drag-n-drop"" in the root folder (which you'll create), documents. I only which that the ability to read .doc .docx files were available rather than having to convert files to pdf format. The screen is gentle to the eyes to read, whether outside in the sun or a low light setting, backlight or not."
1,Bought this to replace my old kindl its a bit smaller also easyer to handle
1,Got for reading Amazon books. Works great. Would recommend.
1,"Never loved or hated one of these before but, it's great cause it works"
1,All my friends and some family members have and I wantedto join in on the fun of Alexa! The speaker sounds great when playing music. Have linked my lights as well. Lovin my gal Alexa!
1,Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - White works great my wife has had the this item for a year and is still going strong. Great way to read books.
1,Amazon - Fire Tv is ok. i was thinking it was going to be faster then the Amazon stick.
1,"Reading on my commute, or in a waiting room, is a pleasant way to pass time - and convenient"
1,"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
1,I really like it it's going to very nice sound to it but it's a little bit slower than my echo.for some reason but other than that I really like it
1,"I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc."
0,Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...
1,I bought this for my husband for Christmas since our daughter uses the other tablet all the time. He has barely put it down since he opened it!! He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.
1,Bought this product for grand child and he really likes it. Kept him busy on long trip.
0,"Just got this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't stand.. Nothing to secure it to make it stand.. You can get it to stand maybe to watch a video, but don't touch it. It will fall down easily. Certainly don't stand it and actually use your Fire HD6 with this cover.. You can't.. Falls right over. I feel really badly for the special person that bought me this. Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around."
1,"I have the Fire Stick and it did not support 4K, so I purchased the Fire TV with my new 4K TV and this unit performs better than my Fire Stick. There is not much waiting between clicks and it supports 4K!"
1,"Bought the original Kindle Fire, and was impressed with the latest updated version. Better software, camera, and more apps make this all the more worth the small price. I guess that Amazon takes a loss on the production of this unit to gain your interest in buying their merchandise and using their services. In any case, it works, and I would recommend this to anyone interested in an inexpensive internet access device."
1,I enjoy the convenience of the size and the ease of reading with this reader.
1,"I love having music playing constantly. I bought the echo for the dining room and the dot for my master bath! ! Love love love them. Also i haven't made a shopping list since I've had them and haven't forgotten random ""stuff"" i need."
1,"Got this on sale and it's very good, the interface is easy to use and super easy to set up"
1,I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease. It is a great tool for her in school work since there are numerous apps. she is able to use for multiplication and division facts. A great product!
1,Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
1,"The product is as advertised. I have good internet and it works great. Was able to ""cut the cord"" and save a good bit of money."
1,"I was so pleased with my Amazon TV Stick on my guest room TV, that I purchased the Amazon TV for my other TV. Awesome!! Awesome!! With those and the Google ChromeCast, I have the world of entertainment at my finger tips."
1,"Perfect gift for my dad, he loves to read. He is in love with Kindle."
1,I need more learning but I'm coming along.Sirii is better. Music is great on the echo.
1,This probably the most amazing electronic device I have in the home. Only thing that would make it better was if I could connect it to sound bar for a little better sound but this thing will answer almost anything. Well worth the money. Everyone should have at least one - we have 2 now and will buy more.
0,I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound
1,"Friendly user systen, easy to setup, good size to put in a bag"
1,Much better than it he earlier Kindles no more messing with lights
1,Item is a replacement for one that was starting to go back. It works fine.
1,"I previously had a standard Kindle...the battery would no longer hold the charge. I wanted to replace it but be able to read in dim light. This feature is great. I chose the paperwhite because the screen did not glare like the Fire. It took some getting used to since it is all touch screen, but it has a few better features than the original. One complaint is that it sometime jumps further ahead than one page, so you need to pay attention when moving to the next page. I recommend it for someone who wants to use it for reading only."
1,"We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it."
1,My daughter absolutely love her tablet and I love it to for her. It's very kids friendly
1,"Very cool product. Easy setup and very easy to use. Setup was fast, especially if you already have a Amazon account."
1,"I got this because I saw it on Amazon.com. I the. Went to BB just to see if they had it in stock. I fooled with the demo for about a minute and decided it was good enough to spend the $50 on. If I didn't want it I could give it to my mom or something. This thing has really impressed me. I have an iPad and an iPhone 6s. The kindle isn't near the performance of those guys but I was looking to step outside my ecosystem and just get a feel for something new. Besides, Amazon can do no wrong. Bottom line is that it's a greater starter tablet...something to have on the nightstand and let the company use."
1,"I bought this tablet for my children, I love it for its parental control settings as well as how fast it is. The volume is louder than many other tablets I have handled, which makes it great for watching videos or game play. I would definitely recommend this product and would purchase it again"
1,"This is the best tablet in it's category at a price point which everyone can afford. Big thanks to Amazon for making this possible. The user experience is very good and there are enough number of apps to play around including the must haves like Facebook,Youtube ,Netflix etc."
1,This kindle is by far the best one I've had. I have zero complaints.
1,"It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet"
0,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.
1,Alexa will simplify your life. Give her a chance and you will be glad you did.
1,The kids love it and easy to understand. Great parental controls as well.
1,"The tablet is nice, it is good for the price, lot of apps available and easy to use"
1,"Can't beat the price these are going for, gets the job done."
0,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up."
1,My grandkids plays with this tablet all the time.lots of videos and games
1,This is a great device. Easy to install easy to use.
1,WHAT DID WE DO BEFORE ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY? I LOVE THE ECHO! THE SOUND AND FEATURES ARE AMAZING!
1,Great tablet for the money Would buy another Easy to use
1,I really wanted to buy this kindle paperwhite and I can't be happier. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting for a e-book reader. Really nice product really love it!
1,"Alexia - I love you!! Controls the lights, saves my shopping list, timer, plays music plus so much more..."
1,"We purchased the Amazon Echo as a family gift, it has had great reviews so far."
1,Sound production is outstanding!! Very easy to set up and use!
1,"This is so awesome, I can check my email when I'm not at home, if the place I'm visiting has WIFI. It also plays games! A true multi-tasker!"
1,I had to buy this item due to the store no longer having the Firestick in the store. Set up was easy and dry easy to use.
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift. My daughter loves it. She specifically likes the screen lighting.
1,Good quality tablet. This tablet could be a bit more user friendly but once u get going by pushing a view apps you can find most of what your looking for.
1,Just got my kindle and am just getting use to it. Like it so far.
1,"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
1,Bought this for my mom who is in her 70's. It's perfect and easy to use for the older generation.
1,"I had the paperwhite, but this voyage is definitely better. The quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience. Lighter than the paperwhite, love the pressure sensors to change pages. Overall better experience reading experience than the paperwhite."
1,Excellent product especially for price. Used by my younger daughter.
1,I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It was easy to set up and I have absolutely no complaints. I reviewed different e-readers and decided on the paperweight because I could read it outside with no issues. I have tested it in the bright sun light and had no problem with any glare. Even with the sun shining directly on it.
1,"What a GREAT PRICE!! This one is a lot different from the one I am replacing. I, personally, don't think it's as user friendly. But there's nothing that can be done about that. I only use it for books, nothing else."
1,"With Amazon Fire TV, you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. Find favorites quickly or access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search..."
0,I like the size of it and it's easy to operate. I didn't like that I had to keep trying to put the same information in more than once to more from one screen to another when putting in my card information. I need to have wifi to look at the stuff I downloaded and I don't like that. But for the cost it's ok.
1,It was very easy to download and read the books in the tablet
1,"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
1,a birthday gift for my son and he likes it. always attached to his hand and always on it.
1,"Use to do everyday questions. What's the time,weather,addtoo shop list, check calendar and all kinds of little things without having to open computer lying in bed."
1,Works great. Is a good upgrade for those who have a regular kindle. Terrific for low light reading.
1,"Very good quality price ratio!We buy this table for a little kid for a very low price and it's one of best deal for a very long time....Again, very good for their low price."
1,"Great and clear looking screen, with a 3d effect. Easy set up. Loving it!!"
0,"Unfortunately, Alexa is still complicated to get it to recognize smart devices."
1,"2nd one I've bought as a gift, can't go wrong! Will probably end up buying another!"
1,I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since
1,Like all amazon stuff i have used these things are great built insanly well and eith a reasonable price tag way better then any of the rokus i have tried.
0,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
1,"The sound is good, worth a try. The minus thing is they need to improve the voice recognize"
1,"Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way."
1,It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
1,"This Fire TV is perfect for my intended use, I have cut the cable with the big cable companies and plan to use this for a long time."
1,"This is lots of fun, you can ask it what to wear, play you a song, your calendar, all while you're doing other things. So there is no wasted time, however I am not sure of the Privacy part of it. I think it is always listening and we will start to get marketed due to what we talked about at the dinner table"
1,"The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple. I like the lighted screen and the page forward and back ""buttons"" on the sides of the device. But it is rather pricey - not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge."
1,I bought the Echo for my 30 year old daughter. She loves it. Very useful and works great. Easy to use.
1,This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
1,tablet was easy to set up and get started. 80 year old mother loves it!
1,If you have decided to buy a digital assistant this is the one to choose. Google home is good but not nearly as refined as Alexa. I have used both extensively and the Echo is the hands down winner.
1,"I needed something new for my bathroom, love to sing in the morning. Love to listen to the radio getting dressed, hear the morning news and traffic. Great for winding down in the evenin with some jazz in a bubble bath."
1,"I paid $35 for this unit right before Christmas. I have had an iPad mini2 for 3 years and this is not as user friendly, but for $35 now when traveling I have a 2nd streaming device. Perfect for kids/streaming."
1,"The general use for this tablet is only worth for Amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use Amazon products, I don't recommend this to anyone else. The tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price."
1,"Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the ""FIRE"""
0,"So I love my electronics. I have an Ipad but when I saw this on sale I got myself one just to have since I am a prime member I figured I could use this too. The only thing I like about this is that you an expand the the storage. If the Ipad had that option it would be amazing. So since I then expanded the memory I can have more movies to watch offline. Camera is horrible, So I would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad."
0,It was given to my friend as a gift. I hope he likes it.
1,very easy to use and the battery life is execellent
1,Great gift for the family and friends. I have purchased several.
1,My wife loves the tablet.it is light weight !!!!!!
1,It's voice activated capability is nice but not that responsive when the volume is full. You have to keep your voice loud so it can hear you.What is also nice is how it learns and can have multiple profile for family.
1,A great streaming device that I use on a daily basis.
1,"Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read."
1,My friend loves it. It's what he needs for his holiday.
1,Great and fun to use. I like the music link up and news
1,"This watch is not only very useful, it's very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the ""smartwatch"" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least."
1,"I like this product, still getting to learn how to use it."
1,Love the firestick. You don't need cable tv anymore.
1,"I love this device, I can just tell it what to do without having to push buttons on my phone."

0,Great tablet for a beginner to catch up on reading.
1,My grandson used my old I Phone to play on. Got him this tablet and he loves it! Great deal!
1,"I already have one of these that I had bought for Christmas. I bought this one for my grandmother because she loves to read just as much, if not more, than I do! She LOVES it! And the user interface is super easy to use so she has no trouble at all working it! She tells me all the time its the best gift she has ever gotten! If you are thinking about buying one DO IT! Its worth every penny and more!"
1,It works just fine.

1,"Great price for a good product. So far so good and no issues. Wish they had more apps, but great nonetheless. Great for gifts for family members."
1,"Very nice tablet for the price.. only problem, it sort of ""ties"" you up to be an amazon subscriber for a fee, so beware of this :)"
1,Very good quality
1,product is very intuitive and easy to use. works well with the phillips light system
1,"very easy to set-up. a big hit a parties, excellent speaker."
0,"At first, the fire box was great. After two months the remote stopped working. I'd say save some money and just get the fire sticks. I have two of them and no problem. The fire tv box has been nothing but issues."
1,My Son Loves His Tablet That Santa Got Him For Christmas
1,This Fire TV meets all requirements. I haven't turn on the Apple TV since I purchased this device.
1,A high quality and affordable new toy that anyone should have. Loved it!
1,"Can't wait to pair with smart items, a little large but ok"
1,The ECHO is really easy to set and use. I am surprised at the quality of sound.
1,I was needing an additional streaming device for Spotify. This handles exactly what I need.
1,You can't beat a color HD tablet for $50. Go buy one now!
1,"Aside from being about the only eink readers still available, the Amazon Kindle series of readers offer bang for the buck, and features that you don't know you need. The Paperwhite reader is great in sunlight, in a lit room, or even in a darkened room. The available Kindle books offer a tremendous variety of genres and titles for a low cost. And with shareware converters like calibre, classics available through public domain are all there to be read. If you love books, then this is for you."
1,"I liked Amazon Fire TV, it's powerful and the result is amazing."
1,I like it so much as it comes with Alexa with new OS. You can download all the cool apps that u need. Worth the money we spend.

1,Good reads with my new paperwhite kindle. made my reading experience great.
1,Great product kindle fire got one for mom and dad for Christmas presents nice to add storage

1,My daughter loves her PaperWhite. I like that it has nothing on it except books so that she can take it to school to read.
1,My son is very happy for this tablet that I gave him for Christmas
1,Nice and light. Does not have as good of battery as advertised but still very nice.
1,"Bought this as a gift for a family member to replace an older tablet, works great."
0,Not Kid friendly at all. Purchased for little nephew. Wasn't given any info on it for sales person either. Took back!!!
1,It is a very good product and the attention of employees was very good
1,Bought this tablet for my grandmother and rooted it to remove all the amazon ware on it. She isn't technologically savvy but has loved playing with this tablet and is becoming a youtube expert. Can't go wrong for the price.

1,"Compact and very good for the price, good picture and sound quality"
1,"My old one was lifeless and so I replaced it with this. So glad I did, worth every penny!"
1,"When you consider the price paid for the Amazon Fire 7 tablet, it is much more economical than a IPAD or a Samsung tablet.. I use it to check mail, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites! Plus it is the perfect interface for all of the Amazon apps!"
1,"I absolutely love my Kindle fire! I'm able to do everything on it; read, watch videos, play games, listen to music, shop, etc."
1,"Amazon Fire Tablet: Catch up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments or chat with friends"
1,I purchased this for an 11 year old. This was more than enough for his games and videos.
1,Love the fire stick and the fire tv. We use the fire tv in our family room where our WIFI connection is weak. Streams beautifully!

1,So far the best streaming system I have tried. Even better than Appletv.
1,Bought this for my daughter and she uses it all the time. I highly recommend it!DD
1,"I love the size of the kindle. It is great to be able to put it in my purse. Also, main reason is I need to read outside sometimes and need to use sunglasses. The white paper make is real easy to read."
1,Bought this for my mother who is not so savvy with tablets but this one made it easy for her to use.
1,After several attempts to get help from Roku with no resolution I gave up and bought an Amazon Fire TV. This is by far the easiest to use. Love it!!!
1,it works that what counts
1,Love my Amazon Echo! Does all sorts of really cool things.
1,"The Fire tablet does everything I need it to do. Bought this as a gift for my 10 year old and he couldn't be happier. He can download all his games and apps, I like the parental controls on it."

1,i liked mine so much i bought another this one for my granddaughter
1,Its fast when you request artist songs and albums and weather
0,"For it's price point, this is a great little tablet. As long as your not looking for something to do everything, you'll be happy. This was given as a gift and the recipient was very happy with it."
1,"Really the best cheap tablet out there.It's equally great for those inclined to hack it and make it even more useful, and anyone who want a simple tablet. Works best if you have Amazon Prime."
1,"I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker and this was perfect. I think in order to get the full benefits its best to be a prime member so you can link your account and use prime music but also be able to utilize the tools like shopping list, checking past orders, etc. the only downside is it's not wireless. I know Amazon has made one that is wireless but I like the design of the echo."
1,This is a great starter tablet for kids and adults alike. It's always at a great price and works beautifully.
0,"Readers are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature, it has basic tools like camera(not very good), calculator, calendar, and the amazon appstore. I didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore, cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps I use the most on my cellphone. It is good for the price anyways..."
1,"This is the best thing I have ever bought, has amazing sound better than my Bose, she gives answers to your questions is fun to have takes very little space Love it"
1,"I have this paired with my Samsung Smart Things, WEMO devices, Smart Light Bulbs (LIFX and Sengled). She is pretty witty and very fun to mess around with and understands you even with music or TV on at loud volumes. I love the features and can't wait for more compatible devices to come out."
1,This is really a neat innovative tool. Would order
1,"It's great, but not too much memory. Bonus I was told that I could add a memory stick. Haven't done it yet, but like the possibility."
1,This device is so cool. I must buy for all gadget guys.
1,"Great e-reader, long battery life. Was hesitant to make the change from actual books to an e-reader but I have no regrets!"
1,This Amazon Fire TV box works as advertised. It was a breeze to set up and took me about five minutes to figure out how to use the features and functions.
1,A nice hands-free versatile piece of technology to have in the house.
1,Amazon TV is on par with Apple TV. I especially like toe original programming that Amazon offers.
1,Love it the size easy to carry and store would recommend to others
1,This is a great value for the money. With Amazon's apps for kids it has been alot of fun and easy to use.
1,"Purchased the Echo for my wife for Christmas. She loves to use it throughout the day asking questions, playing music and adding items to her shopping list. It is very useful and also easy to set up and use."
1,"This is the best 7"" tablet out there for under $50 - perhaps the best tablet for under $100. It is fast and reliable"
1,We had 1 fire tablet and we bought 2 more as gifts. We truly love these tablets. Very great purchase. Easy setup and use
1,I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.
1,"I really like my new Echo, which I received for Christmas. Love the fact that you can get the weather report, news, add items to your grocery list and listen to various music. You can find answers to questions without having to google it. I like it better than Siri."
1,Works smooth as butter. Better than chrome cast. All
1,I use my fire tv daily and it performs perfectly. I have a smart tv but the fire tv runs much faster.
1,"I'm a huge fan of these tablets. If you aren't trying to spend a lot of money, or if you aren't an avid daily user, this will easily do all the basic necessities"
1,"Very good for in bed watching of Amazon Prime shows. Not as fast as other options, but excellent for the price."
1,Works perfect and the price is right for my needs.
1,I love this little gadget. Alexa is fun and informative!. A great addition to the family.
1,"Love Alexa!!!!! She plays our music on command, keeps shopping and to do lists, gives weather reports etc. Every day I am learning more that she can do. Love it."
0,I am not too happy with the Kindle. It's ok but it seems to run slow and sometimes the sd card isn't reading. Would not purchase another
1,first tablet ive ever bought works great for reading
0,"My old Kindle Fire got pushed into the water by my cat, so I bought a new one. It's OK, but nothing to write home about. Kinda of slow and the size is a little awkward.....too narrow. It'll do, and the price is right, but if you can afford more, buy a better tablet."
1,I bought the Kindle Fire after I upgraded my primary tablet to a 10 inch. The 10 inch was too big to take to a coffee shop to read or to use outside. This is perfect size. I put a 2gb as card in it to hold my books. I can down load a couple of books and take it on the road.
0,"Bought this for a friend. It does the job (basic web and book reading) and at an affordable price. Nothing too fancy, but no problems."
1,I wanted to get my kids a tablet and this was the best option..Glad I made this decision my kids love the kindle
1,Before I switched to the Kindle white I was using Barnes and Noble Nook which had several down sides compared to the Kindle. Kindle battery last a long time compared to the Nook. Kindle does not jump pages like the Nook. Nook is very sensitive to touch and causes a lot of confusion when trying to find where you left off reading. My husband and I are very happy that we switched to Kindle especially since you have a greater selection of reading material through Amazon.
1,"Great addition for those that are building onto your smart home. Great connection with nest, hue lights and august lock. Have two dots as well. Great machines!"
1,"I bought 3 for my three granddaughters for Christmas. They love it. I love it too, free games, books, movies"
1,"I absolutely love this devise. I do wish ti was more compatible with more things, but it is still well worth it!!"
1,I loved this product. Excellent for the price. so much you can do on this. Also excellent for kids.
1,"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device."
0,"It's okay. When hooked up to my tv wirelessly, there seems to be a lot of lag. Seems to work better hard wired."
1,Had my first kindle (the original) for many years when I lost it. Love my new Kindle PaperWhite. Can read in the dark.
0,"Amazon is at the forefront of 4K content, offering several shows in HDR. Then why isn't their very own streaming player capable of displaying it? And at only 30 fps to boot. This was obviously built to a price but if you've already shelled out the money for a 4K TV wouldn't you want it to be able to display all that it's capable of? The Roku is, at present, the far superior product."
1,granddaughter loves it and easy and durable. loves the pink case.
0,Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.
1,"This is extremely easy to use, packed with abilities, and has internet capabilities. I can't believe all of this for such a low price. This is the only tablet anyone needs."
1,"This is my second tablet, my daughter love it, just the perfect gift."
1,Great for listening to music. You save alot of time on the internet just asking your questions to Alexa.
0,For $50 i wasnt expecting high end screen resolution.
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet is easy to use, easy to download books, and I love it"
1,"Good tablet. Keeps my neice busy for hours, and we usually have to take it from her so she can sleep."
1,Great for an inexpensive tablet for around the house.
1,The uses for this item was worth every penny. 99$ was a small price to pay.
1,Just bought as a travel companion. Something to watch movies and play games on. So far it has been great. The picture is great. It's really clear.
1,I love this. It's has so much to offer for a great price. Super fast and easy to use!
1,"I use Alexa for fun facts, listening to music and telling weather. I also use it to turn on and off some Wemo lights I installed. I bought this one as a gift for a close friend, and she loves it too."
1,My kid enjoys watching his cartoons on the fire tv
1,Great price. Maybe too small for those who need reading glasses but refuse to wear them during usage of tablet.
1,It was pretty cheap and you can surf the web. a good buy for the bucks.
1,Love the product. And the place I would recommend them to everyone.
1,"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it."
1,Echo is fun to have but does not offer all I thought it would. Difficult to get answers to simple questions
0,It gets the job done...................Great to buy......
1,I would not know where to start. It is the best among the the field of Android TV. Voice call is second to none. I have recommended it to more than 3 of my frieds.
1,This is prerfict for my kids and my needs! We love reading the books and when a game is wanted or watching Netflix it is so easy!
1,"The Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) works really well, the only negative thing is my remote stopped working after the first day, but I downloaded the app on my phone and it works really well., I have the box behind my tv, and have no problem controlling it with my phone."
1,Highly recommend purchasing as a starter tablet and/or for a younger child. Internet access through Silk Browser and most common apps available through App Store.
1,Have not received mine but have spent many hours with my friends it really is amazing great fun.
1,Alexa is always learning and Amazon is adding new functions but sometimes (like all of the voice assistants) she sometimes can't understand the request.
1,Very good tablet for my daughter she has really enjoyed it
1,My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
1,Great device for cable cutters. I just wish it had vudu.
1,Whether if you have cable or not (we don't)- this is an amazing device to have. Many movies to choose from.
1,"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer..."
1,We have spotty radio reception so going through the internet is ideal. I could have done the same thing with a speaker for about the same price. However this is more versatile as I can send messages to others and make lists plus more features are being added all the time!!
1,"Excellent product, I use it for everything, especially for music and weather."
1,Just bought his a week ago. It works great in recognizing our voices and commands.
1,I use my Amazon fire TV as a replacement for my cable box. I have an Amazon prime membership and I watch their content plus I use the service sling to watch live TV.
1,Great reading experience. All your books in one place. Compact. Excellent!!
1,"I use Alexa all the time to set temperature, water the lawn, play music. This is definitely a product worth having if you have a smart home."
1,This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
0,We love it (that's me & my wife) . My son & daughter-in law & 2 grand-girls all love it.
1,I purchased this for my brother in law who just needed something to surf the web. Set up was easy and he was on the internet within minutes of unboxing.
1,All the icons on the tablet works just fine. I got help
1,"My first kindle paperwhite lasted several years, and I used it a lot! When it quit, I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased another one. After only about five weeks, my new kindle stopped working. I could no longer turn the page again, just like my old one. I went back to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a new one. If it had been just about another week, they would not have exchanged it. I thought the Kindle was a great product, but was disappointed that it had quit again. This time, I bought the insurance plan. Best Buy treated me great. There was never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund. Even though I did not have my original receipt, only had my charge card bill, there was not a problem."
0,It did not meet my expectations and was pretty slow.
1,Easy to use. Quick setup. Fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant.
1,Very nice and efficient gadget that is so user friendly that even our young kids love to use
1,Enjoy the fun facts each morning...also use it in the morning to find out the results of the late night baseball scores
1,"I love Amazon tablets. You got the best of Amazon and android apps in one device. And, for $50, you can't beat the value! I highly recommend purchasing this tablet."
1,"Got this tablet for $35 for an older family friend and it is simple to use. Certainly doesn't have a ton of capability, but is more than adequate for basic email, web surfing and taking photos/videos."
1,"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift."
1,This works wonderful. We cancelled Direct tv and went with is instead. Love it.
1,Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
1,"My 8 year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet. He did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the features that this was the tablet for him. He can connect to our home Wi Fi to access the internet, You Tube and games. We monitor what he is accessing for safety purposes. This is much smaller than an iPad, but is very mobile and easy for kids to use. I bought a case for it to protect it from drops and allows my son to work from multiple angles on the tablet."
1,This is a great buying experience from bestbuy. delivery is so fast and the product is amazing. Thumbs up for this product and bestbuy.
1,"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money."
1,my grandson loves it plays it all time loves the app. store
1,Got these for my 4 and 11 year old on Black Friday when they were 34$. Typically our household is Apple only. But I couldn't justify buying another iPad. Works great. Not as many of her favorite apps as the iPad but still a hit.
1,"This Kindle is much lighter than my old 2nd generation Kindle. The ads are no problem at all, as they only appear when the Kindle is in sleep mode. The back light is great, so is the price!"
1,This device has done everything my family has asked if it and easy enough for my kids to not have to teach me how to use it
1,"I am a teacher and was looking for an inexpensive way for my students play educational games. So far, they are working as I hoped."
1,It is very light and easy to handle. It fits the rack on my treadmill without blocking heart rate info. Took some getting used to but now I like the new home page which shows front cover of the book.
1,I was resistant to putting down my real books and begin using a kindle. I'm so glad I did. It's so convenient to shop and instantly download a book. Plus no more storing hundreds on books in my house.
1,I bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it!
1,"the perfect gift, excellent price good device !!!!"
1,i love the alexa voice service i can turn on my lights and order pizza with my voice through the fire tv.. the apps are the same as any other media device.. games are good too..
1,"Sound is good. Very convenient for getting weather, setting alarms, news updates. Alexa sounds so much like a real person. Love that!"
1,"very good product. Exactly what I wanted, and a very good price"
1,Best E-book reader. You can purchase books from any provider other than Amazon and send it to your kindle e-mail account.
1,No glare anywhere--even on the beach! Also you can read in the dark with no problems.
1,"Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge!"
1,Purchased one for my mother who likes to read a lot but not really internet savy. She loves it. And cannot beat the price. she uses it mainly for reading however. I bought it on Black Friday for under $50.00
1,"This tablet is much faster than my 2012 Nexus 7, a perfect replacement at a great price."
1,"My husband and I have had a great time checking out all the fun features of the Echo. We are very impressed with the instantaneous answers to our questions. What a fun ""toy."""
1,"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work"
1,Bought 2 for kids taking a long flight . It was perfect size for movies and games. Easy travel size
1,The best kindle that I ever had!It is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.Great for indoor and outdoor reading

1,Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
1,"I( read the reviews and even listened to this in store. But much to my chagrin, at high volume, this will not cut it. The portability is great!"
1,Easy to use. Easy on the eyes. We actually own 2. We have owned older version Kindles and this is the best one so far.
1,"I have purchased 4 Kindle Fire 7 tablets for my grandsons, and they love playing games on them whether they are educational games or just-for-fun games."
1,The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?
1,"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
1,The amazon echo is a great the voice recognition works fantastic

1,Excellent sound and great value. Used every day by entire family.
1,I bought one of these for my father. He loves it and I noticed it is very well built like if it was built the same way as the Amazon Fire box which I am very impressed by how well built it is. Even the battery terminals are polished chrome tabs. I mean come on what company goes to that much trouble. The charger reminded be of an I-phone charger. Impressed by this little tablet I will have to pick one up for myself now in the near future. Good product for the buck!
1,Good tablet at a good price. Great for your basic tasks.
1,I'm so happy with my purchase! Very easy to install. Love the interface. Well priced. Haven't had any issues.
1,Nice product for the money. Bought for an elderly person. Hope she will like it as I do!
1,We have joined the modern world and now have access to more viewing opportunities than we imagined. The best part is that this technology allows us to speak our request.
1,"Awesome battery, does every thing I need it to. I love it."
0,Good just complicated too many apps to download...
1,"BOUGHT ON BLACK FRIDAY FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE THOUGHT I PAID 100.00 MORE FOR IT. IT DOES A LOT. SHE LOVES IT."
1,I have 3 Roku devices and I'm totally impressed by this. Amazon hit it out of the park!
1,Great for watching movies when traveling. Perfect for watching on an airplane.
1,It is a great tablet. Both of my kids have one. Would buy another one.
1,Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
1,It's a kindle...great kindle for a great price. Expandable memory can be used to expand your movie or game library. It also has great sound and picture quality.
1,Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend
1,The sound is good and voice volume control is real nice. There are skills you need to find to do really so much. Learning what to say is getting better for me. I plan on buying a dot next.
1,This item is great. I would buy it again. Highly recommended.
1,We've been a FIRE fan since day-one and this one does not disappoint! Get it! You won't regret it!
1,"Very small and handy, very easy to use, and Perfect for travel."
1,makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.
1,My mother in law was so happy to get this tablet. She cried when she opened our gift at Christmas. It is easy to use and easy to navigate. She is a first time tablet user at almost 70 years old.. And has never used a smartphone either..she now spends most of her time on it. Great tablet for the price. Definitely recommend
1,My granddaughter loves this. It is perfect for her to play her games and entertain herself for a long time.
1,For the price this tablet can't be beat. My wife mostly uses it 4 reading and Amazon shopping. It does everything she needs it to do. Battery life is very good as well.
1,"Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy"
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet its self I give a 4, I thought it had the Google Play Store on it and the kids couldn't find the games & stuff they wanted But my youngest loves it! Walking him through the whole process ( after the other kids tried it out I did a system restore back to factory settings) I liked it and so did my son! So all in all I think 4 Fits well!"
1,"This streaming content box packs a lot of punch for it's size. Very responsive to your commands whether using handheld remote or voice activation. Very easy to set up, register, and use.Some of the content is a little misleading as you need to look for the prime banner otherwise you have to purchase to watch which was a surprise for me as when I saw all the selections, I was excited about all the offerings. Some of the movies I wanted to see, weren't even available. But there is still plenty of other stuff to watch. I'll give it a year trial to see if its really worthwhile, but seems ok so far when you bring music content and free 2 day shipping into the package."
1,The perfect gift paired with an amazon gift card for books and a case
1,Great for kids that mostly play games and stream videos.
1,We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.
1,I would recommend this buy. Better than the firestick.
1,This Tablet is awesome. Easy to set up and navigate.Compact. Easy to hold.
1,"great for the price, did research and found this #"
1,Got 3 on Black Friday for as gifts. My parents loved it and they manage to set it up by themselves so it's definetly user friendly
1,This tablet is a great price. Perfect for those who use Amazon and want to use Amazon apps.Don't let the low price and screen size fool you. Works flawlessly. It has long battery life and a bright display. This is a must-have item for $50.
1,"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it."
1,Not a bad product but you only need this if your streaming or viewing 4k content on a 4k tv
1,"First off you can't go wrong with the price, $50 (or if you can even catch it on sell) is a steal for any piece of Tech. Now I've seen people compare this to an ipad or samsung tablet, which you can't. This doesn't have retina display or anything like that, But for the price point it does a good job. I've had mine since the black firday sell and its still been working really good. I also got one for my mom and my nephew. I generally use mine for emails and amazon orders along with reading the time to time book, netflix, and the few games that I've purchased. My mom and nephew use it mainly to play games. If your looking for retina display or something with apple or andriod features and don't mind the extra $150 or $300 bucks by all means I suggest getting one of the higher end tablets. But I can't complain with this new Amazon fire 7 as it works just as good for me. I'd recommend buying a sd card however if you want a little extra space."
1,Allows my teens to access apps and Internet while still reading on down time between games
1,"I absolutely love Alexa (the wake-up name for the Echo). She tells me a funny fact every morning after I say ""Alexa, good morning"" then I tell her to play my favorite wake-up song(Good Morning Starshine) followed by the local weather and morning news. I get free music all day long from Amazon Prime and I can always hear a Chuck Norris joke. The sound quality is amazing, comparable to a Bose system and it was perfect for our last party. I get updates all the time for new stuff Alexa can do. I love my Echo and find it endlessly fascinating!"
1,I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it. I just wished I would have bought him the next size up.
1,Cheap tablet that pretty much does everything!!!!!
1,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.
1,We have other Kindle Fire tablets and were wanting to purchase one for our granddaughter for Christmas. She loves this tablet and is a great fit for her.
0,"It is too narrow, if watching a vid or utube, some of the pic is cut off. Can't erase the entire history. It keeps it and then recommends still based on your history, even tho you have cleared it. Amazon selling ALL the time is very tiresome. I never go to an ad that follows me from site to site yet it's ubiquitous. Tiresome. Had the fire 8.9 hdx. It was Perfect and they discontinued it for this line. It is a fingerprint magnet! Have to clean it daily."
1,"Whether you need the weather, information about something, a recipe or even just music, the Echo is right there to help. I haven't even used a third of the ability of the Echo but am very impressed with what I have used."
1,"I bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. She has come to love it. She is constantly reading. Lighting wasn't an issue or I would have gotten the reader.When she isn't reading, I borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. Not a iPad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. Prior to the Amazon Fire she was reading on the iPhone 6+.a"
1,Really like the echo. This is my second one. I put this one in the kitchen. I got this one because of the size and needed one to be centrally located in my house.
1,"This is a awesome tablet. For the price it is a awesome tablet. It is perfect size to play games. Though little small for watching videos, it works perfect for daily use."
1,Very smooth and easy to use. I would buy another..
1,This was a purchase for Christmas! Great tablet to surf the web or read books on! Would recommend for any age!
1,My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.
1,So user friendly that I had it for over a month before I read the owners guide to learn all the other features. Makes reading a book effortless. A must have for the avid book reader.
1,"It's not the echo but for what I paid, it's well worth every penny"
1,The Amazon Echo is not bad. She seems pretty intelligent but sometimes she doesn't seem to understand simple questions.
0,"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application."
1,While it doesn't understand everything we say it still is cool and plays most songs we think of.
1,"Really enjoy using this. Great for adding groceries to a list or, with additional equipment, turning on lights. Listening to music or the news, I use this more than originally thought."
1,It was a great purchase for my grandson. He enjoys the tablet and it seems to be easy for him to use.
1,"For the price, I feel like if you complain about anything, you're just going to sound crazy. I got this on Black Friday special, which was awesome. I use this for home automation and playing clash of clans. If you're big into Amazon stuff, this also has a nice selection of amazon apps."
1,"Is easy to use, great to look up words you dont know as you go along.Its also great that the light isnt shone up into your eyes, it makes it so that they dont get easily tired and they dont hurt."
1,We have gotten rid if cable and just use the fire sticks. What a big savings from the high price of cable.
1,Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
1,I love being able to tell Alexa to turn off the lights when I have forgotten to turn them off.
1,"This is my first tablet and I think it is wonderful. I can do so much on it and I use it everywhere I go. It's the perfect size for me because it fits in my lunch bag and my apron pocket at work. I can do all the same things on it as I do on my laptop computer except edit spreadsheets and text docs. However, I can view them on the tablet."
1,"Bought this for someone over 70 who likes to learn new things. Works great and keeps them on their toes for sure. It is fun and helpful, everyone ended up loving it."
1,"I bought this Amazon Fire to replace the one I had. My old one need to have the power button replaced and the cost to do that was more than what I paid for the new one. I like that I can take pictures (which I couldn't do with my old one) and it feels lighter. I can read my books, check my email and surf the web. The only negative thing is that I still haven't figure out how to print from it. It was a lot easier from the old one. I'm still exploring all the apps that are preloaded."
1,"Great product.i can stream almost anything.Netflix Hulu, you name it.this product is the best."
1,I needed a tablet which I can use without worrying about damaging it. This is perfect for that purpose.
1,"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
1,ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ITEM. UPLOAD ANYTHING FAST!!
1,Purchased 5 of these for my grandkids ages from 4-9. They were all able to work the tablet easily.
1,Easy to use this device and the sound is great. We continue to find new ways to use it
1,"Not quite as accurate as the commercials imply, but good for music and ""parlor"" tricks like asking sillly questions."
1,"I purchased this item during the Black Friday at Best Buy, not only was it dirt cheap at the time of the purchase, But my kids also love it as well. The great thing is that I am also able to monitor what they download and purchase without me having to get the tablet."
1,"This device is perfect for converting that ""dumb"" TV in your home to a ""smart"" one. Also, perfect for that TV that has limited apps. This comes with everything!"
1,"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
1,the echo helps me keep tract of daily and monthy events..Hoping later to use it to play music and use it to make the house more efficent.
1,I enjoy it it connect fast it's small but I needed something I can put on my purse
1,Easy to use Does a good job of voice recognition
1,I purchased 2 one for my wife the other for my college aged daughter both are enjoying the product immensely !
1,Good product.......................................
1,I tend to use this ore than my ipad. this has got to be the best bargain for a fully functional tablet I have ever seen. I now have three of these devices and may get another.
0,Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.
1,I love the picture quality and the voice feature on the remote is priceless. Would buy again!!!
1,My wife thought tablet was to bright this more like reading book. Keeps charge alot longer and works with amazon prime. So this very good purchase at very good price!!!
1,i was hesitant about the echo i used att a friends house loved it
1,Bought this fire for someone as a Christmas gift and it was the best gift given that day. It is perfect for any small online tasks one would like to do and absolutely perfect for reading books!
1,"Echo is amazing. Takes a few days for her to learn , then seems to take on a personality. A little disappointed to start with but downloaded apps and Alexa is fun! Pretty much a toy. Here but can answe questions play music just a fun extension to a computer. Kids love it and so does my husband."
1,This a great product for everyone. I would recommend it
1,Got this as a birthday gift for my wife..she loved it!
1,Bought it for my mother. She works at a beauty salon so she's always busy. Echo works great for her. She loves it. Works great on her galaxy s7
1,This product should get product of the year award it is the most amazing piece of technology I have purchased this year it can control your schedule play music from Pandora and I heart radio controlled the lights in my home turned the TV on and off with voice commands so far I haven't seen anything else quite like this it's absolutely amazing.
0,"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet"
1,"I have to admit, I have not used the Echo has much as I should. But anytime I use it I really like it. I simply forget to use it. What I do like is using the timer."
0,"Unless you have fiber optic internet, don't buy this. If you have ATT Uverse it will mess up the TV, lower the speed of your internet, and play havoc with the phone.It has not worked yet since getting it, since I only have 25mgb of internet, and it really does not work at that speed at all."
1,Only wish games worked without internet once downloaded
1,Ready to buy another pleased with item overall easy to use
1,"Great image quality, fast device. Jumped to this from Nook and would never go back."
1,i love the kindle fire 7 tablet. it is wonderful and awesome.
1,I bought three tablets for my children of various ages. They play with it everyday. It was difficult to find apps that are similar to Google Play. I did find some apps that they enjoy.pros: easy to usecons: it take time to find apps that you really want if you are use to the google play store.
1,"If one is new to tablets, this little table is a good introduction to the tablet world. Much can be learned and accomplished for the small investment. Try one!"
1,"Its a great tablet, mostly use for web browsing and book reading. Great value!"
1,It 's the perfect gift for a senior who has never owned a computer but understands the cellphone.
1,Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems
1,"I love how light and convenient it is to carry around. This is beyond worth it for an avid eBook purchaser. I signed up to Prime for my son and none of the chapter books that he really wanted were ever available - not an issue with the kindle - just content that would be relevant for subscription (ie kid magazines) aren't necessarily available on the Paperwhite. Just remember, it's not a tablet, which is lovely if you only want some good uninterrupted reading."
1,Very great purchase. She gives the weather and sports
1,This is my third kindle. I mainly bought this one so that I would be able to read on the beach.So far I really like it.
1,My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.
1,Wonderful and fast little tablet. It already servesany uses...
1,Do not know why I did not think about getting one of these earlier. This is one we just leave around for anyone to use as the price is so great and most of us use it for internet and playing. have not gotten the chance to read a book on it yet but hoping that will change in the new year.
1,Don't waste money on the kid program friendly ones that's what Locks are for
1,I haven't had any issues so far with my tablet. The only downside I am aware of is that I can't use it outdoors without getting a lot of glare.
1,I upgraded from the fire stick to this. The fire tv runs much faster than my fire stick. Great product.
1,A must have in every house . My wife uses it every day
1,I upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old Kindle died. I like the paperwhite screen. I hate that the pop up adds and recommendations have absolutely no connection to my reading history. It's very different from earlier Kindles so I'm still learning features. I can't understand why the paperwhite costs 2-3 times what the Kindle Fire costs.
1,Definitely the best streaming box in the market especially the new 4K version. I love this box better than Apple box.
1,"This is my second Echo. If you have a smart home, you need thus. It's the brains."
1,I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.
1,"This is a great little tablet. I can go on line, watch movies, check email, play games and more."
1,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV. I like both first and second versions of the AFTV, unless your programming is broadcast in 4K, you won't notice the picture quality of the two versions. It has all the Apps you will need and available to sideload if it's not available thru Amazon. Voice command only works with downloaded Apps. Overall, I like AFTV over 3rd Gen Apple TV...."
1,"At first I didn't think this equipment was of much value when someone pointed it out to me. However after I got to thinking about it, I considered how much easier it would be to use as opposed to the keyboard. After using it, I've found that's not only is it much easier & faster, it's much more accurate as well."
1,I own a FIRE HD tablet. It is a good handy device to have. Simple to operate and works great for what I need. I bought this as a gift to my nephew for Christmas - and he is enjoying it too. Great device for a very affordable price.
1,Best box. Really like it so far and having 4 k is nice
1,"There will be a learning curve when you take it out of the box. Once you learn the correct way to say a command, it is nice unit to use. And those jokes - they're groaners that will bring a smile to your face. Sleep timer is a nice feature. ""Alexa"" does not like it when you speak in a loud voice - you must talk to her in a normal voice."
1,works and is light
1,Nephew loved to play games and listen to music. He never puts it down. Very good buy.
1,We bought the tablet for my 1 year old who normally uses my iPad and Samsung tablet because we wanted him to have his own so we could have ours. He was very disengaged. I believe it's because it didn't have the home and back button like our tablets do. Over all it's an amazing device it just didn't keep our little one entertained
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight and simple to use! I love my kindle! It looks just like I'm reading a regular book but I don't have to worry about flipping pages I just slide my finger or tap!
1,This thing is great for music and gave a group of my friends quite an entertaining evening playing with Amazon echo.
1,"Got this one for black friday, no complains at all, the price its great, and the tablet its worth it, now i connect my fire stick easily"
1,"This is my second Kindle. And again bought just a basic reader. For the convenience, choice of reading materials, comfort of reading, a Kindle can not be beat."
1,"My wife and I both enjoyed our Kindle Voyage so much that we had to buy a second one. This is our first E-reader, and it could not be more user-friendly. It works well in all kinds of environments and lighting conditions. A definite winner!"
1,Good product other than having to purchase additional apps for it to work.
1,I really like the echo but I am still trying to find out what else it can do for me. I do plan on getting the controllable lights and thermostat down the road but in the mean time it is still limited. Overall great idea.
1,over all it worked. was slower than my kindle paperwhite
1,Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.
1,this is perfect size for my grandson - plays the games and stores all the things he needs to do to solve all fights with his brother
1,comes with tons of stuff and you can download a ton more best money I've spent in a while
1,Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.
1,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....
1,"Great device. Some limitations, but she is not God."
1,My kid loves this tablet. not expensive and the battery lasts a long time.
1,I really like the auto on off feature. Volume control could be more ergonomic.
1,it's easy to set up and start enjoying Amazon Prime.
1,I like the amazon stream with this tablet. Fast and good quality.
1,"This is a great tablet to own if you use AMAZON apps for shopping,reading, videos and so forth. May at times be a little slow but other than that no problems"
1,Purchased this as a gift on Black Friday got a great price. Very happy with the quality.
1,Gave my younger twins the Echo an they love telling Alexa what to do. Their older sister is named Alexa.
1,"Best thing ever! Since I bought the fire stick, I hardly watch regular TV. We are thinking about cutting off our cable to save money because the fire stick gives us every show/movie we need from regular cable."
1,I bought this so I can stream the playstation vue app and it works great. Very speedy and seems to be faster than the Roku 4. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to cut cords and want a set top box for streaming.
1,My 3 year old has one and my 10 year old wanted one so now they BOTH have one. The parental controls are easy to use and work great. I would highly recommend to anyone!
1,"This tablet is a nice gift for my granddaughters , they spending a lot of time reading books on this and they have a fun time with the games . Love it"
1,My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.
1,like the individual charger as i do not always have a usb port device with me when i travel
1,Excellent tablet. Love the size. Fits perfectly in my purse. I would recommend this tablet.
1,"This is our family's 3rd fire tablet, great, affordable solution for our family"
1,Wonderful products and works for exactly what I need it to work for
1,I use to have the original but it didn't light up so it was a deal breaker for me. Now I can read anywhere at anytime!
1,I love just asking Alexa to play something. No more turning on the radio and looking for a station to play.
1,I mainly use for listening to music and it works great to have between the kitchen and living room. I was already an Amazon Prime member so set up was extremely easy. Family likes to ask Alexa silly questions...it's a little entertaining.
0,I am not impressed at all I think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead. This is a expensive item and doesn't do enough for the money you spent. The weather timers adding things to your calendar that's just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesn't understand
1,I'm constantly using this to watch movies almost replaced the need for cable.
1,Really nice and easy to use.It's my first tablet and I love it.
1,The antenna with power booster pulls in more than 30 HD channels. It takes very little room and works very well. Great for supplementing cable on other sets.
1,Excellent item I just bay it from Best bay ita very good for the kids
1,Works well. No problems with this item. Easy to set up.
1,My old kindle finally bit the dust after about 5 years or so. Had to run out to get a new one right away. Was sad that it cost so much now. My old one was about 1/3 the cost. Worth it for how much I use it.
1,Works perfectly for my kindle
1,"Replaced Uverse with Amazon Fire TV PlayStation Vue, good streaming, easy to use, compact footprint."
0,The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.
1,"I never thought it would be possible to get rid of my cable television services, but I did."
1,This is one of the best streaming boxes I've had. Can easily interface it with kodi and also anything you may have on your kindle fire integrates as well. It's an awesome little box. Would purchase it again in a heartbeat.
1,The Fire Tv. Stick and fire Tablet are great for beginners
1,"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
1,"Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
1,Best Fire tablet for a small price. Works well for my first tablet. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good affordable tablet.
1,"i was totally impressed with the tablet great speed great camera the sound was a little low. i loved the price and I will recomend it to my friends. The costumer service was good and staff very friendly , Thank you"
1,"I got this for my wife and she loves it. She is old school and likes her toggle buttons on the old one. However, she likes being able to read anywhere at anytime. The back light is not over powerful. I was happy to hear this because I wasn't sure if I should have got the one that auto detects ambient light."
1,"Haven't had the Echo very long but so far I love it. News and weather when I get up, music as I take care of cores. Ordered Smart plugs for my lamps. Can't wait to try them out!"
1,My 3 year old has gone through 2 tablets prior to her kids fire. I love the parental control and easy use. She loves the apps available through Prime! She drops it daily with no damage to the tablet thanks to the protective case! Thanks for making a very durable product with an incredible warranty!
1,"Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it."
1,"We give these out pre-loaded with course material and they are great. With the amount of stuff that we pre-load, printing would be cost prohibitive."
1,Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
1,I enjoy getting Anwsers to questions quickly and verbally. No need to sign in. Can listen to music too. Fun device.
1,I brought 3 of them. 2 were gifts. We love them. Awesome price.
1,Better then my old kindle. More features. I'm able to return my library books where on the old one they would have to expire.
1,Bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas as they were always on mine.
1,Again after some time I just use it for music like the google one I started out with but was unhappy. I wish it looked better since it's pretty ugly. Also the lights are on the top so unless your standing next to it your not sure it's actually hearing you speak which can be frustrating from across the room needing to repeat your self over and over. It it's better at answering random questions then google.
1,"Budget tablet, nice and crisp picture. HD quality product."
1,This has been a great tablet specially for children.
1,INEXPENSIVE GREAT TABLET/E-READER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1,My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
0,I can't figure out how to use without switching out the hd1 plugs continuously .
1,Loveeeeeeeee........................................
1,Love my Echo! I am still new to the process and am learning how to use it. Listening to music is a great pleasure! The sound is so rich and enjoyable. I look forward to learning more about it and installing Echo-compatible products in my home.
1,"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
1,My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer
1,All I bought this for is to wake up in morning easier. It wakes me during my lightest part of sleep within a 30 minute window . That was what made me get this over fitbit.
1,"This is easy to set up, we love the music and looking up info"
1,The Amazon Fire is an affordable alternative to some other tablets on the market. A great value. I like the fact that it's memory is expandable.
1,I love this Echo device. I can order items from amazon very easily and turn lights on and off. I recommend this fun gadget
1,I like the product and would tell others about it.
1,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no handsyou can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit."
1,"My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best."
1,Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
1,"It have lots of apps, you don't need cable tv if you own , only data svc"
1,I like the paperwhite read its smaller then my tablet can go anywhere with me and I enjoy reading books on it
1,"I bought this tablet for my soon to be 2 yr old. I wanted to download him some games and a couple apps to help him learn. He doesn't speak right now and uses sign language to communicate. This tablet works great. It's just his size, easy to use and paired with the soft foam carrying case I bought it from Amazon it's the best thing I've done for him lately. Would highly recommend for any and all ages."
1,it is nice item my grandchildren enjoy playing with
1,"After experimenting for several months with an Echo Dot, I decided to take the plunge when the Echo showed up online at a deep discount. Like the Dot, setup was easy. Sound quality is awesome. Sometimes it works too good as it listens to everything all the time. Its going to be fun to use just the same."
0,"I liked the sound quality coming out of the Echo. I ended up returning this for an Echo Dot. The Dot is 1/3rd of the price and for my townhouse, I don't need a high powered speaker. Alexa is great to use, no matter what Echo device you have."
1,Bought for kids like how sturdy they are my son has dropped his twice and it must keeps on going. Also. Added Amazon prime which is a great deal.
1,"My grandkids wanted this for obvious reasons and when I saw it go on sale on BB, I jumped at the chance and bought it. The kids love it."
1,Bought for grandkids. They love playing the games that game with it.
1,"My Amazon Echo did not power back on after we had a loss of power, even though we had it plugged into a surge protector. I am almost a full year out of warranty for my echo and Amazon sent me this power plug for free and almost like magic my Echo came back to life as soon as it was plugged in with this new power adapter. Yay, we have Alexa back in our lives! Hooray!"
1,This is a great tablet for this price. Display is very nice and you get all the features of Android in this. The camera and speaker are not so great though. Excellent gift for new tablet users.
0,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
1,"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video."
1,This is a very compact Kindle; great for reading your favorite novels on the go!
1,"My daughter love it, she always get busy with it.."
1,We love it. Great product We heard about it from family
0,Fast up to 5 windows open without problemsCamera not very good pics come out blurry
1,I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.
1,This tablet is able to do everything other tablets do. It has expandable memory and you are able to download apps from the play market.
1,It's so easy to use and the price is very affordable.
1,I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost.
1,This is one of my best buys for the year so far. Fire tv is super fast and love that you can hard wire it to the Internet. So much can be done with it aside from watching tv and movies which is a huge plus in itself. Love this thing.
1,"Before buying the FireTV, I had the FireTV Sticks. In an effort to cancel my cable, I signed up for Sling TV."
1,I use my tablet for business and am very satisfied with it. It has excellent resolution and I have not experienced slowness. Good product.
1,Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it.
1,"Great tool for kids, special when you don't need to $$$ to much."
1,You can't buy a lousy no brand for this price. Kid friendly. Don't you cringe when your wife gives her brand new iPhone or iPad to the 2 year old. Download apps and a movie or two from Disney and you can have a long peaceful drive in the car with a happy child. If you've bought movies with digital copies you can download them to this device for free. You need to buy a memory chip to expand memory capacity. Plenty of free apps on amazon as well. We bought several on black Friday and have no regrets..
1,"I gave this Amazon charger only four stars, because even though it does a great job of charging my new Paperwhite quickly it should be included with the reader and not sold separately."
1,"I love this product. I have it on the kitchen counter and use it to save to my grocery list. Then when I go to the store, I just pull the shopping list on the phone app. Other features - I use it to leave messages to other members of the family, help me convert cooking measurements when increasing the number of servings for a recipe, etc. Each day I discover a new feature I can use."
1,"Got this for Black Friday and the price was awesome, great for kids, easy to use and battery life is good! Nice charger and screen resolution is great. Great tablet overall"
1,"Solid piece of equipment, very reliable and streams great, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,"my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !"
1,Bought this for my 8 year old for Christmas. She loves it. She's been playing on it since she opened it.
1,"I researched several streaming devices but because of my experience with Amazon Kindle Fire and the reviews read for the Fire TV I decided to do the Amazon Fire TV. Set up was easy (the hardest part was opening the remote to put the batteries in!). Once everything was hooked up, the instructions and tips video really helped get everything started. The only negative I will say is that this product did not include the HDMI cable (other brands did) but that was explained on the box and by the sales associate. I enjoyed this so much that I ordered the TV Stick for my bedroom TV. (And have recommended this product to friends and co-workers.)"
1,"I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I'm sure I will learn more as needed."
1,"I initially bought an echo because of the Hue light system and Nest Thermostat control that it can give with just your voice. While these things work wonderfully, boy was I surprised when I discovered many of the other things it can do! My wife and I are avid readers, but with two small children, we don't have the time as often anymore. We were surprised to see that alexa could not only play audio books, but could read ANY book from our kindle library! Additionally the sound quality is quite good for the size of the device. My only (minor) complaint is that the bass sound is lacking some at higher volumes. Otherwise, you should most certainly buy one!"
1,"Turns any tv with hdmi into a smart tv, great apps"
1,"I gave this tablet to my 6yr old for Christmas, she is enjoying it very much. I was surprised how good the quality was for the price I would definitely recommend it."
1,It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.
1,"I actually purchased these tablets for some students that attend an after school program at the Salvation Army, but I also have a Kindle Fire as my personal tablet."
1,Good good good good had a lot of shows on it and it is good good good
1,"My whole family has really enjoyed this, my kids love the music, I love the kitchen timer and being able to will check the weather for the day.I have set up the automated lighting control and I am in the process of converting a lot of our lighting to smart lighting."
1,"have heard so much about echo ,I had to try it out. Setting up with my router was a little hard but finally got it and when disconects again it back up on its own, nice to ask about weather or what ever and not have to grab my phone need to get prime music account so can listen to any or all music on there but for now really happy glad I got it,good price too."
1,This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!
1,I have a Roku as well and this is just as fast and has a comparable picture quality.
1,Watching lots of shows without any issues. Easy to setup
1,"System over-all is fast and I mean for less that $50, its very reliable.The only downside, its uses almost 50% of the internal storage already, OS and built-in apps ... Should have settled for 32GB or more.Other than that, this toy is just ok :)"
1,I originally had a firestick and it worked okay. Upgraded to the box and it is much faster and no lag. Definitely buy a keyboard to go with it.
1,Alexa is a good friend and she is always ready to listen to me and if I don't know something she does I would recommend
1,This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to. The fact that it's blue is a bonus!
1,I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. For a pure reading device I do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.
1,"I am highly satisfied with the quality of this product. It has met every expectation for me and I would highly recommend to everyone. Better than holding a heavy book in your hand to read,."
1,My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.
1,This a great add on for non smart (older) televisions with a USB port.
1,Very nice. Really enjoy it. Really like the paper appearance of the screen.
1,"The Fire Tv is better then the Chrome,Roku and Even the Apple Tv, Yes i said it, Its Better then Apple TV And its Cheaper to! Also KODI .."
1,"Lots of cool features, especially enjoy the shopping list feature."
1,The echo is a great addition to our house. Love that you can ask her anything. It always answers instant. Wife uses the timer all the time. Plus now she listens to music all the time.
0,"It's a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever. The ads are annoying but then again you can't expect too much with the price point. However, I would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because it's very slow and finicky at times but if you're tired of giving your kids your phone/tablet this is the product for you. Just make sure you take off your payment info, maybe even make their own personal amazon account."
1,"I was having issue with the wifi for my main laptop, so I needed something that I could check email and writer posts on. Now I mostly use it to play games and watch shows through apps. With all of that, the battery only lasts for a little over 3 hours before it needs to be charged. The tiny charger that comes with it isn't that long, so don't expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it's charging. So if you need or want something that's bigger than the average phone screen to watch movies, read and check email or read books, I think this is a good bet."
1,I needed a good tablet for my niece and my nephew.
1,It is as amazing as I expected. Reading with a kindle is just reading a book!
1,More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.
0,"Will not stay connected to WiFi. When it is connected, device has to be within 6-8 ft. of router. Need this in the kitchen. Don't want to walk 25+ feet to use it. My other wifi devices work everywhere in the house as well as most of yard and garden. So I don't get it. Sick of looking at it - useless."
0,It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi
1,"Is easy to use, great to look up words you don´t know as you go along.It´s also great that the light isn´t shone up into your eyes, it makes it so that they don´t get easily tired and they don´t hurt."
1,"I love reading on the kindle Paperwhite in any light. Dark, Sun. It doesn't matter. Plus you can borrow Kindle Books from the library for FREE!"
1,Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience.
1,"I'm really enjoying this little tablet. I wat h Amazon Prime movies on it. I shop, check NFL scores and make dining reservations as well as keep up with news and personal email. It's just great.!"
1,I think this is a good tablet. I will order more. It loads the games quickly.
1,My first experience with a streaming device it has been very easy to learn how to use
1,This has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. I was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. I like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.
1,"Smart, timely, very effective around the house. I have a Dot as well but the Tap has MUCH better sound. I had a Google Earth and replaced it with the TAP because Google was not as smart as Tappy!"
1,This is by far the best streaming device I've ever owned!
1,"Love the Echo. So convenient and fun. Get answers to lots of questions, listen to music, books, sleeping sounds, etc. Purchased one for BR and LR since they are so far apart and love the quality of the speakers. Even purchased a dot for kitchen for cooking tips, recipes, and timers plus more."
1,"If you dont need the voice activation of Alexa, or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you, consider the Tap. Almost all of the functionality of Alexa, but in a smaller ( and less expensive ) version.Great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives."
1,This was a gift for my 7 year old grandson. He loved it. It's easy for him to use and the parental controls were perfect to keep him away from inappropriate content. Hours of entertainment for traveling. Great for games and movies for some quiet down time.
1,"Light weight, easy to use, love the lighted background. I am unable to make it stay on page count it keeps going back to hours left to read. But other then that a great ereader."
1,The fire tablet is awesome. I thoroughly enjoy the tablet. Everyone should have this item.
1,"This Echo device is so handy. You can also program it to turn lights on and off in the house if you buy the extra accessories for it. You can play music, order take out , ask it questions. It is really endless what you can do with it."
1,It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.
1,So far we like this. We've not really had a lot of luck with linking to both of our phones. I really like the grocery shopping and to do list features. VERY helpful. I'm sure there is a lot more it will do that we will figure out in time.
1,It's like talking to siri but getting an answer. Real easy to set up and much better with amazon prime.
1,This item is so great. I love it. I bought 2 of this before and gave it to my family member and they loved it too.
1,"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
1,she loves it. very good product for the money. would recommend it to friends.
1,price is right easy to read books onlots of apps available
1,"The Amazon Echo is awesome. It is VERY easy to set up. I mostly play pandora music, but it works with Amazon music and Audible."
1,"The Kindle I currently have is pretty nice. I did however have to send my first one back as it stopped working after 17 days. Awesomely though, Best Buy shipped me a new one free of charge even though it was past the 15 day return policy."
1,I have three amazon products this as well as a kindle and fire stick. This fire TV has the advantage because of the ethernet port. Offers Fox Go for the Yankees but still no TWC compatibility which is why it gets 4 stars out of 5.
1,Don't expect top of the line performance from this 50 dollar unit but it has really nice picture ok sound and good battery life. Shortcomings would be small memory causing laggy performance at times unless you keep your storage amount low on the built in memory.
0,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all..."
1,Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it
1,This is my second echo that I've purchased and I love this thing. I use it for my garage when working in it and I can just yell out what I want to listen to. With xm radio integration it is even better.
1,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"
1,At an affordable rate. I am thrilled with the purchase fir my son
1,Amazon-Fire was instrumental in providing us a quality HD picture to our TV!
0,"everything started out great, but then about 9 days into owning the fire, could not locate wifi, doesn't work without wifi"
0,"Not as easy as it sounded like it was going to be. So many things to buy to get full use out of what we knew we COULD do. Every question we seem to ask Alexa/she says she doesn't know the answer and that we'd have to ""download the app"" - so we never use her/only to ask her to set a timer and tell us the time and ask her to play music, which we also had to set up first. Not as neat as we thought she was going to be."
1,I really like the large screen. Excellent graphics
1,They run way faster then the sticks but I have both
1,My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it
1,Amazon does it again with a great product. Pushes 4K seemlessly and am very satisfied with the product
1,The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn't stand up - hate it
1,Bought for my wife. She loves it. Reads it in bed and the light adjusts accordingly
1,I chose the Alexa with the better speaker and sound since it will be used to listen to mucic. Can browse a multitude of stations and various styles of music.
0,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
1,I purchased the ECHO so I wouldn't have to Google as much. It does have limits on certain info. but my grandson enjoys the games and quizzies.
1,"This is perfect for my needs. I love reading, and can do it in low light situations now. This Paperwhite replaces one I lost in Europe on my last trip. Can't be without one."
1,"Most people buy this for use with Amazon Prime, but that isn't absolutely necessary as there are many other useful apps that are available."
1,Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
1,Works well for the purpose of reading and a few games.
1,Easy set up-great deal for the price! Perfect gift
1,Any time any thing just ask...and she's getting smarter everyday
1,Fun and easy to use. Must be very specfic when asking questions. Music not as good as music played on Sirius. Has good sound and can hear you speak from across the room. I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
1,Greater. Good. Ok. Nice. Ok. Enough. Done. Go get it.
1,"I got this tablet to replace my kindle e-reader. I was not disappointed, it's a great tablet to read books and comic books on. Browsing the internet is ok on it, if that is what you want to do also. Basic games work great, but if you want to play extensive 3D games, you might want to get a different tablet, you can't expect a $50 tablet to run any of those. Overall, it's a great tablet for what I wanted it for."
1,This replaced my 5 year old keyboard unit which died after hitting the floor. I expect this will be every bit as good. Kindle is my favorite reader.
1,The tablet is good for the price is really being sold
1,Great little tablet perfect for reading books and listen music
1,Easy to use and has many options. Like how it can be utilized on two different units.
0,Was tired of getting ripped off by Greenlight cable so decided to do something about it.No monthly charge or late fees for movies.
1,"Love the Echo!! Wonderful speaker... Great news briefs feature. Adding the music unlimited plan really adds quite a bit to this product. Its even great to listen to any radio station that is based virtually anywhere. AM stations never sounded better! :-) Hooking it up to the Nest and Phillips Hue lights increases functionality. We just bought the remote for the bedroom, which is proving very useful as well!"
1,I use one of these in every room of my house with a TV. No more cable bills and I get to watch what I want when I want.
1,"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
1,Bought for my 8 yr old. They absolutely love it. Clear display and durable
1,I have the Echo and I just love it... I bought the Tap for my daughter for Christmas so she does not know she has it yet.
1,Great bang for your buck. Can also be used for all ages.
1,My Alexa is the best buy I bought for Christmas . I purchased the Alexa and the Echo.
0,"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need."
1,"Trs heureux que les livres soient sur Icloud. Aprs m'tre fait voler, c'est bien de pouvoir retrouver tous mes livres avec toutes les notes que j'avais prises."
1,its great for children not costly good for daily use
1,I love it my baby really enjoy it she love it I want to order more
1,"Got these on Black Friday for $35 each, can't NOT pick them up at that price. Perfect for Youtube, Netflix and most mobile games."
1,I love my Amazon Fire tablet. It's easy to use and just the right size to travel with !
1,Great gift for mom. She loves to read and now can continue to do so in more places
1,Bought 2 of these and love them! First 1 was for me. 2nd one was for my daughter. Very slick interface and allows for super fast streaming. Easy to setup and easy to use. Probably will buy the gaming controller for both of them next.
1,I absolutely love this device. Makes my life so much easier.
1,This Echo worls well with my Velop wifi system. I plan to use it with automated home smart appliances. Over all it has worked great so far!!!
1,It basically makes any old TV a smart tv. It is also 4K UHD. That is one of the biggest pluses on top of me having Amazon Prime already.
1,I was hisitating to buy to initially but after started using stated liking it .i would recommend for the same . Great experience
1,Granddaughters really enjoy their gifts. It was reported the house is quite because of increased reading and game playing. Taking trips in the car is quite and pleasant.
1,We have enjoyed this product especially during the holidays.
1,"The Echo can help in so many ways. We use it for music,shopping list and kitchen timer just to name a few of the many things we use it for."
1,The amazon fire i bought for christmas works great.
1,"For the price , you can't go wrong. More than you'd expect from a tablet at this price"
1,"I love the ability to pick and choose magazines, books and more at my leisure. Also love being a prime member and getting a free new book each month as well as 1000s of other selections from Kindle Unlimited! LOVE!"
1,Brought for all 3 of my kids. Love this product. Tablets are easy to operate and have not had any issues with them. Well worth the $40!
1,"This is not a top level tablet, but it was not designed to be one. It is nice to have a toss in the car/backpack/etc. one that performs reasonably well and you don't have to worry about it"
1,"Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!"
1,"Turns on and off fans, lights, water sprinklers, changes thermostat temperature and entertains."
1,"Love it! Lightweight, great for outdoor reading, for travel and all around reading."
1,I've only had to charge my Kindle one time so far. It works well.
1,affordable great for on the go and everyday usages
1,"Love this e-reader! Lightweight, easy to read screen even in very bright conditions. Very easy to check out and return library books without ever going to the library. Would recommend this product to anyone"
1,I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price
1,Wonderful product-couldn't do without it-thoroughly enjoy It-if you are a PRIME member you get to watch TV shows and movies through prime free.
1,Only got four stars because it's got to many preloaded apps I can not hide and I got this tab for my seven year old for Christmas. She loves it though and it works great.
1,"best streaming device for the money,not very happy with the changes from amazon on blocking some apps.May change to a different device"
1,A bit complicated the process of loading Books bought in different stores to Amazon. It should be more user friendly for new users (we do not come from amazon)
1,I love this product. Streams almost everything with no problem at all.
1,I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
1,"I've purchased other kids tablets, but this is the best. It's user friendly and interactive. My grandson carries it with him where ever he goes."
1,"works great in bright sunlight, used it at the beach"
1,Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.
0,this is great for the price. It is slow on certain application.
1,Works better than roku plus apps like psvue were developed with more love. Roku also had some strange problem with working on a tv that requires hdmi to dvi
1,"I bought four of these for Christmas gifts. Everyone really seems to enjoy them. I didn't realize that I could put the games I bought on amazon on all of them, bonus!"
1,"Responds very well and understands you, and this one has great sound as well, unlike the dot."
1,"Battery life is excellent. I like the backlight and found the screen easy to read, although it isn't quite as much like paper as some of the other reviews I read make it seem."
1,Love the ease of use. Can listen to music and make shopping lists that go directly to my phone. Discovering new uses everyday.
1,This fire Tv is a great product and it met my expectations.
1,Bought 2 and gave one as a birthday gift. Wow...reaction was fabulous..like...best gift almost ever. I love this new toy.
1,It was not too expensive and it is very useful for our Daycare
1,"Theses kindle fires ate great for everyone. They are easy to use; have lots of features and are prefect for reading, playing games, getting organized and having fun. My kids use these all the time to do homework on, read books, watch movies and play games. I love that they have decreased the price and are easy for kids to use."
1,Easy to hold & read with no strain to eyes. Love that I can highlight text.
1,A very good tablet with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.
1,My daughter loves her new tablet. Plenty of games and videos to watch
0,I only bought this as a travel companion when I fly. It was cheap and functional.
1,The paper white is a great kindle that easy to handle and use. Bright screen is perfect for sunlight
1,it's a bit small but it has a nice amount of space
1,"Very nice gadget for Kindle users. The 7"" display is apt for reading"
1,Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
1,Just right for my mom. Got it and put prime on it for her and Netflix along with some games. I think she likes it.
1,It's everything I needed in a reader. The light is perfectly balanced and the text is so easy on the eyes and brain to read. Couldn't be happier.
1,"It's a great delivery vehicle for all your Amazon video and music needs. I bought it to watch PlayStation Vue (no more expensive Time Warner Cable for me!) It's built on Android OS so you can install Andriod apps. What I love about this box is that I can load my old school NES and SNES emulators and play them with the Bluetooth controller. You can also set up Kodi on it and you've got all kinds of movie, TV, music and gaming options using it. With micro SD card support and an extra USB port, this device is so much better than the TV Stick, and it's a lot speedier. Highly recommended!"
1,It does the job required. It is easy to set up and use.
1,Love this product. Glad I upgraded! The features make it easy to read while traveling by car or plane.
1,"This table is small enough for my purse, and handy enough for what i need."
1,"Let's be honest, I didn't think I would be really satisfied with a $50 tablet. But I thought this would be good enough for web browsing, email and the occasional YouTube or Netflix video so I bought it. This tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. This Kindle Fire is better than the one I paid $200 for a couple of years ago (and comparable performance to my iPad3). It is more responsive and has an expandable microSD slot for more memory. The only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras (only adequate for Skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons (on top...would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device). However, I liked this so much that I'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!"
1,well design and perfect size to carry along. What it does is to give you a quick access to e book and provide a better experience compared to view of phones
1,I would recommend the echo to anyone who is looking for a smart home device.
1,Amazon fire TV was easy to install and the content is great..
1,"I've had no problems so far, pretty good tablet for the price."
1,"My girlfriend has been using an iPad for several years. She decided she wanted to try the Kindle because I liked mine so much, so I got one for her for Christmas. Now she is hooked. (Anyone want to buy an iPad?)"
1,its for a gift
1,"Never thought I would like this, but my wife gave me one for Christmas, and I love it. It is very easy to use and fun."
1,Great Christmas gift for a young adult. She loved it
1,"Well worth the investment. Picture quality is on par with Verizon FiOS. Purchased 2 units. One used wirelessly the other via LAN connection. Without a loop, picture quality very similar. Highly recommended."
1,Purchased it for the wife she said it's easy to read in any light and she loves it.
1,Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.
1,I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
1,This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely.
1,Nice reader and my eyes feel better. I also can read at night.
1,My mom loves this More space and functions very well!
1,I love the touch screen aspect still love the original.
1,EXCELLENT PRODUCT THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY ARE GOOD

1,less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!
1,I really enjoy having Alexa. To help with daily chores and keep us organized
1,"I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly."
1,This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!
1,Have had no problems with the unit. Works as advertised.
1,I bought this tablet for my son. It was reasonably priced and he loves it. Easy to carry around. He loves reading books on it
1,Ideal for convenient music playback when walking in at the end of the day.
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect besides music, and this echo does SO much more! We can check the weather, it tells jokes, and is all around just fun to have!"
1,"Very convenient and far from costly. It brings sufficient compatibility, and then some. In other words, I'm completely satisfied."
1,A great way to make the web easier to use. Love it!
1,I like the size of this kindle and easy access to internet.
1,This gadget is amazing - you can watch movies from 1958 if you are into that era.
1,Very fast and interface is cery user friendly a+ rating
1,This tablet is great for games and books. Good size for travel.
1,My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.
1,I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it.

1,She likes it but it started freezing up. It's fun to her.
1,The was an excellent Christmas gift for my son. It does everything he needs.

1,Small and light enough to put in a handbag to keep with you all the time
1,Lost' my original Kindle...This was the replacement!
1,The fire stick makes great gifts for family and friends and especially college students.
1,Space saving device and energy saver. Feel like a king commanding for information and ease of use - my music streams well and quality of sound is great coverage over 2000 square feet perimeter. Must buy product!
1,"My nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works"
1,amazing good quality great sound incredible range love it
1,I bought this for my grandma and she absolutely loves it! Very easy for her to figure things out and she is not tech savvy by any means! She loves reading books and getting on her Facebook so this was perfect for her!
1,It's so convenient to ask Alexa anything with out having to get up.
1,Upgraded my kindle. I wanted to have the internal light for the screen. The purple kindle cover fits perfectly and ensures for safe transportation. I was able to easily upload all my books from my older kindle to re-read. Now I can enjoy my kindle at night without bothering anyone with the lights on!!
1,This tablet is just the right size for travel and the kids.It has the Amazon app store and user interface and lots ofgreat features. Auto uploads pictures and videos to your Amazon cloud.
1,It works for what I use it for which is PlayStation vue. My only complaint is that the remote could be better quality.
1,"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading."
1,"The Echo is an amazing gadget. It answers questions faster than I could look up the answer online. It is a great alarm clock. It is fun to ask Echo opinion questions, because it often has a great come back answer. It sings, tells jokes, and has one funny bedtime story. It does all this and I have just started learning all it can do."
1,I purchased this gift for a family who didn't have much and I wanted to bless their kids with something nice. This made their day and was exactly what they wanted. I purchased two of them originally but now I might buy two more.
1,I bought two kindle fires for my kids and I am thinking about purchasing a third one. I love the micro SD slot and the response of it is great. We have owned them for almost a month now nd is flawless. You can't beat the price anywhere.
1,Good tablet for the price! Quality brand and service
1,I really like the product. I signed up for Aamazon prime. Now I can listen to lots of great music.
1,This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button
1,The person I gave it to for Christmas is really enjoying it alot .
1,Having some problems with our Echo. Does not hold the internet connection. Other devices on the wifi are fine.
1,Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.
1,Size is a little small and hard to type because characters are close together. Charge cord is positional so it is difficult to play with it while charging and cord is very short.The price is very good and it works well. I like the Amazon store and added benefit of Amazon coins
1,I was skeptical at first but I love love love it!!!
1,My 2nd kindle so it meets my expectations better than my very old one.
1,Already purchased fire stick but wanted a box with a little more capability. The android boxes were priced over $200. This box is dual wifi band plus has ethernet. Runs great with no issues. Would recommend
1,Lots of useful apps and options that give access to anything you could possibly want to watch.
1,I haven't found anything I don't like about this! It is just what I was looking for!
1,Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
1,I enjoy using my kindle. It is lightweight and I can just take it out and read while waiting for the bus or at any time. The Kindle is easy to use and easy on the eyes and it is perfect when reading outdoors.
1,Excellent product. I would definitely recommend the Kindle for anyone who likes to read
1,Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
1,What a deal I got this Black Friday specially for a kid who loves reading
1,"Easy to use for any age, would recommend to anyone"
1,Does a great job allowing me to watch shows i want to watch
1,This device is an integral part of having a smart home.
1,I already have a kinds. I bought this as a gift. Love best buy online customer servive!
1,What a cool speaker. Alexa is fun to use and the sound is great.
0,Ok for a kid tablet the size is good you can okly use there apps
1,We have this for a gift so do not have any feedback yet
1,My kids enjoy their tablets. They really enjoy the games the can download on it.
1,Safe buy bought on Black Friday for 35 bucks super happy
1,I like this thing I have it turning on lights in and out of the house it good for getting info about things it can do math it can hear very good and will play music from my Pandora account that's just a few things it can do.
1,"My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands."
1,"A friend recommended I buy one. He paid $50 for his. When I saw it on sale at Best Buy for $39 I snagged one, I wish I understood the features better. I mostly use it for reading before bed. It's my first time doing so on a Kindle. Was surprised to like it so much! I live in a small trailer. It is great to an electronic library."
1,Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
1,"The way Amazon has set up their software is pretty great, they make it easy to get connected to your hulu, hbogo, netflix or whatever streaming service you have. Plus if you are a prime member you are already loaded with streaming content straight from the box, I have two Fire tvs and three firesticks, wouldn't change them for anything."
1,Bought this for a 6 year old to use. She still uses it and so far there has been no problems with it. She uses it a lot
1,I thinj its a but overpriced. If i knew better would have opted for the flash
1,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
0,Good productThe only thing I don't like is that the remote is unresponsive some times. All in all good steaming device.
1,"This is a great little tablet for under $50. It's good for surfing websites, social media, watching videos and checking emails. I prefer to use a laptop for more complex tasks. It came with Web Root which was easy to download for virus protection."
1,"It is easy to set up, efficient in voice commands and entertaining."
0,"I picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy. I have a few family members that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them. The new product I got was very disappointing, The display had a dead pixel on it when I turned it on. The product is very slow and the cameras leave a lot to be desired. I took it back and exchanged for an IPad Mini 4 and am very happy with it."
1,"First of all I'm amazed I could buy it from Best Buy, while Amazon says it will be in stock on December 1st (in more than a month from now). Best Buy is indeed the best!The Voyage itself is simply fantastic. The size is right, it's very lightweigh, quite zippy, text is super crisp, and I love the auto-brightness feature."
1,Reliable and well-regulated for dual voltage (110-120v and 220-240v) without too much heat generation in Europe/Asia.
1,Very pleased.i purchased echo dot but not really happy with speaker. So far very ok
1,I absolutely love my Echo! I have Alexa play my favorite must while I'm home. She keeps me informed and helps me remember things that pop into my head as I'm working around the house. I look forward to trying new skills when I discover them. Love this product!
1,"It is exactly what I wanted, I can recommend this article to my friends"
1,I use this everyday. My entire family enjoys using apps.
1,"This tablet is great for my son. It's easy for him to access and download apps, play music and enjoy video racing games. Great value for the price!!!"
1,So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!
1,"I purchased the echo just to see what all the talk was about. I found that it works well and really makes life easier. I get my wake up alert, music, and news with ease. My mornings run so smooth and easy."
1,"Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet."
1,my son loves it he's been on it all day he loves all the apps he can get
1,It is very simple to set up on your tv we were going to run a cable to the other tv in the bedroom but it was less money to purchase the fire stick
1,"It gets time to get used to it and sometimes it misunderstands the commands, but overall it is really awesome and a great experience!!"
1,Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for
1,We have bought many kindle before and they always work put great for us and the kids can use them easily. I love that I can set the kids profile so they can't make purchases I just wish you could set them to stay in the child's profile until an adult takes it out.
1,"Don't bother wasting the extra money on the official Amazon Kids Fire Tablet, we got this with a nice case and 32 GB SD card (both of those from Amazon) for cheaper than the bundle price from Amazon directly."
1,I got this to complete my home automation. and I use it to listen to radio and music. wish it is a bit cheaper.
0,"I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product."
1,"This is a great entry-level tablet for the casual user looking for simple web browsing, email access, and low resolution media such as ebooks, streaming movies, and games. The hardware feels sturdy in your hand and the display boasts a scratch resistant surface as opposed to less durable products found in this price range. It isn't lightening fast but loads and runs most apps quickly and smoothly."
1,"This is by far one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I'm enjoying all the different forms of music available by just asking ""Alexa""."
1,Fantastic option for those fed up expensive unnecessary cable and satellite services.
1,A great gift for a 65 year old aunt! She uses it everyday!
1,This sub charger gives a quicker charge for our kindles than the other Amazon and apple chargers that we have.
1,It's neat to use. Something I never thought I'd have. At the price I couldn't pass it up.
0,"This is clearly taking advantaged of Kindle customers who lack a technical understanding of what it is. Go to Amazon and search: AC USB Chargers, many listings starting at two for 7.99."
1,My echo is outstanding plays my music with clear sounds in it hears my voice five feet away
1,This is a great set top box with plenty of apps that will keep anyone engaged for hours!
1,My wife has a regular tablet but screen is not good for outside reading at the beach or pool. Got her theKindle Paperwhite and she is thrilled. Great purchase!
1,"Purchased for mother in law as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She had a version 1 and she loved. She loves the better sound, picture and speed of the newer version."
1,"Quick and easy setup impressed me. I bought this as a gift for my mom. Within 3 minutes she had the device registered, connected to her WiFi and downloading her Amazon book collection. Seeing the device made me want one for myself!"
1,Love the reading on my kindle. The camera is great.
1,Great product. Would be nice to have the Xfinity go app and vudu.
1,just getting this kindle figured out. so far I like what I see.
1,Got this tablet during the Holidays while on sale. Take it to work not so worried about it being stolen. And screen is tuff as heck.
1,Great low priced tablet. Got it on sale and it does exactly what I need it too.
1,This tablet is a good started tablet for children.
1,"Nice size to work with, not too big or too small to carry with you"
1,"I have been thinking about getting an Echo for my family room. I am glad I did. We listen to music, the news, etc. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you will get even more out of it. I love it when my Grandson comes over. I play lullabies to put him to sleep. I can't wait to try some of the other features!"
1,"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
1,Have been using this kindle paperwhite and it's a lot lot better from reading in tablets. Not eye stressing and really very handy. Nice product!
1,Fire tv is great no problems at all the best purchase I've made this year
0,"I had two of these in less than a year, it's definitely good for the price. The problem is that the charger port breaks very often. No matter how gentle toy are, it deteriorates within a couple months."
1,It is perfect for everything I need to be able to do on the go.
1,"I bought the Echo and a few Hue light bulbs when the radio that I use to listen to NPR new in the morning died on me. I've been very happy. I didn't even have to set it up to find my radio station! I just said, ""Alexa, listen to 88.9 FM,"" and she did it. Just like that. My kids ask her to check their math problems for their homework. We use her to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning. The lighting set up was super easy. Alexa is a nice addition to our family."
1,"Excellent product. Can get some apps that the fire stick and Roku 3 can not. Of course this is a small screen but offers more flexibility than just streaming. Its a computer, kindle and mobile device all in one."
1,"I bought this product at Best Buy instead of online, as I wanted to get in the day I wanted it. Just the voice activated programing is worth it alone, and the quality of the sound. I was using my phone for music, and it was not the best quality and the battery would run out.This is a great product as it solves both of those issues and more!"
1,We got two of these tablets for my twins for Christmas and they are great. Using the parental controls plus the durability you cant beat the price. Also there have been not one issue with the tablet. Great inexpensive tablet for kids or anyone.
1,Bought this for my Dad in a senior living facility. He loves it and uses it daily to answer questions and listen to music.
1,We use our Echo daily from researching items to playing our favorite music. It has become very handy in our household.
1,I brought the fire tv to get rid of cable. I'm able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows.
1,I originally purchased the Google Home as a gift for my husband. He quickly was frustrated with Google Home as it didn't respond to what he was as asking. The Echo is much better equipped to answer questions and follow commands than its competitors.
1,"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done."
1,Like the fire but disappointed that they were selling a device that is a model that is two years old.
1,If you want a virtual assistant Echo is the way to go. Amazon was very smart and making it so you can add on additional pieces for a very low cost. Pairs great with Amazon Prime account.
1,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.
1,My daughter absolutely loves this! It is very user friendly. My only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.
1,"I'm still learning. So far we are enjoying music, setting timers, and setting appointment reminders. Will soon be making my grocery list and watching movies. I really need to read up on all she can do."
1,Well done Amazon - easy to set up and use - well made product.
1,I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
1,when you turn on fire box it opens/runs movies fast.
0,"Without the lights, thermostat or alarm that you would attach to the echo doesn't seem like a practical thing. If you plan on having the other items to connect then it would probably be a better device for you. Again, solid device I just don't have use for it daily."
1,Really impressed with what this tablet is capable of doing for price. At only 49 dollars it is pretty snappy accessing the internet and playing videos are sharp and clear. Most of the apps I need to use are available and free. It seems to run similar to Android tablets which should be easy for someone familiar with how android operates. This might be for kids to use but it fits with what I need to use.
1,"I decided to get a Kindle because I was having issues reading on my backlit tablet. The screen lighting on the paper white doesn't have this issue. I also like the lack of distractions, I don't have e-mails or texts popping up while I'm trying to read."
0,I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.
0,Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it
1,"This is the 3rd Kindle Fire I have bought. This one was a present for my nephew. I love the Fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. Amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as Apple. I actually have an iPad too but would rather play on my Fire tablet. I have used my Fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch TV shows and movies for free as I have Amazon Prime."
1,Love to use it everyday. Inside light is useful at night
1,Just as advertised. Stunning bright white HD font. It's easier to read than an actual book. My eyes do not get fatigued.
1,"For the cost, this is a best buy, if you are tech savvy there are multiple things to come from these tablets. Android is available just have to know how to get it."
1,I would say this tablet is a killer deal for the price. I bought it for my 2 year old who loves to watch Mickey Mouse and just random baby songs. Works perfect. Best thing about it is....... If they break it... it wont cost you much to replace it. I bought 2 of them just incase.
1,"My girlfriend and I have essentially become cord cutters so we had to find a box top set so that we could watch our Netflix, Directtv, and HBO. We got this because it was recommended by a friend. The user interface is simple and it works great if you have Amazon Prime. The main issue we have is when we forget to put it to sleep, which i recommend you do, is that the apps stall and don't start up right away. I'm not sure if it's the apps or the Fire TV itself. Its bothersome at times but it's nothing that we have to get replaced."
1,"Bought this kindle for my grandson as a birthday present, he is excited about it. Could not believe the price."
1,"Happy with purchase, would recommend to other people"
0,Good inexpensive tablet. I use it to control my E series vizio and andriod box. Apps open slower than on my Galaxy S7 edge but other than that everyting works as expected. Note that google play store is not available without modification
1,This product is much better than the fire stick I wish it came with a HDMI cable though
1,I am very happy with my fire tv. It's makes me want to buy another to go in my son's room.
1,Nice to just check emailAnd read books. I would recomend
1,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, works good. Only downfall is no Google play only amazon apps."
1,This product's reaction time between apps is what sold me. No lag like other devices. 4k streaming looks awesome!!
0,Good gift for basic Internet use browsing emails .
0,It's a pretty good device but still has some issues with voice recognition
0,"I bought two of these for my kids, They've destroyed ipads and this was a low cost replacement. Great price still not an ipad substitute"
1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it and stays on it.
1,The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
1,"My Nephew wanted a tablet for Christmas so I decided to try him with this one since he's only 10, he loves it. This is really a great gift for someone."
1,My son had the same Model kindle but a year later his kindle had issues. This kindle has a micro sd slot for storage. I haven't tested it out yet. I plan on testing it out to see if I can load movies on the micro sd
1,This Amazon Echo complements the other home automation products I currently have. It works great with my Wemo lights and my Nest thermostats. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to automate their home.
1,The weight and inches of the tablet is convenient for traveling
1,"This is the best tablet ever! Great price and quality! I definitely recommend everyone to get this tablet if you travel a lot or just for use casually around the house. At 49.99 price point, you can't beat that!"
0,Didn't think it is well made the product ask for too many sign up
1,Bought this to use in my business. Economically priced and a whole lot cheaper than an iPad and does the same thing.
1,i was not expecting how great this product is. It was really easy to use and install.
1,Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access
1,The ease of Alexa in performing functions is second to none. SIRI who?
1,"I purchased a Kindle for my 8 year old son and he loves it!. As long as the wi-fi is working properly, he is able to stream videos perfectly. There is also an option through Amazon that allows the user to download videos to play later. Downloading and playing games is very easy unlike a ""child"" tablet I purchased for him previously. The only negative I would give the Kindle is it may not always have the games/apps that ITunes and Google have but I have not heard any complaints for him! Well worth the money!"
1,Does everything I need in a box tie it in with Amazon prime and its all you need
1,got as a gift. Might not have got for my self- but love it and glad I had a birthday - lol
1,The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.
1,"I have two echo dots and two other echoes and I love them! It's convenient, looks great and sounds great. Got my last two echoes for a great price!"
1,"Love this,got it jail broken so I can watch anything I want"
1,My kids love their new tablet Easy to use for them and myself
1,This is a nice tablet for its price and size. Thanks!
1,"I'm really enjoying my Echo. There are so many things it can do. You can create a shopping list, ask for the weather, play music, just to name a few. The sound quality is pretty good also."
1,Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
1,"I recently decided to be a cord cutter and not have cable anymore, just internet. I currently have a Samsung 60"" Smart 4K UHD and the Samsung 4K Blu-Ray player and a PC that I use to access all my online content.I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV and discovered that I already have access to just about everything the Amazon Fire TV has through mny TV, Blu-ray player and PC.This is a great device but for me it was just redundant."
1,"I like how easy it is to do what i need on this tablet, like downloading apps,playing games, streaming on netflix and taking pictures."
1,I bought it to help with cutting the cord. I use it mostly to access PlayStation vue service and it works great. If i were a amazon prime member i imagine it would be great to access the prime content. The fire box allows for direct wire to the modem and loads faster than the fire stick which is wifi only.
1,I have only used it one time to download an e-book. It works exactly as it was supposed to work. Just wish it came with the kindle rather than having to purchase seperately.
1,"My kids already broke two of my tablets. So, I want one specifically for my kids. This Amazon Fire 7 fits my needs. I'm happy with my purchase."
1,"My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made ."
1,"I use it mainly for streaming music and it is easy to connect to Pandora, iHeart, and my music library. I would like it to connect to my garage door opener and stream to other speakers in the house."
1,"It was very simple to open, put together, install and begin watching my favorite shows. I highly recommend this box."
1,This is a great tablet for the beginner. Very light weight and easy to use.
1,"Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use."
1,Having a good time learning all of Alexa functions.
1,"It's a great speaker for the kids and the whole family, I love it especially the games it plays on family night"
1,"I am pleased with unit, I was surprised that it does not pair with external speakers, but other than that, good product."
1,"Love it. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Just the right size to hold in one hand and ""turn"" pages with the other."
1,Absolutely love my new Kindle Voyager. Lightweight and compact size makes it easier to carry with me everywhere I go. Wish I had bought one sooner.
1,"This is an excellent tablet to have if you aren't looking to spend too much. Doesn't have tons of features, however, it has the main basics: music, web browsing, email, video/movies, gaming, and reading. Plus, if your an Amazon Prime member, you can get great games for free like Real Racing 3, and DuckTales. Also, great as a young child's tablet."
1,We like this tablet and the fact it is easy on the eyes for reading.
1,EXCELLENT PRODUCT IT SAVES YOU MONEY ON WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS AND SPORTS AND MOVIES .
1,Purchased 6 of these tables for Christmas presents and was extremely surprised with how well they work for the price. The Amazon environment takes a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price.
1,It works well for my daughter no complaints works well
1,This tablet has been great so far. We use it a good bit in the car as well.
0,This product not good waste of money I would recommend it
1,Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
1,"This a nice little tablet although I only have used it very little. I bought it for a backup, because we all know sooner or later ones going to break down. For the price you can't beat it. Next year I may buy more than one."
1,"Serves my needs ,just need for quick Internet surfing,email,ect."
1,Is great for beginners I love the parental control on it it works great for my toddler.
1,Purchased this at a great price to use as an on the go tablet. Works great and is easy to use.
1,"Bought this for a Christmas Gift, the item is great"
1,Best hands free speaker for a beginner. My daughter loves it.
0,Expected it to be a bigger version of the HDX but it was not. The email was bad and so was the calendar.
1,Love it... quality is great. Love your interactive it is..
1,This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
1,I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
1,"We are enjoying Alexa for her flash briefing of the news, music on demand, calendar review, and shopping lists. We have not even begun to touch on what Alexa can do. Can't wait to learn more."
1,I have one and like it so much that I purchased one for my son. It can be used for entertainment or to control a smart home.
0,The Kindle I purchased is a good and expensive tablet useful for reading and internet. It does have a lot of apps already loaded that I do not plan to use and do not know how to delete. I mainly use the Kindle Fire for Facebook and occasionally get on the internet.
1,After using the Amazon Fire Stick for about 6 months I decided to upgrade to the Fire TV and it is so much faster and I can hardwire it directly into my network unlike the fire stick which is only wireless.
0,Kindle is nice for road trips to watch movies. Good battery life. It's cool.
1,"Purchased for my god son and he loves it! Wish I could have found a cover for it at BB as well, but was able to eventually get one."
1,"So, I won't be able to go into super depth for this. I only needed a device to run one app. For my purposes, it literally has one job.I can say, for the price, it's far more responsive that I would have ever guessed. And the screen clarity is great. Good battery life.I was disappointed that the lock screen would always show ads. I don't have the package, and I don't recall it being forward with this fact. In the settings, I said I had to pay $15 to disable ads because ""in exchange for the subsidized price, they can do ads"" or something like that.I kinda get that, and for most people this may not be a big deal. But for my reasons, this is a bit unprofessional to have. So when buying it, whatever the price, you may have to shell out $15 more.Still, all said and done, good price for simple needs."
1,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess."
1,Bought this to activate playstation vue and have had good luck with it so far.
1,The screen resolution isn't the best but it's great for the price. Does everything you need from a tablet. Some components like cameras aren't great but all in all its one darn good tablet
1,"If you have an Amazon Prime membership, so that you are getting all of the videos and music, then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go. It;s not the highest end, but works great with the Amazon features for a great price"
1,I love the fact that I can expand the memory. The image is much better and faster than the stick
1,This tablet is better than you think you'd get for the price. Decent design and it's faster than most tablets in this price range. Not a fan of Amazon's Fire OS and wish it had Android but most of the apps are available so it's not a major issue. Overall great buy!
1,This echo is an addition to others we have in home. We are currently trying to get one out in every room. The sound quality is right there with any nose system
1,I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
0,"The Echo is ok, it's a decent speaker and I like that it has a Bluetooth so I can listen to music off my phone.But there is more that I don't like then I like.For example, to play music off spottily you must have a perineum account ($10 a month).I heart radio will play only the last station it had on, not sure yet but can't change station with just voice.Most of ""skills"" are done poorly, for example my Honeywell thermostat, you can't ask it to tell you the temp, turn on, turn off.Only thing that can be done, is to ask it to raise or drop the temperature.At this time it will not control my wifi sprinkler system ""orbit Bhyve"".You don't always get an answer to questions as it uses Bing as a search engine, which I'm not a big fan of .Tried to buy wifi light switches so I can have it controlling that, but after purchasing the Wemo switch I found out that all the switches in my house are 2 way switches, so that did not work.So basically it's just ok, and maybe in few years it will be better, but over all like I said there is more that I don't like about it."
1,Alexa does a great job playing music and adding items to my shopping list. I have not used very many of the skills but I think this item has great potential to continue to improve.
1,This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.
1,"It is fun to talk to Alexa from time to time. Once you teach her some skills, she can do a wide variety of things. We love playing music with her and making lists for groceries."
1,Bought the tablet for my young nephews and they love it. This tablet is user friendly.
1,I looked all over for a tablet and Best Buy had only two left so I knew it was meant to be.
1,The tablets are cheap and can do alot I've bought many cheap tablets before that weren't good
1,"alexa is everything we expected it to be, use it daily"
1,I purchased this to have a smaller footprint tablet. Could use more popular apps but still great for keeping the library at the tip of the fingers and a camera to boot.
1,Bought this for a relative at christmas...I was hooked...plays any song I can think of..does math..reads Bible...orders pizza..and turns on lights..I have it connected to my nest thermostat..great gadget that works for you
1,"Thr fire is a great gadget for almost any occasion or circumstance, gathering info. or just relaxing."
1,I was looking for an easy and functional tablet for my parents for Christmas. They are learning how to use it.
1,Love it my kids love it nice to travel with nice pictures
1,"This is a great tablet for my 5 year old boy. It was inexpensive at $35 on black Friday. I particuly prefer it because, with my Amazon prime account, I can download videos to it. Amazon only let's Amazon products download videos. It was great when we traveled at Christmas. No more dvds and player needed!"
1,I really like this product. Works just as advertised.
1,"You can't go wrong with Alexa, easy to use. I get my flash briefing news with the focus on the Economy as a breeze when I get home after work.No need to turn the TV or a radio for the upcoming Weather, just ask Alexa."
1,I definitely recommend the fire tv vs the fire stick
1,This product is awesome. The echo plays songs and answer questions. I can't wait to add the thermostat and light control modules.
1,What a super product. So very convenient being able to ask questions or give commands rather than firing up the computer and typing.
1,Easy to set up. Sound is clear and works well in a medium size room.
1,Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.
1,I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.
1,"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
1,Bought for my 3 year old so she could be like her older sisters and this little device doesn't disappoint. I wish there were more silicone cases available for it and I absolutely can't stand the ads Amazon puts on these Fire tablets.
1,We check local weather aND enjoy music. We get answears to questions.
1,"If you want a dedicated device for reading books, the Kindle paperwhite is great. Battery lasts for weeks without a charge, screen is easy on the eyes,links to dictionary.com and wikipedia are so helpful!"
1,"Great quality and easy to use! Can't beat the price either. We bought two of these and a little over a month ago and they operate very smoothly. We use them for streaming shows, movies, playing games and surfing the net. I have nothing negative to say about this product."
1,"This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
1,Bought this for my nephew since he dropped his last one in the toilet and we didn't purchase the accidental coverage last time. He is only 8 but loves to play games on it. Since it's linked to my amazon account I can see what games he is downloading and control the purchases made. Definitely a must have for long car rides!
1,Far surpasses my expectations. Would definitely recommend it as a beginner tablet.
1,"The Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great tablet for the money (Got it during Black Friday for $35, but even at $50 is still a good deal). You can get most apps on the Amazon Underground store for free, and most add-ons for the apps are even free, compared to .99 cents each for apple devices. Only drawback for my preference, is that there isn't a facetime app to videochat with other Apple device users with. Other than that, pretty much any other iOS app is available for the Amazon Fire. Videos play very well, not HD quality, but not bad either. This is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet, check emails, facebook, etc, and for the price, it can't be matched by any other tablet on the market."
1,Lady had been looking for one of these since Xmas and found one. And loves it
1,laods up quic k i love the voice remote...awesome product
1,Bought this for my mother who has not used a tablet often and already she loves it and it helps to occupy her time since she has retired.
1,My wife left her Kindle on the plane. We made a quick stop to Best Buy to purchase her another Kindle. She can't live without it!
1,Very pleased with options to watch. Saves big on cable bills
1,We love the amazon fire tv the 4K definition is great easy to use
1,Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
1,Highly recommended to all. Battery is good. A lot of things to do just like any expensive tablet on a cheaper price.
1,This product was a good price. It lets me read the books I want as well as access the internet. Overall a good purchase.
1,"Small, compact and perfect for travel. Able to be read while the sun is shining directly on it."
1,The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!
1,Love it. Its fast..the visual is great. It has plenty of room to download games and books on it. I love the mayday feature on it because its helped is when we got stuck. My 3 year old can use it very easily as can my elderly parent. The processor is fast and that makes doing anything on it
1,Works like a charm and am Bert pleased with my purchase
1,Would recommend it 100%. EASY TO USE GREAT FOR KIDS
1,Great buying experience. Bought online. Shipped and received sooner than expected. I wil Buy from Best Buy again!
1,"I purchased this tablet for my mom for Christmas,and she loves it.She really enjoyed using the Alexa feature.Though I did have to return the first tablet due to some software issues,I had a great customer service experience.There took care of the problem right away,and exchange for a new one. Haven't had any issues with the new replacement tablet.My mom couldn't be happier.The tablet was a wonderful price.Thanks Best Buy"
1,"Love my new paperwhite kindle. Syncs with my older Touch Kindle and if I let one battery run down, can pick up on the other. Love the ability to read my paperwhite in low light areas which could not do with older kindle."
1,I use Alexa daily and love it! Would def recomment
1,"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
1,"Easy setup, fast.Had everything ROKU has plus games."
1,This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better.
1,"This is a gift for my daughter. I have been utilizing it. So far, so good."
0,It started cutting off and on by itself!!! Its like it had a mind of its own!!!
1,Couldn't ask for anything better it's better then apple
1,Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.
1,Purchased on thanksgiving great price for the tablet.
1,"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
1,Very good access to multiple venues. Cheap and easy to use.
1,"Great gifts for grandchildren.. At the per unit price, I'm grandpa of the year."
1,I can read all my books great battery life and games
1,Lots of great features and voice recognition is great!
1,It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
1,I bought this as a Christmas present for my 12 year old niece. She loves it. She is consistently checking her facebook and playing games from all the apps. SHe a loves it.
1,For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.
1,I have bought many of these tablets for family members and had no complaints
1,"I bought this for my kids, 5 and 9. I wanted to get them a tablet but still restrict what they could do. This tablet has fantastic parental controls. I opted to include the FreeTime membership and that puts them into a kid-specific app center where they just click and play without the visible hassle of downloading, fees, and ads. It's been very sturdy with the 5 year old. Overall I am extremely satisfied for a kids tablet. Not sure I would buy one for me personally, but great for kids."
1,At a price that doesn't require a bank loan or cashing in that retirement annuity.
0,"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it"
1,Works just like echo but portable!! Great stuff. As described!
1,I originally bought a regular tablet to read my Ebooks but my tablets battery drained to fast and is kind of cumbersome. On a whim I decided to give the paperwhite a go and I love it. It's glarefree the battery lasts for three weeks and I like being able to highlight a characters name in a novel and get background info on who it is.
1,Nice and lightweight; the screen is easy to read. I don't like that half the screen on the menu page is taken up by promos instead of my library.
1,We are still learning how to use the Echo device but it has lived up to all our expectations. Easy to setup and use.
1,My 2 sons 8 and 10 years old do not want to put them away!!!! A lot of free games. Great price for quality name product.
1,The item works great love it. Would recommend this item to coworkers and family.
1,Nice gift for the grandson. He will get much use of it! It was nice that it was available in different colors so that he could tell his apart from his sister's.Nice size for traveling with.
1,"Nice size. Functions as expected. Use it for reading books, email and a bit of web surfing. Like that you can turn down the screen brightness for night reading. Took off one star because it is tied to the Amazon store for apps and you can't easily edit Google docs & spreadsheets as you can on an Android tablet."
1,Got for my 3 year old and she loves it. Very easy to use and a great price.
1,I brought it to have an extra table around the house for my daughter and it didn't disappoint
1,"My best friend loved this kindle. She loves reading books and she certainly love this Kindle. She can read books anywhere she wants without having to carry her books individually. If you are a book lover, like she is, then you will love this."
1,"Got this for my nephew, he had a galaxy and loves the amazon"
1,It's a must buy for the money you can't beat it at all.
1,EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE IS EXEPTIONAL.THE UNITS IN STOCK AND GRATE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE.
1,I recommend you good product you can buy it at bestbuy in my favorite shop buy it now
1,"Great purchase. Really worth it if you have Netflix, Hulu and stream other things to phase out cable. Easy to use."
1,Great addition to any media center. Easy to use and great picture and sound quality!
1,Haven't had any issues with it and got it on sale pretty cheap.
1,This tablet works wonders great price my grandchildren love it . My granddaughter love downloading books my grandsons enjoy the games.
1,The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices.
1,"It works perfect with all the android apps, fast and never freezes or anything. No problems at all."
1,Extremely easy to use and to purchase. The touch screen works well and the auto on-off is very helpful. Love the ability to just close and system is off and not using battery.
0,This was easy to setup and easy to hand over to my 4 yr old. She loves the different games and apps that are available to her.
1,"Great sound quality, amazing microphone. Very cool experience to come home, tell ""Alexa"" to turn on the lights and play music from spotify. Well worth the price."
1,"I was one of the original Amazon Echo purchasers, and have loved using it ever since. I bought this one as a ""thank you"" gift for my wonderful brother-in-law, who baby-sat me through two cataract surgeries. He loves it too."
1,Great item for a great price. You can't go wrong..
1,"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
1,"This did not fulfil all of my needs, but it is a great starting product"
1,First rate - high quality!
1,Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather
1,I own a Kindle Fire and an iPad and I have a hard time reading them on the beach due to the glare. This Kindle Reader is small enough to fit in your purse to take anywhere to read. Love it!
1,"This is a great streaming box, and I enjoy the voice search option. However, I wish that the Amazon Fire tv when doing a search on the main screen would provide you the options of a movie or tv. show from apps that you have a subscription with and not just Amazon. Of course I can go into each and every app that I have a paid subscription with, but It would be nice to do a search from the main screen and display results across the board."
0,"This item is ok,haven't really used it to the full extent need to learn more and figure out what other benefits it has to offer."
1,This works really well and is very easy to set up and use.
1,"Easy to navigate, love the features! Just wish the price was lower!"
1,This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!
1,I came in to purchase a different streaming device and the store associate recommended this one instead. Glad I decided to stop in the store instead of paying more for the other device online.
1,"The Fire Tab 7 is one of our favorite Tablets, and you can increase storage by adding an SD card. No reason not to get one unless you don't like saving money."
1,"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid."
1,I am impressed with the quality of the Amazon Fire for the price
1,"Despite of being a good idea, it lacks some logic or connectivity.Most of the questions non-related to the Amazon universe don't have an answer. Although if you have a smart home/devices the functionality grows up exponentially."
1,"I think this tablet works as well as my $200.00 8in. HD Kindle Fire. At $35.00 it is a steal, it is such a bargain!"
1,"Have you ever thought...make sure to add this (t.p., eggs, shampoo, whatever) to the grocery list? With Alexa, I can just say ""Echo (which is what we named ours), add shampoo to the shopping list"" Voila! It is added to the list, which is then accessible to both myself and my husband on the app we have on our phones. I don't have to stop what I have moved onto to find the list, something to write with..you get the picture. Same thing for the to do list. We also have it connected to lamps which is ideal for my Mother who is wheelchair bound and can't reach switches. She just says, ""Echo, turn on sofa lamp"" and Voila! the light is on."
1,"Great features and for an excellent price. I bougth it for my son, 6 yrs old. It allows me to control what features he can use, Apps, books, videos, etc. He used an Android one (my wife's) before, and with this he still has access to all the apps he regularly used."
1,I paid $99 for this and couldn't be happier. It was super easy to set up.
1,"This tablet really help me out, as a great gift for my nephew"
1,its easy to use and the price was great my son loves it
1,Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!
1,Good device. My previous one was inherited and has a cracked screen.
1,"Lightweight and easy to use or read, the Paperwhite is wonderful! I purchased as a raffle prize for work and plan to get more. I have 2 people that have complimented me on them. They love them! Great item. Would recommend."
0,Have been using a tablet and find the Kindle harder to navigate.
1,able to access movies and TV--easy to use/easy to set up
1,"Easy set-up and fun for the family to use. Use the app to add more skills for Alexa as this will allow much more access to info, personalization and interaction. Have fun!"
1,"I bought the Fire for my husband to play his games on. He enjoys it, but it's not as fast as he'd like."
1,"I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad. This is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, I wouldn't get a headache over it."
0,Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
1,"I bought this tablet for my 6 year old and he loves it,so do i."
1,Great device don't much like the mandatory advertising
1,"My daughter loves this device. She loves to read and doesn't like kindles because she loves the feel of the book in her hand. But, this product offers her unlimited reading at a very inexpensive cost. And, it travels anywhere, is light, and just fantastic for her."
1,Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
1,Works well for the money. Got it from Black Friday deal. User friendly
1,"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
1,"About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
1,Easy to work and downloads fast. Very good quality.
1,Just needed a small tablet for video and surfing. Perfect.
1,Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
1,Overall good product and got everything I need to stay tune.
1,I like this much better than the fire stick. Great for Alexa!
1,Love this speaker. The quality is great for the price.
1,"Works great. Gives weather report ,sends shopping list. Love it"
1,I've been a Kindle user since the very first one came out to the market and I always wanted to be able to use touch to communicate with the device. This Kindle allows me to do just that.
1,"Otherwise, I have really enjoyed my Kindle Fire and use it all the time. Love being able to read anywhere. Also watch movies on it with good resolution."
1,Great product! Easy setup and easy navigation. Recommended
1,Very happy with this product. I would recommend for anyone
1,It has helped me not need the cable company and their many unnecessary channels
1,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
1,"Would highly recommend, great product great price."
1,"The Fire is a basic tablet, but it's the best I've seen for $50."
1,"Even with decreased vision, I can read this, and at night. The backlight is so helpful. Relatives who use this recommended it. Geek Squad were helpful in teaching me how to use it, since this is my first reader. Fits in my small purse and is so wonderful to have while waiting somewhere."
0,Bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. Unless you are amazon everything. Google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.
1,"Ordered one of these for my son for Christmas. It worked for about 6 months and then wouldn't turn on. Tried several things found on the internet to correct it, nothing worked. Best Buy gave us a deal on a replacement as we were outside of the warranty. A great service from Best Buy."
1,We love this Echo. The speaker is very good both volume and sound wise. We can hear the music throughout the house. It was easy to set up and is easy to use. No complaints here!
1,"Awesome product! Backlit, shows you page number & easier to turn pages."
0,"Nice, clear images, but very slow and the ads on the start screen are annoying. Also, the search engine, Silk, is not very good. Switch to Google if you can. Should have just stuck with the Digiland tablet--a lot more bang for the buck."
1,Smart and handy time saver and loud I love it voice control is amazing
1,"The Kindle Paper White is the perfect gift for anyone. My mom had the original Kindle and it recently broke. When I was looking for a new one for her I looked at other Kindles and e-book readers. I wasn't a fan of the Nook and the Kindle Fire is great, but she wanted something simple just to read so she didn't need the internet connection. After playing with the Paper White in the store I decided it was perfect for her. She is not the best with technology, but after I showed her how to use it once she was able to use it on her own. Great gift for anyone!"
1,"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!"
1,Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!
1,Great device. Only issue is if your not using it for music then the Dot is a better buy.
1,Bought this to upgrade my Echo Dot. Definitely happy with my purchase due to the louder and clearer sound that comes from it. Much better for listening to music than the Dot.
1,"The value of this device is amazing, the battery life could use some work tho"
1,i was deciding between the box or firestick and am glad i chose box. very happy with purchase
1,I like it.
1,The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.
1,This tablet is great for kids snd adults. It holds a lot of memory. U added a lot of games and pictures and still have a lot of space.
1,"I use it mostly to listen to music. With amazon prime (or Spotify, if that's your preference) I have almost every song that I'm interested in hearing without having to pay for anything. I haven't had the guts to order anything with it, but I'll work up the nerve eventually when I'm out of diapers or something easy."
1,I have really wnjoyed this tablet has not given me any reasons to dislike it.
1,Love this! So easy to use and navagate. Lots of options. Not sure how I went this long without it.
1,"I love my 7"" Fire Kindle...it's great when I go to appointments I can play some games or just read while I wait...light weight too not lugging around a bigger Reader..."
1,This was a replacement for a kindle It is a good device.
1,I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view
1,Bought this item cause it was bigger than my phone and I could put all my books on it with a larger screen.
1,"Good for convenience when other devices are tied up, but the keyboard lags a little slower than I would like."
1,They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!
1,I purchased two tablets as Christmas gifts and the children love them.
1,I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!
0,"Bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so I wasn't expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isn't the best. The amazon version of android really ruins things.. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the Android Play Store. Many apps on this Amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others- for ex- Youtube, someone basically made the website into an ""app"" but its $50 so its whatever"
0,Could not download apps I needed to control my tvs
1,Trying Apple TV for the first time. I love it! Can't wait to try out all the apps.
1,"I've really enjoyed using the Kindle Fire 10 (16gb). It's perfect for watching movies and tv shows. The only problem is the storage. Other than that, I highly recommend it."
1,"Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player."
1,"I bought it for a kid. I asked her about and she said she like it! In add, it is not expensive."
1,"I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations."
1,Unbelievable quality for a great price. Easy to set up and awesome customer support.
1,Excellent product just what I was looking for. works great.
1,"It's a great technology device and the voice recognition system works great! I can control my house thermostat and yard sprinkler system from the Echo. Echo can also be setup to control the lighting in the house as well. Echo also provides some entertainment for the kids when they ask her random questions and receive comical answers. I have to say it's really nice to just read my shopping list to Echo and have it on my phone for when I go to the grocery store. I've also done away with my alarm clock in my bedroom and use the echo as my alarm clock and weather station. If it's searchable on the Internet, Echo can usually answer your questions. Even though it still needs some fine tuning it's still a wonderful new piece of technology."
1,Works great for my 4 year old son. As for me I'm not that big of a fan because of the apps not that same as android or apply
1,"Great gadget. Didn't give it 5 stars because it has no option for a battery, must be plugged in for use. Also, I thought it controlled the TV, but apparently not. Speaker is OK for music if you don't like it loud."
1,"The fire TV box is 10x's better than the firestick. It's faster , has more storage, and is less glitchy."
1,Bought this as a gift for my niece. Hope she likes it
1,The Amazon Echo is a great addition to any home. It is a wealth of information and can be linked to other devices in your home for home automation. The echo even helps my kids with their homework.
1,Very good and easy to use and to set up. Use it more than regular tv.
1,its an excelent talber for the best price in market
1,"Coupled with Wink, this becomes an invaluable tool. I can't comment on audio quality as it's location is not ideal for sound. Voice recognition is the best I have used. Play CNN, Play x, Play y. It works very well. The Smart Home connection is really what I bought Echo for and it is fantastic. Make shopping list and see on your phone. Turn on x light or group of lights. Raise, lower thermostat. It all works very well. If you don't need audio quality, use DOTs. Echo is overkill for my use when DOTs are just as capable. With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought. But now realize DOT would have been fine in that location as well. I recommend Echo if you want a better sound for listening to music, but if you are connecting to your current AV system or are not putting in a location where audio quality is not required, go DOT. Oh and DOTs sound quality is acceptable for communication type audio."
1,Well made and profrssional looking. Operating manual clear and complete.
1,Having had a Roku as well the interface for the Fire TV far exceeds that of the Roku .
1,"Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter."
1,"A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age."
1,No issues works as good as ur internet... No buffering
1,"Don't know what I did before I had this. She is a great assistant in the kitchen, and am considering getting a couple of Echo Dot's for other rooms in the house. Very handy if you have other smart items in your home."
1,Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!
1,This device is very easy to setup and use and has great sound quality!
1,"I assumed this item would have a cord with the plug. Never assume. It was the plug only. The cord on my 7"" Kindle is very short so I bought a 4 foot cord also. Now I keep the shorter cord with me so I can charge on the go, the longer cord and new plug are what I use at home. Satisfied"
1,The Echo was very easy to set up and use. My wife has this set up in our living room and the sound is incredible. We use it for party's and plan to use for Christmas
1,I bought this with every intention on reading more. Unfortunately I haven't the time. Still. Happy with functionality and options. Would purchase for a family member
1,I bought it for my mother-in- law. I am her favorite now she loves it
1,"I purchased this device because I had the stick and I loved it. I knew this one has a faster processor, it would handle third party software better. I enjoy this product, it's really fun to use."
1,The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.
1,"One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)"
1,I love the Amazon Fire 7! It's very easy to use and I love the fact that you can turn the Blue Shade lighting on and off. It's fabulous for reading before bed.
1,"It is faster than amazon fire tv 1st. it was so easy to connect and work! Plus I have the 4k TV and it's a 4k system. You can watch some tvs, movies and some 4k contents for free if you are a amazon prime member, $99 plus tax for a year."
1,We love our Amazon Echo and Alexa. We are still new to it and are learning it's capabilities. But so far we absolutely live it. I'm thinking we will enjoy it even more as we take advantage of more features.
0,Glad it was half-price. Alexa doesn't know much compared to siri.
1,"Great Streaming and very smooth. I haven't had it lagging yet,"
1,This Firebox allows you to upgrade memory to store content.I love how it has alexa on it.
1,I had an older kindle that I still love but it didn't have the backlight. This one is lighter weight and has the backlight making it perfect to carry with me everywhere I go. So delighted that my husband thought to get this as a Christmas present for me to enjoy!
1,Easy to use and reasonably priced. I bought it for my wife as a Christmas present.
1,This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.
1,"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed."
1,Upgrades from fire stick. Works good but I really don't see the difference between the stick. I guess a little faster and less buffering
1,"For the $$, not sure it can be beaten. Its no iPad but its 1/10t the price"
1,"Works great. Love the size. Loved the price. Use mostly as a reader, but nice to be able to surf the net."
1,I like the tech but it goes off off line way to often and it's not that easy to get restarted some times.
1,It is really easy to program and use. I am looking forward to connecting it to some of the smart items I have In my home.
0,This is a neat little device but really not that good for much. I am sure it will improve in the future but I would recommend waiting it out.
1,this was a choice between the Oasis and the Voyage. i made the right choice
1,It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
1,Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.
1,It's fast small cute and great for web. I gave a few as gifts and everyonel over it.
1,Loveit . Easy to hook up and even our 4 year old granddaughter uses Alexa.
1,Very easy to use! Comfortable and easy to see screen. Lots of books to choose from.
1,"Myself and my two kids have these tablets. The do exactly what I need them for, to read and watch streaming shows. They have games for my kids and they are cheap so if they break them I'm not to worried."
1,So happy I ordered this at the same time as my kindle!
1,This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
1,"If you want a tablet to watch movies and use with Prime, this is awesome for the money. Not great to browse with but will get the job done. Can't beat for $35"
1,"Bought 2 of these as christmas gifts, simple and easy to use.Both are enjoying it for web browsing/recipes. I set them both up prior to gifting them, i know it is an amazon tablet, having to create another account and use a different app store stinks...But worth the value."
0,I brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.
1,Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
1,Great tablet for the price. I purchased this as a Xmas gift
1,I'm an avid reader. The Kindle is my go to for ease. It fits in my purse or knitting bag and stays charged for days.
1,My daughter fell in love with it instantly best ever
1,Just what you would expect from Amazon. Holds a charge well and does everything you would expect.
0,It wasn't what I thought it was the price was too much for what I got Very disappointed
1,I bought it for my nephew and he loves it is just perfect for works better then his hp tablet.
1,Perfect e-reader with great screen and backlight. Works great in every condition. Definitely recommend the Kindle Voyage!
1,Bought this for my nephew who reads a lot. He likes to download books and play games. Great price for the quality.
1,"This product is wonderful and has great sound, but really does all the same functions as the dot. Would only buy this if your looking for a better speaker. Great for the kitchen and or a central location in the house."
1,This tablet works just like expected. Great for the games I like to play. It is just the right size to carry in my purse. No problems.
1,There is so much content out there that is free and he fire is easy to use to watch it.
1,I Love To Read On This New Voyage. I Take it Everywhere With Me.Bought A Cute Book Cover For It Also. I Would Recommend This To Anyone Who Loves To Read & Doesn't Want To Lug Around Heavy Books. x x
0,This product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an SD card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box
1,I bought this on Black Friday for my 9 yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it
1,"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
1,Really enjoyed this like the hard wire instead of wi-fi great apps very easy to understand
1,Fun for a minute but soon realized I could have live without it. I use it to control my Phillip hue Lights and harmony remote which is cool but was a pain to setup.
1,Very small tab with a great resolution. Price is also low.
0,The Video quality on this is lacking compared to other streaming devices. In the plus side you can use kodi. I would get a roku if you don't plan on using kodI or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi.
1,Like that I can use it in so many ways. As a computer or a tablet
1,Best thing on the market everybody just pick one of this up
1,"Bought it for my mother in a nursing home, and didn't want to take a chance of an expensive tablet getting stolen. The childproof settings are perfect for the situation to prevent random purchases. The buttons for sending email are too small for someone whose eyesight and manual dexterity aren't perfect. It's a bit slow on response time, but for the cheap price, a minor inconvenience in this situation."
1,Bought for my students to use in class if they don't have a cell phone so we can play interactive games. Good price so I was able to buy a few.
1,Bought the paperwhite as a gift for my son. He wanted it for reading as he did not need all of the other apps found on the other Kindle products. He really likes it.
1,He loves his new tablet! For a thirteen year old he loves it and takes it everywhere.
1,Mi kids love to do there homework with Alexa and leasing to music
1,"Many uses weather, intercom, purchasing, games, and it continues to add functions"
1,"Works super well, always plays good music and movies"
1,"I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok"
1,"I've owned a couple of Kindles. This one is my favorite thus far. The screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that, great!"
1,"Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books."
1,"Interfaces with my Arlo system, tp-link system, and others via IFTT.Improving conversational capabilities which is a plus so you don't have to remember specific skills. Looking forward to true artificial intelligence capabilities."
1,Good machine and good service. Displays color as it should
1,Yes i recommend this item. It's also a good price.
1,"The tablet exceeds the price expectations. Great for reading books, ok for browsing. The time warner cable tv app works well with this device."
1,Replaced my 10 year old Kindle Reader with this. Nice and light. much faster than my old one too.
0,"I purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. I was so wrong. I couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi."
1,Purchased as a gift to my wife. She loves the tablet. Easy blue tooth attachment to sound bar. Good solid construction. Great for so many uses. Paying bills balancing check book. Writing and reading. Nice compact size. Replace bulky home computer and laptops. So many uses.
1,A week after my purchase this item went on sale. I think best buy should refund he difference without me having to drive 45 minutes 1 way to return and repurchase as the store advised when I call them . it's not like you don't have my credit card information.
1,eyes feel comfortable reading the paper white after lights out
1,"features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen."
1,"Hands down my favorite purchase lately,if you haven't bought one yet please go get it"
1,"I had to go through 2 tablets before getting this one, which is the best that I have ever had."
1,This product keeps you updated on the latest stuff just with the voice command
1,The kids absolutely love this tablet! Grabbed it while it was on clearance and ordered kid proof cases with them also! It's been great for road trips and all!
1,I would recommend this tablet to anyone very good tablet
1,"If you are looking for something inexpensive for your kids this Christmas, this is the one.Easy to operate, good quality and size for kids and adults."
0,It is okay does what it is suppose to amazon is kind of annoying but otherwise good buy
1,Love my Amazon Echo- use it everyday! Also like Echo Dot for telling me the weather everyday.
1,"Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth"
1,Very good screen for outdoors and nighttime use. Lightweight.
0,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
1,Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
1,I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.
1,The Echo with Alexa enabled is an excellent personal entertainment system. She is quite intuitive and always learning. Highly recommended.
1,"instead of spending a lot of money on a iPad for my kid, i bought this great alternative option. price is great! works great too!"
1,It work all my home kit with out flaw! it can hear me from across the room. echo is very smart
0,"We bought the tablet for work, but the only app we needed (free) never would download. After many tries and several hours, we gave up and took it back to the store."
1,"Why buy an I-pad when you can pay much less for a tablet that will do everything you need it to do, plus you get all the cost benefits of Amazon purchasing. One of the best buys on the market."
1,This is great little tablet that is very user friendly and lightweight!
1,I have tried them all and this is the most solid one. Better than Roku
1,"Bought so I could cut my cable. So far, so good. Easy to use."
1,Tryed the stick you wait a long time to receive any movie or show if you get it at all.
1,love it. sound quality is really good and it looks and feels amazing
1,Easy online purchase. easy use and setup and very useful device to have all around the house
1,"This was a gift for my daughter at Christmas. It is a great basic tablet, especially for the price. The only thing I would say that is a con would be the lack of apps available vs Android or iOS."
1,"you might find it somewhat short on available apps. My wife has an Android (Samsung) that is quite deep in app selection. That is not to say you can't find suitable choices. Every machine has it's qwerks and the Kindle starts up when you plug it in to charge. Unnecessary. Overall the 10"" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes."
1,Great and inexpensive tablet which meets all my needs and expectations.
1,Bought to get rid of uverse and installed Playstation Vue. Works great
1,The kids wanted to get this for their mom this year. I was somewhat skeptical but went along with it. My wife opened it up and the kids showed her how to use it. She absolutely loves it. She starts her morning off by checking the weather before getting the kids ready for school. She then either plays music or news depending on what her mood is in the morning. She likes the fact that she can just ask for an artist or a type of music and it plays. This time the kids were correct.This is amazingly easy to use. You only need to speak what you want. It answers most questions. You can give it items to put on a shopping list. You can then access those items from the Alexa app on your phone. No more paper lists.
1,I belive this tab is one of the best low priced tab on the market. There are a lot of free apps and the screen resolution is supurb I would recomond this tab highly!
1,For its size the speaker can still fill a pretty good sized room. We are really impressed with the sound quality. It's really cool how it can answer questions and shop for you. I also have it integrated with my Control4 system.
1,"It's a great tablet for every day needs. Great for games, internet access and reading Kindle books."
1,Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fianc downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
1,Perfect for my now 5 year old alittle off setting up since use to an iPad but she's doing great with it
1,"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos"
1,Great tablet with a great camera for begginers . Has enough memory to start off with
1,Purchased several tablets for the children for gifts. Easy to use hang the kids love them. My only complaint is that the charger could be more durable
1,My grandchildren love their tablets.they are easy to use.
0,got it to play games or get info when waiting at dr app
1,I like my new tablet which I use only for my reading.
0,"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50."
1,Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too
1,"Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the ""microphone"" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks."
1,My previous experience with Amazon stick was awful but after returning that I tried this product and was way better.
1,Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grand babies.
1,"can""t go wrong with this item it"" a great investment the price is right great streaming."
1,I love having Alexa! My fave thing is the shopping list. I look through my home and ask Alexa to add items to my list so I never forget anything!
1,The system was a breeze to set up and was amazed how easy it was to use. Everything from questions to jokes to music. Next step is to connect it to the house and TV.
1,Its a good tablet for being only 40 bucks usually people have to buy an expensive tablet for it be good.
1,"Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available."
0,Didn't work more that 4 months. Don't waste your money.
1,"Good device for anyone to use- simple, basic yet fun."
1,"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
1,This tablet has been easy to use and setup for my daughter.
1,This is only a good product if have amazon prime account
1,"Takes too many time, even being Prime"
1,"Love using Alexa for music and syncing her with Hue to run the lights, but don't like how specific you must be with the way you ask her. Sometimes just can't get the answer cause she wants to be asked in a different way."
1,"Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use."
1,"I just love my echo , controls my Hue lights just so easy to use."
1,I love my echo. I use it all the time from timer to music. Games are fun grandkids love it also. Great for helping keeping the brain working with some of the games water sound help me fall asleep faster. I got the dot to use in the bed room for water sounds alarm and music. Learn something new all the time with my echo.
0,It was just the worst software I've ever seen you could barely play or do anything
1,This saved me on my cable bill. Good quality. thanks
1,I found this item to be very useful for my daughters learning programs .
1,Item arrived as described. No damages and fast shipping.
1,Anything I have time to watch I can see on this box. Cuts cable bill in half.
1,"I love this thing. It controls my lights (additional components needed). I ask it questions. It gives me traffic and weather...and manages my shopping and to-do lists. I know I'm just only scratching the surface...but so far, I have no complaints."
1,We love the features of the Amazon Echo. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new gadget.
1,Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease
1,Great little assistant for around the house! Love all its little features!
1,Amazon hit the mark with this product ! Good voice and sound quality
1,Was waited on pretty fast. Shown what I needed and explained the features and warranty. All in all a great experience
1,My wife and I are just now getting the chance to explore the capabilities of this device but we are impressed. I really appreciate the emails every so often informing us of new things we can do with it.
1,This is a good tablet at a great price. Love it!!!
1,"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games."
1,"I got this to upgrade my wife's original kindle fire. While it is better, the original fire was still getting it done. Actually gave it to my parents who just wanted a basic tablet.Only draw back is the ads, but you can live with it"
1,I bought this Kindle as a gift for my brother. I already have one and love it so much I wanted him to have one too.
1,"Great product, excellent packaging, easy to use. Works my connected home well, however voice control gets some getting used to."
1,"I waited a long time to buy a Kindle Paperwhite, because I liked my first cheapo Kindle just fine. But I love, love, love the fact that it's backlit and I can read everywhere! The only thing I don't like, is with my old one, when I went to ""Home"", it listed my books and underlined the one I was reading. When I go to ""Home"" with the paperwhite, the books are showing but I sometimes have no idea which one I am reading because it's just showing the covers. I want a list with underlines!"
1,"Perfect for checking emails. Small, but not too small to watch my favorite shows/movies!! Would highly recommend!!"
1,I wanted a simple tablet to be able to download ebooks from my local library and get some more reading done. This definitely fits the bill! It's portable and slim and I can take it anywhere. Would definitely recommend!
1,I bough this for my husband and he loves it so much uses it everyday!! Worth ever penny!
1,"While I put Sonos throughout my home, I chose Alexa for in my shop. I spend a lot of time with my hands full or dirty, and it's great to play music or interact with Alexa apps and not stop what I am doing."
1,This is very easy for my 9-year old to use. It also works well for people of all ages in our family and it was a very good value.
1,I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet.
1,I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.
1,"Overall for the price you can't really complain, yes it has directed advertisements on the start screen when you turn it on but again, $50 for a tablet isn't that bad and the ads can be removed by subscribing to Amazon Prime which offers features in itself too."
1,Have so much fun with Alexa I am getting my mom one
1,This is just what this avid reader needed!! Now I can read everywhere.. even in bright sun light!
1,My kids love their tablets. They play games and take pictures.
1,This was a Christmas gift. Lots of games and books for children. Easy-to-use. 5 year old is in love with it. Nice size.
1,Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet
1,Screen is very clear and it is easy to use. Great product for the price.
1,"Lots of fun! It plays music, games, weather, and so much more. However, when making a phone call or text message, I hope they develop a way to determine who is able to send you a text message or phone call and make it so that you can call anyone you so choose in United States not just those that have the app or device. I do feel that Google may have a better device because they have more advanced database. Sometimes Alexa does not understand what you were asking and you would think she would be able to know it. But it is fun however if I had to do it over again I would've probably purchased a Google because I can just tell that it will probably be able to do more then just play music."
1,This is a wonderful product that can be used by everyone
1,"It is convenient, great size and efficient easy to use"
1,"I have had several Kindles (they don't last super long before breaking) and love reading on them. My only complaint is that they aren't very durable and tend to break after about 2 years of regular use. Being that they aren't super expensive, it's not a huge deal, but bit enough to not earn 5 stars."
1,I'm usually not a bookie kind of person. But reads occasionally. With paper white I got more chance and choice to read. So it helped me to improve my reading habit. A very good investment or gift for anyone of any age
1,Really Enjoy the sound quality! Like that you can do voice commands from anywhere in the house.
1,Accurate info relayed so farEasy to understandEntertaining
1,"We are enjoying Amazon Echo, but have had problems trying to set up my husband and my music to play. My husband had to contact Amazon service department to guide him on setting up, but we still struggled in getting music to play from our cell phones and our computers."
1,"This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere."
1,So many different ways to use the fire. I have just begun to learn some of the functions.
1,Easy to read on and awesome battery life. Great price.
1,"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned...."
1,"The new tablet is great  nice upgradesLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
1,"Good tablet for the price. Nothing flashy and does the job. Play games, search the Internet listen to music and watch movies."
1,Got it on sale for 35$ great tablet but pretty heavy and thick. Great for kids
1,unbelievable product gets you to really live the future
1,The grandkids needed some research help for school. I researched and found that the Amazon tablet was the the best for any age. Best But was the best place to go for the best buy and price....
1,Finally decided to upgrade from a Kindle 3 to the 2nd generation Kindle Paperwhite. Still hardly have to charge this thing and the back light is really nice for reading at night and is always the perfect brightness.
1,"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this."
1,We liked the newest model over the other models. The price was good during the holidays.
1,"We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this"
0,Way too expensive
1,"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads."
1,Good battery life. I don't have any problems connecting to Wi-Fi.
1,"Works well! I would highly recommend. Better quality than others I have for phones, etc. so I only use this one now.."
1,It's good to have this box if you like to watch tv series and programs other than spanish channels.
1,Very good tablet for kids. I bought a few and gifted them to kids of my relatives
1,"The Amazon fire works great! It's easy to setup, the picture quality is excellent, and the Alexis talk bottom makes searching for stuff easy. We just got rid of our cable, but kept the internet and we've saved over $70 on our bill. Streaming shows on the device is simple, but sometimes the movie or show would get stuck on fast forward. When it does that you have to stop the show then wait two seconds then resume. Other then that little issue, the Fire tv is a great device."
1,Once I figure out all the options I will be able to save money on my cable bill! It offers many channels and movies. Plus you are able to sign up for subscription channels as well. The downside is that it is only on one tv or maybe I just haven't read enough yet!
1,"This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend."
0,"I wanted a small tablet to read news and watch videos. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured why not, it is really cheap. Well, I believe you get what you pay for. This fire tablet froze on me, when I only had one thing open. I am very disappointed. It also is very slow when you rotate the screen. Ugh! I will be returning it."
1,I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!
1,Bought four of these for nieces and nephews. Works great been several weeks all four going strong and these kids can break anything really easy.
1,"The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content."
1,I bought this tablet mainly to use as an ereader. I now find myself checking emails and surfing the web too. Downloading an app is a simple process and there are lots to choose from. I use Overdrive and borrow books from my public library. I gave it a 4 because it seems a bit slow at times.
1,I am very please with my Kindle Voyage. The size is perfect and the control lighting is exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend this to anyone.
1,Best price I've seen on a tablet that does all what I needed it to do... Just simple things
1,I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
1,Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
1,I don't know how my household ran without my Alexa. She has become a member of our family!
0,"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying."
1,"Got this for $35 on Black Friday. Has some built in ads on the lock screen and does not include play store. After replacing the system with cyanogen mod 12.1, it's amazing - fast, nice battery, great build quality, glass screen.... Can't ask for more for under $65 or $75 minimum."
1,My special needs son is constantly cracking screens even with a protective case. This device is cheaper then replacing a screen. An extra note You Tube app has a different colored icon on this device.
1,"The new version has 300ppi, which is the same as the voyage. There is no reason to pay for extra $80 just for the page press."
1,Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
1,Allowed me to cut my satellite service and save $100 a month. No worrying about commercials or missing shows.
1,"Looked around for a while for an inexpensive tablet. Most of the ones under $100 were not worth purchasing. I was a little suspect when I saw the $50 Fire but having owned an Amazon tablet before I decided to try it out. I must say I was impressed. Obviously it's a budget tablet so you are not getting a full HD screen or iPad like performance but it's also a 5th of the price. It definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing, Facebook, casual games and media consumption. If your a Prime member it's a great way to stream all of your Amazon Video shows & movies. The build quality is much better then other tablets under $100 and it's a multi-touch screen, not one of the plastic capacitive touch screens. Great tablet for kids, grandparents, people with light needs, or people just looking for an inexpensive way to stream Amazon Video."
1,"Faster than the stick. Overall it is great. 4 stars due to occasional buffering or errors. My internet speed is fast enough, so it isn't clear if internet or box is issue. I use with PlayStation vue and I am happy with it and cancelling cable!"
1,Bought for my husbands birthday and am very impressed!
1,"Gave this to my 6 year old. Not a big fan of the Amazon app for purchasing and downloading apps, but other then that he has no problems with it."
1,"if you know the workarounds of the amazon kindle environment, this tablet is a good choice. cheap, lightweight and the expandable memory are the best features."
1,"The vacation house we rented for a week this summer had an Echo Dot. We didn't know what it was until it started talking to us as we must have activated it somehow. After our shock, we found that it played music, told jokes, and was in general, fun to use. So, we we arrived home, we began exploring what the Echo could do. Wow. It is amazing. We have been Amazon Prime members for many years and this is a logical extension of the Amazon ecosystem. I think most folks who use Prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do. However, not everyone likes it. My son-in-law says its creepy to have something listening to you in your home. So, most folks will have to get over that. For the price, it's well worth it to explore the future of technology!"
0,Very different from my iPad. I'm sure I will get the hang of it.
1,"Many of my friends raved about how well the Fite Tv performed and after months of hearing great things about it, I have to say this has been one of the best investments."
1,"Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web."
1,Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites
1,Bought this as a replacement for her Samsung tab 3 that was no longer holding a charge....seemed at first to not like it so much but has grown on her since using for her educational activities and some games from the Amazon app....asked daughter if she liked the fire and she said yeah pretty well
1,Great! I would definately buy again! I use this often.
1,"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps."
1,Gift for my wife to listen to her music when she's sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out.
1,I go to hotels frequently and do not like satellite tv or their limited channel selection. This small device connects easily to the wifi and all flat-screen TVs I have found. Life saver on a 2 week training event.
1,"The first of these failed after a week or so with lines in the screen. I took it back to BB and they replaced it with another. I was able to automatically reinstall everything I had on the first with no problem. I love this device. I bought it to download and read books from my library, but it does much more. It notifies me when I receive mail and I switch from a book to it and can read it on the device and then easily switch back. I can also do a lot of research that I normally do on my PC. I highly recommend it."
1,It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
1,Easy to set up and user friendly. This is my second device we have added to our home.
1,This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix
1,I bought a FireStick because of the price. After purchasing the FireTv don't think I'll go back. Also if you buy this product sign up for your free Amazon Prime and checkout the movies and tv shows you get in HD and 4k..
1,Great product.......................................
1,Great speaker and Amazon is adding more functionality all the time
1,I purchased the Ecco as an addition to my home automation. Works great. The wife and kids love it.
1,Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
1,I was able to grab this tablet for $35 during black friday. I was surprised at how great this little tablet was for that price. I would definitely recommend it if you can grab for that great price.
1,This is the second Fire I've owned and have found them to be a good reliable tablet.
1,This is a great item. I connected it with no problem. The streaming features are awesome.
1,I like the color quality of the tablet and the size is perfect for at home or on the go.
1,I am very happy with my purchase of the Kindle paper white. I wanted a device for reading at night that would allow me to turn the light off in the room. Works well is lightweight and really a joy to read on. Very limited and dissappointing selection of protective covers at Best Buy had to purchase elsewhere.
1,"Absolutely love my Echo, from helping with our shopping list, listening to music, checking the daily weather and news, to just telling the occasional joke. You will find yourself talking to Alexa every day! It's a life changer!"
1,"This is a nice little tablet, for me since I don't do a lot on a tablet, it's a great size. It took a little getting use to working with, but am a little more comfortable with it now."
1,Was bought for a gift for my mother. She loves it and works great
1,This is a good purchase for online surfing and checking my mails
1,Speed is great. Backlight is great. The screen isn't reflective - great.
1,Very easy to setup and use.would recommend this product.
1,"easy to read, great product When I use different readers they keep tract of where I am in each."
1,I have bought a lot of tablets for my kids and all have broken. This tablet has lasted the longest and is the most kid friendly.
1,Great product. This is my 2nd one. My first one was stolen. It is very user friendly.
1,The firestick tv is awesome and easy to use its also small
1,Best thing for me!! Does everything I want it to !
1,Best e reader yet ! The new voyage is much better then the first Paperwhite which was great !
1,"Haven't figured it out fully yet, but can do and answer many things."
1,Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also
1,I love it! Perfect size to carry with me in my purse.
1,My 11 year old loves it and does a lot more than just games on it
1,"This is one of the best product amazon have on the market now, very fast and reliable."
1,"Cutting the Cable TV cord. Mostly very positive, only negatives are lack of fast forwarding on some channels. Cannot get the CW channel but that is available via free app. Over all it rocks."
1,Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because I wanted to be able to watch Sony Vue in the bedroom without having to get another Playstation console. We have an Apple TV (newer model), and I like it a lot too, but the Fire TV allows me to watch both Amazon Prime content and the Sony Vue channels, which I can't on my Apple TV. The Amazon Fire TV is very responsive, has great Apps, it is lightweight and doesn't take up much room. In fact, we have it hanging in the back of our TV which is mounted to the wall, and you can't even see it. I highly recommend it."
1,"I decided to cut cable and thought this Amazon TV would be a good alternative . It's a great product I really do like it ! It takes a little while to get used to using it ,there's a lot of clicking to get to a show ! However , I am not a prime member so there are a lot of shows that we can't watch !"
1,I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!
1,Hopefully works great this is for my 3t son. Can't beat the price.
1,"I had known Amazon was going to release the next Generation a few weeks after I bought this one! OTOH, my wife is happy with it. It just offended my geek side. However, it has Alexa and integrates well with my Philips Hue equipment."
1,Gave this to my son for Christmas. He loves it. Speed is good for what he does and battery life seems good enough for him.
1,This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.
1,"Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it"
1,"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
1,"this was the 2nd fire i bought for my daughter after the 1st i purchased at christmas stopped working after only a couple of months, the screen froze up and would not ever reset and couldnt be saved, she does use it everyday so i guess we got our moneys worth of use out of it for the 50 dollar price tag"
1,Enjoy quick fact checks like who was in this movie or how tall is Lebron James but wouldn't spend the money it costs myself. It was a gift. Maybe I haven't learned enough of the functions yet.
1,"The Fire tablet is great for the kids and runs smoothly most of the time. It sometimes freezes when in the kids profile such as when the apps have an ""x"" on them and won't open for an extended amount of time."
1,Really nice product surprise about how great and fast it works
1,"Bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day. We have the philips hue bulbs which this syncs with which is really nice. Love that you can ask it questions, how's the traffic to work etc."
1,I love this device I use it everyday for all tv uses.
1,Like the size and ease of use. Holds charge. Easy to download books. Easy to read.
1,Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
1,Got one for my kids and they love it! It was super easy to set what apps they could have access to and stream prime shows. Not a huge fan of the Amazon app store compared to my android phone.
1,"You get what you pay for, with that being said. For 50 bucks i'ts great. It's not super fast wont play heavy games. But, it will netflix and read books fine. Screen is plastic, not glass like most so it scratches VERY VERY easily."
1,Must have if you like to read on a tablet. Easy to carry and read.
0,"Because the Amazon Fire 7 is a very inexpensive tablet, you cant really expect much out of it or compare it to an iPad. It is a great budget tablet for very light gaming and watching videos. My primary use for it is for video consumption."
1,"I enjoy using this basic but useful tablet. I have a standard smart phone, and I like using this Fire tablet at times to take advantage of the somewhat larger screen to read and review certain items. Photos and graphics appear clearly and with good color on the Fire tablet."
1,"We upgraded to the 4K version. It has better buffering, and we love the voice search capabilities on the remote. It is super simple to set up and start watching your favorite programs. It also let's you add external apps like Kodi. Well worth the money."
1,Love it. I like being able to read when the lights are off.
1,Love my tablet. I'm not used to using amazon but its good now
1,For low price it works great for everything that we need to use it for.
1,We bought this for my daughter.. She love it too much.. And it's the best tablet for the price..
1,Easy to set up. Anyone can use this. Doesn't take a technology wiz to set up and have fun with it. Love the music library.
1,It was a great buy at Black Friday easy to use very portable
1,This is amazing for helping you keep track of stuff. Also fun to just talk to Alexa.
0,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
1,Described as its written and good price. Very helpful staff.
1,It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
1,Love my Alexa . Very responsive and technologically advanced product.
1,Everything about it is outstanding except the price!
1,"Bought it for my son, he was very please with it !!"
1,bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it
1,My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
1,I like all the functions that it offers and then some
1,This Kindle Paperwhite 7th gen. Is perfect. Along with it and using Calibre software I can do anything with it. Very impressed.
1,This tablet does everything and it's so much cheaper than an iPad. I don't know why people spend so much for an Apple when you get everything here for a fraction of the cost.
1,Great tablet for beginners or anyone and a great value
1,"This is an easy to use tablet. It was easy to set up and easy for my 6 year old to use. I purchased one of the off brand tablets for my other kid and have had a lot of problems with the charging port. Not with this tablet, worth a little extra money."
1,Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price
1,"I think Alexa is the best...Have to buy the other smart components,but so far so GOOD!"
1,"We have had a Fire Stick for quite some time that we use for our Playstation Vue subscription. I decided to purchase the Fire TV as a second Playstation Vue device because it has the wired ethernet option, and WiFi isn't a reliably fast enough connection for the streaming services. The Fire TV performs wonderfully, and is much snappier in performance than the Stick even in the menus. Our Apple TV has now been unused for several months."
1,"Sound quality excellent, functionality is smooth, App required a day or two for full comprehension. System works beautifully, my sons especially have enjoyed the lighting integration with our LIFX and the Amazon Prime Music requests. Will be expanding the system when ""Dot"" returns."
1,"I bought this tablet for my granddaughter..it is perfect, and she loves it."
1,Yes this is a fantastic product so many things to do with said product...
1,"Box works great for cutting the cord for cable, specs are great ."
1,"The kindle fire has exceeded my expectations, especially given the $50 price tag. Easy to use for someone like me, who is not tech-savvy. Lots of awesome free apps, and I am finding new ways to play with it every day. Would definitely recommend this device to others."
0,"The tablet is good for a 12 year old, i got it for my niece for Christmas and it will do what she wants,which is to play games and read books. Amazon is a little annoying because she had a hard time downloading some of the movies, because it wasn't ""compatible"", which is dumb since its their tablet and their site she was getting them from."
1,It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.
1,Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account
1,Got this as a gift to my mom. She absolutely loved the color and how easy to use.
1,I bought this for my 3 and 2year old and it works the same as a free time tablet but for a fraction of the price
1,"Tablet easy to use and is great for face book, internet, watching movies, and reading. price was great."
1,"Excellent product, amazing resolution, great quality"
1,I also have a Nook but a ton of glare. I can read my Kindle Paper White anywhere! Love it.
1,"This is my first tablet, and I have yet to do much more with it than read news articles and comic books. But I really like its picture quality and intuitive usability. My only complaint is that it doesn't support certain Microsoft and Google applications."
1,This it's a great tablet for kids it does a good kid and keep them busy
1,Good reader for teenagers. Recommended by a friend.
1,Works perfectly. Is quick and fun to use. Music sounds great.
1,This product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter
1,Bought 2 for birthday gifts for grandkids!!! Reasonable priced and they work great!!!
1,"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
1,This is our 5th kindle. We love these. They are easy to use and the screen is a nice size. They are lightweight and great for reading.
1,Purchased for 2-5 year olds. Works well for them..
1,I bought this for my kids to play on. It fills that aspect great but the battery might last two hours of continuous use.
1,"After not being extremely keen on choosing ""Alexa"" for my husband's birthday gift I am now a total fan! While he loves the customized music play lists, I use her for just about everything else! Her shopping and to do lists have saved me countless trips (and gas) for what I would normally forget to do while I'm out the first time! (Great for Earth Day conservation)!"
1,"It took the place of my Nook, so is taking quite a bit of adjusting."
1,Was given a Kindle from Best-Buy stock.... it was white but from the package labeling you can't tell the color and return it.Got the BLACK KINDLE... college student son loves it for all the class reading he has to do..... connects to college wifi seamlessly and downloads the syllabus and assigned readings.Easy to carry and read indoors or outdoors.
1,"AMAZON ECHO IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT AND ALOT OF FUN,ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAY GOOD MORNING TO ALEXA, SHE ALWAYS TELLS A JOKE FOR THE DAY AND THIS ITEM IS ALOT OF FUN AND AMAZING, IT IS GREAT MAKING YOUR MUSIC PLAYLIST UP AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE ALEXA PLAY IT WHEN YOU WANT TO!JUDI"
1,This is a great Kindle for the price. I can take pics of my flowers and send them to my kids. I can download books and read anywhere. I can play games. I can look things up on the web. It's small enough to take any place I go.
0,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
1,The Ehco is awesome. I get my morning weather report daily along with the evening news as well. Plus all my music is just one request from Alexa away. The technology is amazing. Having a ton of fun with it. This item would make a great gift.
0,Not many apps I'd use. Not as useful as I'd hoped.
1,Cant say enough good things about this product....we also have the fire sticks for other tvs.....This sure does beat paying for cable. It is very easy to set up and use.
1,"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
1,This is the little tablet that could!!!The price is a steal and the speed and function deliver. Not a great camera but functional. Not great for skyping but that aside a real bargain!
1,I was looking for a bedroom speaker and came across the Amazon Echo on sale. it fits my lifestyle and a great way to get my just bit smarter.
1,"Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to."
0,This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.
1,GReat an fun product for the whole family. Kid wakes up an asks Alexa the weather to get ready.
1,"ask yourself if you want a chromcast for 1/3 the cost of this device or do you want to up to PS4 and pretty much get all the features this has and a gaming platform. Then again, you can tweak this system with after market software which you can't on the other two. If you like amazon, are on a budget and have prime, might as well go deeper into the amazon ecosphere."
1,Best product to use if your are a movie watcher.i use mine on weekends when it's time to relax or nothing to do.
1,The Amazon Fire Tv has worked great for us! Super easy set up!
1,I look forward to coming home to Alexa. She's awesome!
1,"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
1,Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.
1,"Easy setup, the speaker sounds great for music!! Alexa is quite responsive LOL and quite intelligent."
1,Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
1,"I purchase 6 of these tablets for my grandchildren Xmas present. I loved it so much, I will be purchasing one for my self."
1,"I bought these for my nieces at Christmas -- I got an 'echo dot' for myself. These are SO cool. I added a wifi lamp switch. I can turn the light on/off, get the weather report, have music played ... all with my VOICE !! crazy cool ..."
1,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
1,"Use it everyday..never had a problem,perfect for gaming ,internet,email,etc.i use it for everything.priced nice"
1,"I wanted to buy the Echo for my husband and he loves it. We love to ask questions and play music. In the future, we want to connect our devices that are compatible with Alexa."
1,"I got this on Black Friday weekend for $35. It was my 2nd Fire. It can do a lot, but the thing that I like about it the most is that I can take it anywhere. If I lose it or it gets stolen, I am only out $35. The new feature that I like is blue shade. I use my tablet in the evening with no worries that I will have trouble going to sleep."
1,I love it because my grandson can use itEasily to play his games
1,"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
1,My old kindle died after almost ten years. Upgraded to this new model. I like the upgraded features and it is still easy to use. It's the best on the market if you just need a reader.
1,This was a gift to my sister in law and she loves it. Only comes with 8GB of memory but you can upgrade to 128 and she did.
1,Alexa is as smart as you program her to be. Nice sound when linked to music sources.
1,Worth for the price paid. Love this product so much
1,"I bought the fire tv to replace my rented cable box....Ditched traditional cable and am using fire tv with playstation vue app....picture quality is excellent, was paying almost $200/mo with traditional cable, now paying $40/mo for basically the same channels...."
1,I went from an Amazon Fire stick to this tv and there is literally no lag in response time!
1,"Like many others, I decided to cut cable and move to more online based video services. The Amazon Fire TV has easily become a centerpoint of our living room. We stream all of our favorite apps off this device (Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, NBC Live Extra, Playstation Vue, WATCH ESPN, and many more!).Pros: The Amazon Fire TV is portable and much more powerful than its little brother, the Fire TV Stick. The Fire TV has double the cores, double the RAM and has a slot for memory expansion when compared to the Fire Stick. Of course that all comes at a price, but its worth it. The Fire TV does not buffer nearly as often as my Fire Stick or Chromecast. This device is a 4K streaming device, but you'll need to find 4K content to take advantage of it.Cons: The experience from the get-go is VERY Amazon centric, with the platform optimized for searching and viewing Amazon video titles. I havent found the Voice Control to be of much use, as it is only really helpful for searching Amazon video."
1,"Bought it for my mom, she like to play games in her tablet is it is perfect."
1,I enjoy having the tablet when I am travelling. Great size.
1,I have two Apple I-Pads that my students and I use in my third grade classroom. I've wanted one for home use but didn't want the expense. This Amazon Fire tablet does just about as much as my school Apple I pads but at less than a quarter of the cost. The amazon fire tablets are smaller but easy to use and amazingly fast loading! wish i had one for each student!
1,I love the Echo. Despite the fact it makes me lazy :). It's a great home tool .
1,"My wife owns one, so we bought one for my mom who is not tech-savvy, and she seems to be having great success with it so far. Had to buy a case separately because for some reason Best Buy doesn't have any avail in store or even on-line, but the Fire itself is great for light users."
0,Great concept and easy for kids to use but it does take a lot of set up in many different areas to work like you want it to. You can't just plug it in and go.
0,"On my opinion I bought very-very good toy for the people who loves play with technology of the future.. I'm really enjoy when I demonstrate it to my friends and they are impressed. But unfortunately it is not useful for most of the standard users. As I said in a most cases it's just a ""GOOD TOY""..."
1,Great sound. Very clear and clean. Bass will shake the room
1,Easy set up. Easy to use. Hdmi cord right into the tv or sound system. And you are up and running.
1,Bought it for my 14 year old daughter who is autistic. She had no problems figuring out how to work the tablet. She's on it everyday!
1,kids mode is awesome...cheap tablet...packed with enough apps
1,"Before you conclude it does not have enough, look at what it can do and read the specs."
1,This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one.
0,I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet. Although my amazon fire still works its screen is all cracked oh well.
1,"Great for the grandkids, they know how to manage them better than I do."
1,This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
0,Movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it.
1,"This is a great starter tablet for the price - It is easy to use, expandable and cheap and able to use for surfing and reading and games"
1,"I was not sure weather Alexa would be a real help and flexible enough to be useful. It is ! Great fun and great info. If it only was able to play my music, Pandora and IHeart Music it would be worth it but it does so much more. Every day we learn how ask the right questions to get the best answers and info. The weather and timer are always helpful. Daily Bible verse is great. Her programmed answers to regular interaction is great. I Highly recommend this product."
0,It's a good tablet for the price considering it was only $50. Not the best quality but suitable for my kids to enjoy
1,"I own a firestick, so I decided to invest in a Amazon Fire TV box. It streams my movies really well and the picture quality is great. I really love my Fire TV box and I am recommending the Fire TV box to my family and friends. I do not regret this purchase."
1,It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
1,I would recommend the Kindle Fire as a great option for anyone who loves to read book after book. Well worth the price. Not so thrilled that a 2 year warranty was half the price of the item I purchased but that has nothing to do with the quality of the device.
1,Got this for my mother in law and she loves it. It's easy on your eyes and it is very user friendly.
1,"Found I am using the ""Fire""' more then my phone. Speed is fast.. Easy to navigate."
1,For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.
1,I love this I installed all my videos. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.
0,The dot does everything this does and most people already have blue tooth speakers to hook up to it.
1,"This tablet is excellent when you are an on-the-go person. You not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. You will not have to lug a big book with you if you’re out and about. I have never had a tablet where books can be downloaded onto it (and it’s free). I am one satisfied customer!"
1,"This Samsung watch is just what the doctor ordered. I can see who's calling,texting,e-mailing all while watching my health at the same time ! Great product"
1,This thing is amazing. The voice recognition is awesome and it does an excellent job picking up my voice even when playing music. Its integration into my smart home was flawless and adds a whole new level to my home.
1,Perfect upgrade from the original fire stick great quality!
1,The echo has be a nice addition to the home. Helps connect other devices and Amazon features. Great speaker quality. Fun to use
1,"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
1,Loved this tablet before. Happier now with lower price and expandable memory.
1,Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
1,"I bought this as a christmas gift.. The person I bought it for had a different brand and had troubles with it, they have been extremely happy with the Fire tablet"
1,Super and funIs work in my xbox one sMy light insteon
1,Granddaughter loves it. She plays on it daily and downloads the games with no problem
1,"Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
1,It was a gift for someone so I don't know about it
0,Didn't like it. To many pop up ALL THE TIME. Don't recommend at all
1,Alexa is a great music ai product. I totally love it! I bought it because many of my friends have it and i personally would recommend it to other friends.
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is reliable, holds a charge for weeks, is lightweight and easy to hold, allows you to read in bed at night without eye strain or bothering anyone (because of the backlit surface), and stores hundreds of books. What can I say? I love my Kindle, and this one was the second I have bought...this one as a gift for an elderly parent. She loves it! The font is easy to adjust for people who need large print. I take my Kindle everywhere so I am never bored whether I am waiting in the doctor's office or stuck in an airport overseas.."
1,Perfect gift for the tech family and introduction to the numerous options now available through wireless connections
1,I gave this to my daughter and son N law for Christmas. They seem to really like it and are just starting to get the hang of it and learn more about it. But their initial using of this is all good and they like what it can do..
1,Bought this kindle for my 75 yr old mother. She loves it.
0,"Great for reading, not great for playing games needs more storage."
0,i bought this for someone for a gift for xmas. this is a good simple tablet for someone to being with.
1,"It took me a bit to warm up to it, going from a 10"" tablet to this little 7"", but it is rapidly becoming my go to. The video quality is great, and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet. I love the convenience of having a smaller tablet - my only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer than the 7 hours. That said - in sleep mode it lasts days. Very happy, and will be purchasing a larger Fire tablet in the future."
1,the kids love it they learn something every day i'm happy i bought it
1,"Alexa answers a lot of questions, plays any song you want, and has great sound!"
1,It is a very handy device and I highly recommend it. I also enjoy using Alexa on it.
1,My 12 year old son bought this. Great for him. Only downfall is his old one broke after only one small drop. Would recommend protection plan.
1,"Bought this for my son, he really enjoys using it especially as an e-reader,"
1,"got this a gift for a friend, she loved it and the things she can do with it."
1,Its now a part of our family. Its so much easier to ask for the time in the morning while my eyes are still closed and lights off. Setting the alarm has been a breeze too. Just before we go to sleep me tell Alexa to to sing us some songs and we tell it to stop and its done. I am now looking forward to get the lights connected to this as well.. Love it so far. The only thing is I wish it had a better search features that would search on the web.
1,"Simply great. Really comfortable to read, even for hours. Took me a bit to get used to the light settings though, but once I got the hang of it, really nice."
1,"Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!"
1,This was a great price and excellent gift. It has a lot of built in apps that both adults and kids will enjoy.
1,Awesome little machine...kids talk to it everyday five times a day!!
1,Incredibly awesome device. Signed up with Amazon music and I've been jamming nonstop.
1,Great picture compared to my last kindle and love the camera option
0,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution."
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great tool to keep around the house. We keep ours in the family room/kitchen area. Simply ask Alexa a question and she will provide the answer. Also, link up to Pandora or your Amazon music account and she'll play music for you. Good speakers as well.."
1,We bought a second tv so we needed another firetv box. It works great with the services we're using.
1,Bought this for my 7 year old daughter. Great first tablet for a child.
0,Product was damaged. Needs lot of improvement on the API's.
1,Love it amazing easy to use love the look sound amazing
1,Kids are able to play their games and watch movies on road trips.... win!
1,Battery life is excellent. Lasts days. No glare when reading outside
1,"This is my third Kindle, first two worked out great for my kids so I got another. Great value for money"
1,Bought this Kindle because I could not read my older one in the sunshine. This fits the bill.
1,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker."
1,"The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books."
1,"Apps for square, PayPal, and such not available bought thinking best option for business. Not so. Needed inexpensive great. Need certain apps check before buying."
1,Product was good for $50. Heavier than I expected. I was looking to replace an older Kindle. Nothing fancy but adequate.
0,"Could not download my books at home. Three visits to Best Buy, returned it."
1,I was not surprised by anything I found out. The deviae works as advertised. It's great with the simple commands. I hope it interfaces as well as I've read about with Harmony and SmartThings.
1,I got two of these for my kids. If they break oh well. Good for a step up from leappad.
1,I like the box much better than the stick. It has more memory along with optical out for surround sound etc. Voice activated remote and just overall smoother. Definitely worth the money to upgrade to the box over the stick.
1,This a good tablet. How ever I made it better by putting cyanogen mod on this to use the full android operating system
1,"This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price."
1,It allows us to watch movies and stuff that we normally would not get to see.
1,This is a great device to have if you dont have cable at home and you need to add a program call Kodi also.
1,Had the HD Fire 6 and was disappointed that it did not have an SD slot. This one has the slot and has worked flawlessly. My kids love it. I bought 3 of them.
1,Alea echo is hands down the best smart device manager I've ever owned.
1,This is my 4th Kindle and I enjoy reading on it. Goes every where with me.
1,"I got this tablet for my 7 yr. old daughter, for the price its very good. Its the perfect size for small children."
1,I love the Amazon Fire. I am able to play all my movies and shows on my fire. It's great!
1,"It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast."
1,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo
1,"I've had the Fire Stick for awhile, and thought it was just fine, why spend more for the Fire TV? Well now that I have the Fire TV, I'm glad I bought. It is faster than the Stick, and works better in every way. Love the voice command! Get one!"
1,"Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place. It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting Go To Footnotes. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the x at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as 91 highlighters would appear between the lines. Supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text. Does not highlight any text."
1,"I purchased 2 of these for my kids, (7yrs and 15yrs old) and they love them. They're constantly staying on them. The battery lasts for about 8 hrs and not long to charge. I love the fact they they come pre-charged too. What ever you do, please buy a case for them. I couldn't have brought a better budget tablet."
1,"Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!"
1,Lightweight and compact e-reader that is suitable for any age who loves reading on the go.
1,"I use this item every day to get subway conditions, news, music, alarms and calendar schedule for the day. I would highly recommend!"
1,"I purchased this pad for my boys. It is an excellent pad for a great price. They use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. Sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. I couldn't be happier with my choice. If your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!"
1,Excellent base model e-reader. Nice to use inside or outside.
1,I love this for it's music capabilities. Great sound. Easy function
1,My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.
1,These tablets are so much better in different colors. Well worth it!
1,I received this as a gift and loved it so much that I bought one for my husband.
1,Awesome for the kids and a great price....does the same as an expensive one
0,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
1,For the price you pay and to do basic functions this table is well worth the money.
1,"This is really helpful for everyday use. Helps with entertainment, ect. I really enjoy.. Echo"
1,Easy to set up and start using. Love having any type of music at the prompt of my voice!
1,Its a great worth of the money spent on it. Good for reading
1,Great value. I don't have any issues with this tablet. Some others mentioned ebooks were difficult to read but I don't have that problem. The storage is tight so I added a 64GB card to it. I use it every day.
1,More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.
1,Tablet purchase good and affordable for the price.
1,Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one.
1,The tablet has been great for reading and the picture is large enouph
1,"I needed something that's not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it's not iPad, but it's good for a tablet)"
1,"This amazon fire box works great. I don't have cable, we use the apps and Netflix that is connected to wifi. Easy to set up. We have one in every room."
1,"Amazon has been marekting this via emails to me for a while. Didn't think much of it at first until I found out this works well with home automation. I have almost every light in my home ""connected"" using a Smartthings hub. I look so cool to my friends that have never seen an Echo before. With a quick command I can turn on or off any of my connected lights one by one or use an IFTTT command to turn everything on or off. Yes, it works with IFTTT!!! You can get pretty creative with it. Having a multi-level home, I can command Echo/Alexa to unlock my front door after seeing who it is via my Ring doorbell :). This is one cool device for lazy people like me LOL. I use it to get the weather, traffic, sports scores (Go Warriors!), and create/add items to my shopping list. It plays music from numerous streaming music services but being a Prime Member and having used everything from Pandora to Spotify I find Prime Music the best for my taste in music. It's also free with my Prime Membership so I don't have to listen to ads or get stuck not being able to skip a song I don't particularly like. I've also just recently purchased the remote which is a great accessory. I leave the Echo in my dining room/kitchen area and I can send commands to Echo from my bedroom without a glitch. I can't wait for my Echo Dots to arrive. Call me an Echo fanatic but I tell you...it's an awesome piece of technology. And it keeps getting better as Amazon continues to develop and add new features. My only gripe is that I can't control my home security system with it. Simplisafe just doesn't want to play with anyone...boo!"
1,"nice price, loved the price match--easy to get refund of cost differencemuch simpler to view than original kindle"
1,"Our Alexa stopped working so Amazon customer service suggested I try purchasing a new adapter. It arrived and fixed the problem. It was a much cheaper, and easier fix than I anticipated. Very happy with this product!"
1,"bought this for my 2 years old, the tablet is strong, and he loves it, and best part is i was able to download the google play store without rooting."
1,"The Kindle Fire was a perfect gift for my wife. She has not been a big fan of newer electronics in general and needed something compact, affordable and very easy to use."
1,It's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.
1,The Fire TV is by far the best of any of the Stream Boxes
1,Easy to use. Easy download games. Kids love to do school work on tablets
1,Got two of these for my father and mother in laws for Christmas and they absolutely love them. Easy to use and great first tablet.
1,This was the best purchase I've made in a while. The text quality it excellent and the back-lighting is a real plus.
1,I brought this tablet for myself. Good product especially for what I paid for it. Got it on sale for $33 on Black Friday online. Very happy I didn't have to wait in line at the stores.
1,Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution
1,Works flawlessly most of the time. Would be 5 stars if amazon would stop fighting against people rooting their devices. It's our streaming box. Let us do what we want with it.
1,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
1,"Already had one Echo and enjoyed it so much, I couldn't pass up getting another one at almost half price during Best Buy's Amazon deal day."
1,The echo was easy to set up and connect to Spotify and the sound quality is good. It's pretty good at basic questions like time and weather but it's natural language understanding isn't as good at understanding and answering more complex questions.
1,I got this for a friend an was very pleased. The fire tablet is awesome. It dose everything the kindle fire dose.
1,Good value for the price and for the children. The apps are enough to let them play and read.
1,Love how I can read in bed without the light on so it does not bother my husband. And it keeps me from cluttering the house with so many books. Also don't have to wait til you make it to the store to buy the next book cause they are all right at your finger tips!
1,"If you are looking to add smart TV capabilities to your TV (or replace existing smart TV capabilities), this is the product to own! In my opinion Amazon knocked it out of the park with this streamer. Paired with a 4K TV, it adds amazing clarity to 4K Content!"
1,Love my kindle! This is my 3rd kindle. I can't live without. I do wish it has audio capability.
1,Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
1,"This is my third one, don't use anything else for reading books."
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV to cut my cable and use it for Play Station Vue. It has worked great. It is super fast compared to the fire stick. I tried the Roku as well but for this application the Fire tv was the clear winner. I liked it so much I bought 3. One for all my Tvs. The Roku didn't have a guide menu and that was a big issue. It also works great with Netflixs. Picture quality is great, probably better than what I was getting with cable. Overall this is going to save me a lot of money and I am not missing any quality or channels."
1,Product works as advertised. Setup is easy with Alexa mo Ike app for initial configuration. Speaker is perfect for streaming.
0,I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
1,"The firestick with voice remote has tamed the TV again, making watching enjoyable and easy. My wife is the one who is really sold on it, as she had become frustrated with most of the gadgets I've brought into the house. This one she won't part with!"
0,"Not user friendly, in regards to compatibility with Google Play services, Play Store, etc. Definitely needs to be improved upon"
1,"Other kindle had a hole in screen from kids...upgraded to the paper white screen, works great"
1,"Amazon Echo is really useful with everything it already can do. Currently it is needed as a hands-free device and we use it to control lights, to send emergency phone calls, as an alarm, streaming music player, shopping list, weatherman, and to search the internet. When it can completely control a phone's text and calling capabilities, we'll have everything we need from it."
1,Great device. Sometimes it's hard for it to pick up voice. Good purchase
1,Fast. Plenty of great apps. Nice picture. Lot of fun to use . Highly recommend.
0,Too
1,It is affordable and a great product. Its a great ereader as well as a great tablet. Just the right size to play games and watch movies on.
1,Ease of use and setup 9/10It would be nice if it was out of the box easier to view your own content.
1,I purchased two for my nephew and niece. They love it. My little nephew is having lots of fun taking pictures. Great tablet and affordable price.
1,"Great entertainment devicegood brand, quality and price!"
1,Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!
1,The speaker is a really great convienence device. However my only gripe is that the speakers' sound warps at high volumes if there's a lot of bass.
1,I had purchased the original kindle s few years ago and in December sprang for the new kindle paper white. I thought I might have been wasting money but it is definately an improvement to the original. It's lighter and so much clearer to read from. It's easier to read in dark situations or on flights at night. I love the differences the new improved kindle provides.
0,Amazon account dependent speaker with decent sound
1,This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.
1,"This tablet works well and provides basic app service. It does a great job for what it is intended for,"
1,Does everything it says it does. Great speaker. Good alarm. Bought 3
1,I also own one. They are great easy to. I got my four grand daughters one they love them.
1,"I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money."
1,It's the best choice for $30 to leave home or with friends.
1,"I bought 2 of these tablets as gifts for my nephews, ages 7 and 11. They absolutely love them!"
1,This tablet is perfect for my six year old's learning apps.
1,The best value for the money hands down. Works perfectly.
1,I use to have the Apple tv and I like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation. I have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channels. I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.
1,"Still exploring the possibilities. I bought it as a ""sort of"" addition to my Kindle e-reader. Since I am not a total subscriber to the ""connected lifestyle"" I will be exploring capabilities slowly. My only complaint is the battery life is not (by a factor of (at least) 50) as good as on my KIndle e-reader."
1,Excellent value for the money can not go wrong for the price
1,"We have enjoyed Alexa. She will play songs for us, give us information, and even tell jokes."
1,"Purchased this as a gift for my husband and didn't know what exactly it was all about. Once we installed it and saw all of the things we can watch on it, I was hooked. Very easy to navigate through all of the apps. Considering dropping our cable provider because most of the shows we watch are available through Fire TV. Highly recommend! We will also be purchasing a couple of Firesticks so we can watch in other rooms."
1,I love her...she tells me jokes and tells me the weather and the news...we play games ..she's the bomb
1,"I use it for reading at night in my room, the light makes it great."
1,Now I can read in the bright sun or in the darkness of the night. Love it!
1,Still needs refinement. Works well with some smart home items. But needs to be more consistent. Also follow up questions. Won't just continue with the thought. I feel it's something which may be truly amazing within a year
1,We have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones
1,I am an Apple Fan but I had to see what all the buzz was about with the Amazon FireTV. I decided on the box instead of the stick because it had more memory and could be placed in my cabinet. I mainly wanted to use it with Kodi and it has worked well so far. I also like that it supports 4K streams from Netflix. Setup was very easy and was packaged well similar to the way Apple packages their products.
1,Great gift for a son who has everything and loves technology. His children love asking it questions.
0,"Decent product. It's definitely not for anyone who wants a tablet to stream or play games (other than amazon prime and laggy games) but it's OK for internet browsing and general use. It's on the lowest end of the tablet prices, so you get what you pay for"
0,"This is an ok tablet. We bought it thinking it would be good for travels with our little one, but it's not what we expected. Our little one is able to exit out of movies and apps. There is no way to lock the app when it is in use with little ones. This would be a good tablet for a teenager or adult who wants a tablet but doesn't want to spend a lot of money."
1,I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know
1,"MY GRANDCHILDREN GOT THEIR TABLETS FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEY LOVE THEM, THEY USE THEM AT SCHOOL AND FOR GAMES AND MOVIES AFTER THEIR HOMEWORK IS DONE, VERY EASY TO USE AN PARENTAL CONTROLS ARE GREAT"
1,Use it to listen to the amazon prime music all the time!
1,I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
1,My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.
1,"We ask Alexa questions all day, recently, I received a gift of Amazon Prime, now I have Alexa read my free books while I work around the house! my husband asks weather and ballgame scores."
1,This is a great budget tablet that performs like one 3x as much.
0,"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine."
1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8"" screen. The price was perfect for my budget."
1,New fire has a number of changes over my Kindle fire some easier to use others not so. Overall a very good product t.
1,"FABULOUS HANDS OFF TECHNOLOGY, A MUST IN A BUSY HOUSEHOLD"
1,Researching all of the like products I find that this product best ties in with other sevices i use. I would recommend to my friends and family
1,Got this as a gift for my husband. He loves it! Easy to setup and is a nice piece of equipment. Awesome.
1,I like the amazn tv because it allowes me to watch everyhting using one device
1,"Kindle Paperwhite is great for reading any time, day or night (without needing a light!)... and any where, beach, bed, airplanes. So much more convenient, i.e. better, than carrying a book, or several books!"
1,This is a very responsive device for the amount paid
1,Got this item during a sale and absolutely love it. It is a lot of fun and easy to use.
1,"I had originally bought the Fire Stick to do live streaming and it worked great, but after awhile I decided to upgrade to a faster media box. After a lot of research reading a ton of reviews I decided to get the Fire TV and I'm glad I did. The Fiire TV is works great with my Amazon Prime account, it's much faster especially connected via Ethernet, the memory is expandable, better picture, better wifi, and with the 2gb ram I'm seeing virtually no buffering with playing 1080p content! The remote is a lot better than the original and the voice commands are an added plus. I would definitely with no hesitation recommend getting this if you are Prime Member and want quality streaming. Cheers!"
1,The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
1,I purchased this for my 9 year old niece and she LOVES it. Very kid friendly.
1,We bought it for my son but the whole family uses it. We really enjoy it
1,Loved it very good product. Couldn't ask for anything better.
1,"Great Bang for your Bucks, thats the first thing that comes to your mind, when you hold the tablet. It feels solid, it works great and doesnt feel cheap at all. I have experience, number of low cost tablets and you feel them the moment you hold them, Agree, you cannot compare to iPad mini or other comparable brand tablets. But at this price point, I am not at all hesitant to gift someone. I cant put my head around, how are they able to offer such great quality at this price, simply amazing!!"
1,"Amazon Fire tv is the best box, fast, good interface and simple"
1,No joke I have one on every tv in my house.This unit is so powerful and *customizable.The content of movies and tv shows that you can stream is almost unlimited these days.
1,"It was the cheapest tablet, but still very useful considering it was for my toddler. Wanted something that I could play child shows from youtube and some learning games from apps. Wish there were more apps for him, but I'm sure with time Amazon will have a few more I'd like to see just as Apple does. When not in use, from time to time it works great for the needs I may have if I want a bigger screen than my iPhone or don't feel like booting up a laptop. The only downfall is that when it's locked, it displays ads for games. I found out this is due to keeping the price so low for the tablet."
1,Enjoy playing jeopardy and asking about weather in other locations
1,Easy to set up and lots of fun to use. Gives good info.
1,"It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her."
1,"I got this as a replacement for my daughters kindle. It works much better than the one that came in the box, no idea why but thankful it was sent to me!"
1,We bought the echo and we really enjoy it. It is great for music and much more
1,I love this thing! Awesome for outdoor reading! iPads can't compare. The biggest plus for me is that I'm not bombarded with messages or call and can stay focused on reading.
1,"Was not sure of which was better, but went with the Echo. We are quite pleased and use it all the time. Still learning all the ins and outs, but it is very good."
1,Own a firestick and didn't like the lag so I bought the fire tv. Problem solved. Super smooth. Fast. Responsive.
1,Best FireTV yet. Shows 4k and 1080p content well. Amazon Prime members get extra benefits.
1,"Much nicer than the competition, fast wifi or LAN hookup. The menu is fast and easy to work with. The voice search is helpful and works like Google search or Siri."
1,For an android powered device and no google support it works alright
1,"Better then Apple TV to me. Cause I have an Amazon account. Amazon video, music and all the tv apps. I'm all for this"
1,I purchased this to watch PlayStation Vue which it does very well. It is relatively small and does to make any noise that I can detect.
1,I am a long time Kindle user. I also have a Kindle Fire 8. I keep buying the newer versions because I like the product very much.
1,"Great product, good size for travel. We bought it for our girl, we use it when we travel, and put it on the back seat, so she can see videos or movies"
1,Only few skills were added to Alexa. And When my kids are asking general educational related it is not giving them right answers.
1,You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.
1,my 6 year old granddaughter loves her new tablet. she uses it to play games and download movies.
1,Best bang for your buck for a tablet for a kid to start off with
1,"Wife enjoys the camera feature, but hates all the ads. She'd recommend this to a friend IF they were on a budget."
1,My kids each got one of these tablets for Christmas. They love it. I like how it has parental controls so I can control what apps are on the tablet.
1,"Speaker system for music play is great. Very sensitive to her name ""Alexa"". Make sure to disable voice purchasing or place a code if she will be in a room with a television.. there are lots of commercials where her name is called. She will respond."
1,I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it.
1,Love that I can read inside with the paper white. I replace my originalkindle with this.
1,I use this as a large mp3 player. you can buy a memory card to expand this unit. i put in 128gb card and have put 1000's of songs and still have not use up all the memory unlike my Ipad that fills up fast and has no way of expanding the memory.
1,"It's the amazon version of AppleTv. I guess I expected something a little more ""wow"" for the cost, but it looks like amazon's app on my xbox and smart tv. Not anything super special. It works as intended though and not really any problems. The remote feels flimsy compared to the aluminum of the apple tv gen 1-3"
1,Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.
1,"I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it! You can play games (Although a bit laggy), watch movies/TV shows, read, and do quite a bit with it! The price is amazing! I would for sure buy this again and again! I recommend this if you are wanting a tablet to read! It is a great price for a pretty big screen! (But if you are wanting more of a game tablet I would recommend an Ipad or whatever is at best buy that they recommend.) I definitely think there is enough gigs for a few games and some books! My rating is 10/10!"
1,This is an awesome product. Great for watching shows and movies!
1,Alexa knows all the answers and she's helping us be more efficient as we add light switches and a thermostat
1,"Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads"
1,I don't have cable so it would not be valuable to me
1,"I have bought 5 of these now for kids and for gifts. They are priced right, work well, and are easy to use. If you like your Android phone you will like this tablet"
1,Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can't beat the price!
1,This device really helps my daughter improve in her reading and it is very simple to use.
1,Bought for my daughter because I love mine so much! Easy to use. Can see in the dark to read before bed - not so bright as a phone so it doesn't keep me up.
1,"Even though you need to have a Amazon prime membership to fully exploit the tab , it comes at a very very cheap price."
1,I purchased two. One for my wife and I for a trip to England. Easy to pack-stayed charged-readable in all lighting-we both like them.
1,Light weight easy to take with u . From reading to Facebook for all your little needs
1,I can watch a ton of shows now with this. Well worth the money
1,The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
1,"Love the product, it does everything they say and some really cool other stuff not mentioned. Awesome"
1,"I use my Echo to check on weather and traffic in the morning while getting ready for work. Also enjoy the music selection, news and sports info!!"
1,This was easy to install and is very easy to use. No complaints at all!
1,"I absolutely love this tablet,and with a price you can't beat!"
1,Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He does not do anything too extreme just basic apps. And it handles multiple apps well and for only $50 it was a great value deal. Excellent for games and light activities.
1,"I wanted the charger block with the folding power tines, but not available so I got this one and it works very well and I like it as much as the other type."
1,"The paperwhite allows you to read in any light, from the beach to a quiet night at home."
1,Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
1,"Amazon does it again. Worth every penny spent. Watch all movies, shows. I'm gonna purchase more!"
1,As a tablet compared to others regardless of price I'd score it above average but the other tablets in comparrison cost $100+ more. This is the best buy for your money...hands down as long as you have amazon prime (which is awesome on its own).
1,"You get the most out of this if you have prime. Prime music is great with this, you may want to expand the memory with a card though."
1,"Gift for mom. didn't know if she would use it. Seems to be useful and makes it easy for her to listen to music. Also helps with weather, jokes tend to be corny. Hasn't used it to order anything. Got one for other family members and they seem to use it too."
1,I am pleased with my purchase. I use it daily. Ive downloaded several books. It has good picture quality and excellent sound.
1,"I bought this for my godson and so far he seems to love it. He has downloaded a bunch of games. His mom likes it because it's tied to her account and she was able to set parental controls for specific areas such as movies, etc. I do wish that it came with more than 8 GBs. Just purchased a case and screen protector separately because the kids version is way too much IMO."
1,Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
1,"While I haven't even begun to use all of the functions of the Echo, it has already shown that it is worth the price paid. It is entertaining, convenient, and just plain functional. The quality of the sound is fantastic, and yes, like other reviewers have said, it would be nice if it could be used in conjunction with a subwoofer. Even so, we are satisfied."
1,the back light nad easier to read in all lightings
1,Only regret not buying the larger one but I don't read alot at a time so it will work just fine
1,Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun
1,Had a kindle fire before. Glad I switched. Easy to use and I love being able to read outside in the sun. Battery life is excellent!
0,Its a good tablet for my 6 yr old to play games and watch videos. Only thing is the charger doesnt stay in the port and battery doesnt last long
1,"Bought this for my 9 year old and he absolutely loves it! The free pre installed apps, the High color resolution. The overall quality is great. Unfortunately no Google products are on this tablet and chromecast is not an option (amazon firestick ready). This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5"
1,Still learning but I would like to purchase another one in the near future!!
1,nice product
1,i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great.
1,Works awesome. We are cable free thanks to the Fire tv
1,Very good product. Very useful in mamy scenarios..
1,"Wow, Alexa does it all! I can ask for pretty much anything, and I add new skills for her to learn all the time. It works perfect!"
1,Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.
1,Product serves as reader and simple tablet. Used as personal device when traveling. Good product for the money.
1,Best
1,"Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games."
1,"This is great. Stream all the Prime Video plus your normal stuff on YouTube Netflix, etc."
1,Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.
1,Nice to have around house.May options to using this unit.
1,Alexa is great!!!! I should of bought one so long ago! I am looking to buy a Dot for upstairs now. Provides great sound!
1,"This is a great table for an amazing price! It's perfect for reading books, playing games, checking email, etc. I would definitely reccomend this!"
1,Excellent product I love the back light on my kindle
1,I like that it is lightweight and it has the built in light.
1,Amazon fire tv is a great product save a lot of money not paying high cable prices
0,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
1,My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day
1,"If you're looking for an all-in-one device that can surf the web, read e-books, watch videos, and more....look no further. I purchased this tablet for my daughter and she loves it. The price point is perfect too. It does not have HD or Retina display but it's not an issue for me."
1,Great tablet for reading and playing games. Graphics are great.
1,It was a gift for my 94 year old mother and she was able to learn how to use it fairly quickly.
1,Very pleased with this purchase. I no longer need cable tv service since I purchased this. Easy to set up. Simple remote control.
1,Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful
1,"I love how sturdy it is. It doesn't seem like it would be but it is great. I especially love how when you open it, the screen automatically turns on. I was hesitant at first about the color(Citron), but it looks so much better in person. It does take a flat surface to hold it up, meaning it's hard to use on a couch or bed, but it still works really really well!"
1,"Purchased this for my 5 year old daughter so she could watch cartoons on Netflix. It's very durable, I use it sometimes myself, not a powerful as an iPad mini or galaxy tab but very good for the price."
1,Much better than I expected for such a great price.
1,This is my second fire tablet so I knew that this product would do all I needed plus the newer version had some extras like a camera. Works great for me.
1,The fire TV is excellent and allows me to watch in 4k. Works well.
1,This unit will charge faster than what came with the Amazon Fire HD-8. It's worth it. I can't stand waiting for charging!
1,"The amazon eco is extremely helpful and allows to enjoy numerous things, especially music."
1,Dandy
0,"I use this to read things and purchase items on Amazon. It doesn't play all of my favorite games from the App Store, nor does it sync to my android projector, so I don't really get full use of the larger screen. I think for my uses, I should've just purchased the e-ink version or maybe a full-android version."
1,Love that you can ask anything and she responds right! Great product! Buying another one as we speak!
1,Good charger.
1,My children love their tablets plus they were more affordable than kid tablets. I just purchased a child proof case and downloaded the games they play. Totally worth it!
1,"Very nice tablet. Easy to use, screen is very bright and clear. Nice tablet for the money!"
1,"I bought on sale for $35. My sister recommended Kindle tablets because of the text to speech feature. Some kindle ebooks have a text to speech feature. You can start reading at home then turn on text to speech fir when you are in the car stuck in traffic. We have a prime membership and you can save Amazon videos to watch offline. I haven't tried this yet but sounds great for plane or bus travel. You camn download the Overdrive app directly for free books, audio books,and video. I plan to download the Nook app so I can read Overdrive magazines and my Nook books. Micro sd slot for additional storage. Only mono sound which is fine for what I want to use it for. Cheap enough that I'll let the grandkids use it."
1,This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier
1,Easy to setup. My wife enjoys listening to Christian music while working. It has been a great buy!
1,"This was not a necessary product for my family, but we sure are having fun with it. At first I think my 7 year old thought we were talking through a microphone to a real person. He understands now that Alexa is not real, but he sure has fun asking questions and making requests. Overall, Alexa is really good at answering, and my whole family enjoys having her around. Hopefully there's not someone listening to everything that goes on in my house.:)"
1,"I became a fan of ""Alexa"" from Day 1. I play my favorite music, use the alarm, check news and weather and even ask Alexa to ""tell me a joke!"". One of my best birthday presents!"
1,Very similar to the fire stick but it seems a bit faster when downloading.
1,"I was using Nook glow light, migrating to paper white has been the bestKindle store provides plenty of books compared to nookBattery life is excellent , will last 2-3 weeks without recharging with daily use of 2 hours"
1,Works perfectly user friendly and has voice recognition. Don't waste money on a roku or nexus player. Definitely worth the money. Can do 4k and even non 4k much better picture quality.
1,"Gotta say, I love this silly thing! Total light show, PLUS so much more!"
1,It is a good product - enjoying more options for movies
1,I bought this for my Grandkids and they absolutely love them.
1,great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity
1,"Unless I'm not using it right, I can't voice search within apps outside of the amazon realm. Other than that, pretty sweet setup."
1,It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.
1,I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.
1,Perfect tablet for my 7 year old girl. She really enjoys it.
1,The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price
1,"Great product, and it moves faster than the firesticks."
1,"Love my kindle paperwhite! Take it everywhere! Light enough to hold or carry, fits in most purses. Can read outside in bright sunlight, has built in adjustable backlight for reading in bed & not disturbing yourbedmate. Lots of storage & battery life is excellent. Highly recommend for purchase if you are looking for a black & white reader only!"
1,Way faster then the stick. And better quality. Worth the extra money. Especially for kodi
1,Like the fact that this unit now includes Alexa. Hope that more Apps are available soon (seems Roku has a few that this one doesn't).
1,Great tablet for messing around with or just to have.
1,Amazon has done a good job but the reader is still a little on the small size for my liking. The light is a key feature for night readers. Interface is well laid out. Purchased for a family member who is happy with it.
1,"I really like it, I can see the letters perfectly and it has a perfect size"
1,My wife loves this. the paperwhite is the way to go!
1,"I've had a couple different Kindles & have also tried to read books on my iPad & phone. LOVE the Kindle Paperwhite. You can read it outside in the sun, by the pool, on your deck etc... & the print is always clear & visible. The battery stays charged for several days & it's small size makes it easy to carry in your purse or tote bag!"
1,Excellent for reading and has lots of other uses with wifi
1,"I love how clear the screen is and no glare, it's amazing"
1,"Run this with EMBY client and it works awesome. Love that it plays h265 no problem, one of the few that can actually do it. Highly recommend. ALOT FASTER than the stick in my opinion."
1,"I love how easy the Kindle is to operate. It is very intuitive, and requires only a short learning curve. Also it is one of the most economical ways to read books."
1,"This was a gift for my 7 year old granddaughter, so I have no input for this product.She seems happy with it."
1,The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
1,"My first tablet! I was surprised it's just like my Samsung phone, and actually can sync programs and data with it. The wireless is great; I have no need for cell capabilities. It would be more power usage to search for cell, and most places I can use wi-fi. I use it as an alternative Kindle reader with the Kindle app. I also was amazed to find a free Microsoft Office Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, etc, although I haven't used them. This Tab A is sometimes kind of slow, but it was about $100 on sale, and great for the price. Very versatile. I'm very happy with it. I haven't needed extra memory yet, but good to know I can expand it with a microSD card."
1,Upgraded to voice controlled remot from the original fire tv. Love it. Don't think I even need to keep cable!!
1,Best Buy always has the lowest competitive pricing and great availability
1,We found this to be an excellent music source. Signed up for the $3/month Unlimited Amazon Music subscription. It's great to be able to request any kind of music at any time. Speaker quality is excellent as well. It was very easy to setup. Love that you can add items directly to a shopping list or a to do list. I would have given this 5 stars if the Search feature was more robust.
1,The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.
1,I bought this for my Mom. She is 83 yrs old. She wanted it to put the Bible on it. She loves it's!
1,Fantastic gadget for reading. Excellent quality and the right price!
0,It's a great for reading books but it's not that great when it comes to everything else.
1,Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
1,Awesome product like the layout used Roku in the past I really like this one way more than the Roku
1,My previous Kindle did not have the backlight so I upgraded to the Paperwhite in order to be able to read wherever I happened to be.
0,"I mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. Great for social media as well. A perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. Definitely buy a decent sized micro SD card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 GB because the OS takes so much space on the device."
1,"This tablet is a great, all-in-one device. It does everything my husband (and my three children, and myself) need. This was the fifth Fire I've purchased in the last 3 years."
1,Fantastic for reading in dark conditions. Very light and easy to hold.
1,Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family
1,I was looking for something basic to read on before bed and this fit the bill perfectly. Bonus it has camera lol
1,I purchased this tablet for my 5 year old. It is easy to use and i love the Kindle Freetime. Great price. Pretty durable.
1,"Alexa helps so much any questions answered turn off and on lights. I have an echo in every room your favorite stations artist songs all by asking Alexa. Ask for news, weather, alerts, notifications and anything you want. Alexa is part of the family now."
1,My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.
1,So far the Alexa Echo is very easy to use. I like the media and Amazon order follow up features best.
1,"Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it. Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising."
1,It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.
1,This item is a thing of the future. You can littetly operate you wireless components using this debice.
1,Great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable Tv
1,its a great great gift that can be used by everyone
1,"Not an exact fit in our house , but an excellent speaker . Worth learning to use ."
1,Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly
1,"I got it for my daughter who really loves it, it is very easy to use"
1,"Great tablet for beginners, nice and simple. Great price"
1,Good product.
1,Perfect for my 10 years old daughter. She loves it and that makes me happy.
1,"amazing deal, quick and fast menus, and 4k! cant be beat"
1,"I wanted this tablet for reading books, checking e-ail and playing the occasional game. It works very well. I have also found the camera very convenient."
1,"Nice way to stream movies, ......................."
1,"Nothing will replace the joy of flipping through the pages of a book, but living in a studio apartment with my girlfriend, I simply don't have the space for all the books I'd like to own on top of the ones I have now.I got this for my girlfriend because she has difficulty reading on my iPad Air. She has no difficulty using her Kindle Voyage, and she thoroughly enjoys it.I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself farther down the line."
1,"I'm not a huge fan of the modified Android interface on this tablet, and it is FAR from the best tablet on the market. Not even close. But I am giving it 5 stars based on its value. It is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera AND a microSD slot for cheap, easy, expandable storage. Throw in the excellent integration with the Amazon ecosystem (if you use that) and you have a very worthwhile device. If you are not a big Amazon user, I don't think it has as much to offer, but it is still nice for an ultra-low-budget tablet."
1,I got this for $33 on Black Friday. Does what I need to do.
1,"I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
1,Really good small tablet. Small and very convenient. Great visual quality.
1,"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."
1,I m pleased with Echo disappointed that it came late
1,Great learning tool and tough exterior makes it the PERFECT gift for a three year old.
1,"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
1,bought it for my niece and she loved it she was super happy
1,"I absolutely love Alexa, she can now play from my iTunes library when connected to my phone via Bluetooth. She is remarkable and I would choose Alexa over google voice."
1,"I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV for use in a spare room. I subscribe to various platforms including Netflix and Playstation Vue. Although I am on a wireless connection, playback has been smooth, with almost no glitches. Not to mention, the picture quality has been superb (this can vary depending on the bandwidth of your internet connection). Setup was a breeze and it is very intuitive; so much so, that my 9 year old can use it with no problems (and after applying parental controls of course)."
1,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it
1,"I LOVE my Paperwhite Kindle. The convenience of this product speaks for itself. I can read and purchase books anywhere, anytime.When my husband bought me my first Kindle 9-10 years ago, I opened it up and wasn't too sure I was going to like it. Boy was I wrong! I will never go back to books. Best product ever, well worth the money."
1,Great purchase! We use the Echo for playing a lot of music. The sound quality is really sharp.
1,Perfect gift for my mother and mother in law. Easy to use wonderful graphicsAwesome tablet
1,"This was purchased for my grandson for Christmas, he is so in love with it, Great price and quality. Will probably get another grandchild one."
1,"This is the best steaming device, to run many additional applications that will run smoothly."
1,"I got this as an upgrade for my old kindle & I love the new features! Crisp clear picture, easy to find app locations & tabs. Well organized. They added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. When reading it learns your pace & gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which I think is neat. Can watch Netflix/Hulu. All around great product in my opinion."
0,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
1,"My son loves his tablet, easy access to the Internet and download games."
1,Love my tablet for the price I paidWill buy again .
1,"Its so small its easy to get lost under your TV! Its very fast, and easy to use. Log in to your amazon account and Netflix and Hulu and you have tons of options right at your fingertips!Have not really used alexa all that much so not sure how well it works overall. The phone app remote works pretty well so that is nice when you cant find the tiny fire TV remote/ too lazy to look for it! :) Some of the apps do not work all that great/ don't utilize surround sound but the main ones do. Got it on sale for $85. Definitely worth this price!"
1,Set up was easy. Alexa so far has been on target and extremely helpful.
1,"Great product for the price. Whether it be for reading, playing games or surfing the web. Easy to use, good for all ages."
1,We had purchased this for our daughter. The parental control/profile features are great for her. Totally recommend!
1,got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him.
0,Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
1,"I love it! I gave it as a gift to my grandchildren, and they love it! We communicate through messages."
1,"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
1,This tablet is great because you don't need a data plan but you can do anything that any other tablet can do maybe even a bit more. The only restriction is you need Wi-Fi to run it but let's face it Wi-Fi is everywhere now.
1,"Easy set up, and simple to learn various functions, including controlling wifi devices in my home."
1,My daughter picked this tablet after her HD Fire battery would no longer work. The insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the HD. She wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. She loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.
1,Love the shopping app! Just tell Alexa to add an item and it goes to your phone! You never forget to take your shopping list again
1,A welcome addition to online streaming. Easy menu and controls for navigation.No buffering issues noticed.
1,It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.
1,I would recommend to family and friends. I love it.
1,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday..."
1,"So far so good,no problems and would recommend to everyone. Has crisp clear pictures and easy to navigate around without help or instruction manual."
1,This product is great and easy to use. It's an all in one entertainment product .
1,"I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and she loves it. She uses it everyday. The paper white version is fantastic. There is no glare, it doesn't get too bright if the room is dark, and she uses it outside as well as in the car all the time with no screen issues! This device has been charged once and that was when we first got it. She hasn't had to charge it in over a month. Highly recommend!!!"
1,Bought this for a xmas present but heard it play when a good friend bought it. Was very impressed with it's technology. I recommended it to another friend and she bought it for her daughter.
1,I absolutely love my fire tv it is amazing for everything
1,"I brought this for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it. She use it to do homework on, play games, watch videos. She loves it."
1,"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase"
1,bought for my 5 yr old. He cant put it down. lots of educational apps.
1,"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!"
1,"Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect reader. It's small size fits into a purse or carry all, and the light weight makes it very easy to hold. The response time when buying books is very fast. It is the perfect addition to the Kindle family. I also recommend purchasing the leather cover."
1,It is Great I Love It Got Rid Of Cable With The Fire Tv .
1,"After having been an Apple TV user (the older versions, of which I have 2) I decided to go with the amazon product because this one supports fox sports. That's the only reason I chose it. But after using it I have no complaints at all. I haven't yet looked into streaming from mobile device to it yet, not sure if it's possible or not. Either way I'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy one of these devices."
1,"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
1,She started using it the same day and reads books every day now.
1,Easy setup nice size only thing is the charger cords need to be more sturdy.
1,This is a wonderful tablet. The processor is fast. I'm able to watch movies with no buffering. Tons of apps. This is an excellent value!
1,My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
1,"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
0,"this item was on a hefty sale, bought two for work purposes. a bit slow and annoyed by the constant Amazon notifications / integrations but it will work for the purpose of check emails and viewing photos."
1,I got this for my wife and she loves it. Screen is easy to read indoors and out.
1,I guess since I'm saying that this is perfect for reading 4 stars seems cheeky. It's just that since I'm used used using a tablet which is definitely faster but at least I can read anywhere and there is no glare from the sun and it's not too bright which helps with eyestrain.
1,"Wife likes it, and I can sleep at night without the room getting lit up."
1,"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
1,This tablet is inexpensive and user friendly for my toddler. He loves it and uses great educational apps.
0,"I didnt realize, even though I should have, that I could not add whatever programs I wanted to for it. I wanted to get this so I could play games on the tablet while home, instead of my phone. I was able to install one of the two games I play, but was unable to with the second. I will actually be returning it because that means I have no use for it. My wife has one and hers has been great for her this entire time."
1,"Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box. Have not had any of the same problems. Saving over $100 a month cutting out cable. So paid for itself, definitely a great decision."
1,My daughter has enjoyed it very much!!!! She loves using the camera. And playing the games she just loves it. We have to put it on charge and she is asking 5 minutes later is it charged yet!!!! Really is kid friendly
1,The kindle paperwhite is absolutely a perfection. It is perfect for just picking up a book and instantly starting where you left off. The lighting is so realistic it feels like you're just reading real paper. Definitely a bargain.
1,"I have an Echo or an Echo Dot in almost every room in my house! The Echo has incredible sound for such a small device. The Echo Dot is not that hot as a speaker, but both of them work great for controlling your other smart home devices. I personally have it set up to control my Hue lights, my Schlage Connect lock (with a Wink Hub), and my Logitech Harmony Hub to control my entertainment system! Fantastic buy!"
1,She was so excited to receive it and likes that she can read it outside in the sun or inside in the dark. Big improvement over the original Kindle which I also gave her.
1,I love the price of this product. And for the price it gives you Big Bang for the buck. My wife does not use electronics and she has no problem using this.
1,"I bought two one for my son and one for me. Great tablet, at a reasonable price."
1,I love it. Quick for information and have started converting components in the house to smart home setup.
0,Could not get this to work with my chromecast so I returned it.
1,"I love, love, love this Kindle Fire 7. I Like the size, the quality and most especially, the price. This product greatly exceeded my expectations. I use it every day. I recommend this Kindle Fire 7 to anyone who is thinking of buying a Kindle Fire. I am telling all of my friends about it!"
1,Great little tablet. Bought for my neice to mess around on. Does everything the expensive ones do for a fraction of the cost.
1,I will definitely purchase another tablet a larger size for me at a different time.
1,"Talk to Echo to tun on my lights, and set timers all the time"
1,"Compared to the Galaxy kids tablet, this was a better deal and more durable for children below 12 yrs. old."
1,I think this product works good. I would recommend it.
1,this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
1,"The Amazon Echo was easy to setup straight out of the box, and my family began using it immediately. We are learning new things it can do every week. The sound quality is amazing, and this has become the primary music source for my house. When purchasing, I would have preferred a black Echo, but white is all this Best Buy had at the time (before Xmas), but white looks very clean on our kitchen counter where it sits. There are some words Alexa is still struggling with understanding, but we do have a bit of a Texas drawl, so I think we're getting used to each other."
1,"She understand almost everything, she is quickly to respond and you can actually synchronize your fire stick with it as well"
1,I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.
1,"Great tablet for beginner, especially with wifi function and ebook purposes"
1,The Amazon Echo is very easy to set up and is very useful. It is also fun to use. I keep learning new things it can do on a daily basis.
1,This product is excellent for what we need.....only internet!
1,This is by far the best kindle to come out. Backlight is great!!
1,so far so good I own this for almost a year and no freeze when Im watching a movie via stream
1,so easy to set up. great App selection. should have purchased this sooner.
1,I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
1,Easy to set up and very functional. Definitely would buy again as a gift
1,Fine quality. I love the options available with the Amazon Fire tv.
1,"We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better."
1,Great price for an awesome tablet. Awesome tablet to read my books.
0,I prefer apple products myself. But this is perfect for children
1,"Was very easy to set up and use, has been a joy to just ask Alexa to play my favorite music and even tell jokes! Highly recommend this product!"
1,"Very easy for my child to navigate. It was very easy to set it up. All the games, books and internet that's pre-loaded is awesome and so convenient"
0,I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.
0,Has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but I guess that's only my opinion
1,Very easy to setup and even more importantly easy to use.
1,I bought two of this tablets and they are great tablets with the best prize in the market.
1,"excellent device, very fast especially when connected to ethernet"
1,Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile!
1,The kindle fires have been great for the grandbabies.
1,I bought this item as a gift and I've heard great things about the paper white Kindle. I'm thinking about getting one myself!
1,Recognizes all commands as long as you speak clearly and there are no other noises. Works like Siri your personal assistant.
1,"The reader is great, with a crisp display and excellent battery life. I like having the option of either using the buttons to flip pages, or just swipe it. The latter always required two hands, so the buttons can make it easier."
1,Buy a heavy duty screen protector had ours less than a month glass is shattered unable to find a place to fix it .. Do not buy this for kids grandson is 11 ...
1,"This is a great product, that doesn't have a lot of distraction for kids. Great little reader for the price"
1,"this is a great tablet at a great price. unfortunately it can't connect to google play without hacking. if that's what you need, look at the acer tablet. if you are looking for an inexpensive fire tablet, you can't go wrong with this."
1,"Unbelievable! Everyone should get one! I wasn't sure if use it, but I do all of the time."
1,Was looking for streaming device. Weren't sure if I want to pay $100 for 1 but it was on sale for $70 so decide to buy it. Did research and found it allow me to install dev app to connect to other server source for streaming so bought it instead of roku or apple.
1,Easy to work no issues my daughter loves it and my 6 year old loves it too
1,"This is my third kindle, and I am thrilled with the new display! Money well spent"
1,"Lightweight, easy on the eyes, easy to use, many wonderful features"
1,"I dumped cable after using streaming and Playstation Vue. I have one Fire TV in my bedroom and loved it so I bought a Fire Stick for downstairs. The Fire Stick was slow by comparison, so I upgraded and have no issues with the Fire TV. The Fire TV is worth the extra money. The variety of services offered and the speed pays off if you have a good connection. I do not have 4K, but I can only assume it will be a quality stream when I do."
1,"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
0,"Its a good tablet with very nice screen and functions. As with amazon fire tablets , you are stuck with apps on amazon and you may not get too many variety and good quality apps. If you are ok with Amazon apps, this is a fine nice tablet.. If you need good and verities of apps, go for android tablet."
1,"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool."
1,"In process of comparing the Amazon Echo to the Google Home. So far the Echo has a leg up as it plays music that I get ""free"" from my Amazon Prime membership - would recommend this product to others"
1,"There is so much to do with the Echo, that I am still getting to know it. Everyday, I learn and try a new skill. Great device, great price!"
1,Wait for to be on sale it's worth it definitely you will love it
1,This is pretty good. A little expensive but work fine.
1,I love this item because I just love all electronics
0,very good just don't forget to ask for the none promo one
1,"The sound from this unit is just incredible and with almost 20 million songs for $3.99 to $7.99 a month depending on the Amazon plan, it just doesn't get any better. Add in the fact it controls all the lights in my home, my Samsung robot vacuum and can answer almost any question I ask her, it is hard to imagine life without my Alexa..."
1,This product was for a 13 year old and it was perfect for his needs at a great price
1,Amazing deal for solidly built tablet. If you're looking for some thing basic this is the one
1,"Love it, it's very easy to use and great for travel!"
1,"We are having a blast with Alexa, eventually we will grow our Alexa's family...i.e.: lights, tv... we are becoming so lazy... wish she would clean the house too... :)))"
1,"This tablet is a great deal! Simple to use, my son loves having access to all his favorite shows and games without having to ask to use my phone."
0,Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
1,I am so glad i procrastinated in buying an e-reader.I was going to get the kindle paperwhite- then the Voyage came out- I bought it and am so happy with it- a joy to use.
1,"The screen is cool. Much better than the basic kindle. Very similar to the kindle voyage. If you want a really reading experience, you need a kindle."
1,if you want to have multiple apps this is what to get
1,Bought extra for a gift. Plan to give it for a Christmas present.
1,you can not fail on Amazon. I primarily use for reading books and watching prime video without any problem. Love this little thing!
1,Its a tablet under 50$ that performs well and is reliable. A must have.
1,"My son loves this tablet. I would recommend for kids under teenage age. Great display, not much storage but can add SD card."
1,Really enjoying our Amazon Echo. Have programmed lights and am looking forward to other things.
1,"This is my second Amazon Fire, purchased it from Best Buy for a Christmas gift, when a deal was running. After opening the package found a scratch on the screen. Took the product to Store Best Buy changed it promptly. The new one is quiet right."
1,"I also have a Nook Glow but I miss having buttons. The ""squeeze the edge"" for a page turn is what sold me."
1,It protects my Kindall and I can take it and put it in my purse if not get scratch because I like to read my Kimball we have places waiting for people. And it's a nice color and it's very nice.
1,"Very pleased with the performance. Thought i would miss turning pages, but I don't. Some may prefer a larger screen. I would buy again."
1,Kindle does everything as advertised. Easy on the eyes and great in sunlight.
1,This is the 2nd Fire I purchased. Had to return the first due to a flaw creating an inability to connect to wifi. So far this one works great. Use it mostly for reading.
1,Main reason for getting the Amazon TV was for better streaming experience of PlayStation Vue. The Amazon Fire TV handles Vue streaming w/o issues and the interface is very easy and user friendly. I also like the ability to root the device for third party apps.
1,This kindle paper white is an excellent choice for reading on the beach or in sunlight
1,"this is great, really easy to use - the playlists are fantastic"
1,I love this product it very great for my son. My son educational apps on here
0,It would be nice if there were more interaction with Home Entertainment Deivices. Only purchased because works with Harmony Remote.
1,"Gave it as a gift, but my father absolutely loves it. he had been using one of the old Kindle DX readers."
1,We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
1,Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.
1,"Was hoping the screen a little bigger, but over all great picture, easy to use"
1,Amazing value for money tablet !!!Best in this price point.Got it for 39$ on sale from Brst Buy.Solid built and quite a rugged product.
1,Easy to use and integrate with Nest and Philips Hue. I like that new features seem to be added frequently.
1,Bought it for a gift for our 21 year old daughter. She wanted a speaker and then decided on this. Her roommates LOVE it! She likes the white.
0,It takes practice and getting familiar with it. It is fun.
1,"Love it! I use it for weather, Pandora, you can play games and ask it recipes. It's great."
1,I purchased this for my wife for her birthday. She loves it.
1,"I have had several Kindles beginning with the 1st generation. I am an avid reader and I love that I can take my library with me. The Kindle Voyage is by far my favorite. The printed page is very clear and the lit page is wonderful. If you enjoy reading as much as I do, this is the e-reader for you."
1,This item is ok if your not looking for a big name brand tablet.
1,"Good tablet for adult, it is great when installing xbmc/kodi and stream vidoes online"
1,This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it
1,"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
1,"Amazon Fire is perfect for families on the go! It fits well into backpacks, purses and briefcases!"
0,Sadly no having netflix support is resulting in my last tablet purchase from Amazon.
1,"I like this Kindle, but I am not sure it is worth the premium over the Paperwhite. I previously had a Kindle Fire, which was fine, but this is definitely nicer for reading. But it all depends on what you need it for, and how often you will use it."
1,This is much better than an iPad or Android tablet for reading. Can't go wrong!
1,"This is great toy. You may not need it, but you'll want it, and love it when you start using it."
1,This tablet has grt performance and good camera and long backup. 2 year warranty make lifw more easy for parent's.
1,kids love the tablet & the picture quality is good
1,We bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them. Nice prenatal features to limit use and restrict content in the Amazon eco system. Build quality seems good. Glad we choose these over the cheaper brand that was only a few bucks less.
1,I really enjoy using the Fire 7 tablet. It is light weight and fits in my purse for caring around. Now I always have a good book to read.
1,Works great for everyday use. The family loves it.
1,"If you haven't bought one of these already, I suggest you do so. You won't be disappointed."
1,"We got this on a one-day special and took a chance. I would say that Alexa generally works better than Siri on most things and more consistently. The speaker alone is good, but the ability to play radio via TuneIN, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc. is value enough...beyond the little things like saying ""Alexa, set a timer for 4 minutes"" or ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?"". Overall very impressed with the Echo - recommended highly."
1,Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.
1,"OK, let's face it. Kindles are not the fastest nor do they come with a quad core processor. But they are great for simple reading and light web browsing. But for 39.99 on sale it was a steal. Thanks Best Buy!"
1,When I was looking for something to get so I could have all my books on one the Kindle is the first thing I thought of and ended up getting. The only thing I don't like about it is when it is dark the screen can be kind of bright even with the blue shade on. I also I have trouble spelling on the keyboard.
1,"Love this device. I have a 16 month old that is hard set to get to nap and go to bed. Currently still on a vacation, and have been very pleased with the ease of putting on Sesame Street on the hotel tv via hbogo. no little tablet or phone needed, and has perfect picture quality"
1,The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
1,"LOVE IT VERY GOOD IDEM,Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY"
1,My granddaughter loves this tablet. Best tablet for the money.
1,"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
1,I purchased this kindle to replace one I had for several years. So far it has preformed great. Easy to use and holds a charge well.
1,This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do
1,"I have been very hesitant of cutting that cable cord, but I decided to buy the Amazon Fire TV and test it out. I cut the cable cord the next day. Well worth the purchase and the savings from not having cable tv."
1,"We got the new Amazon fire TV as we got a new 4K tv. Right now there is still not as much 4K content as I would like, however it does 4K very well. Netflix and Amazon prime have a few 4K tv shows and movies that are available if you have a 4K tv, but the New Fire TV also has upgraded internals and faster wireless making everything much snappier. I would recommend a wired connection if you can, streaming will look much better and pause much less often."
0,"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably."
1,I am amazed by the touch quality and the feel of the page turning.
1,"I've bought kindles before so we were already familiar with the product. It works just as great as the other ones and is a nice little size. Picture is better on our other ones, but that's because the other ones are HD. Great purchase for a great price!"
1,"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain."
1,I love my purchase Would recommend it to my friends
1,Purchased for my 5 year old son and he loves it to
1,"What a great product! Easy to set up and a great ""assistant""!"
1,"Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up."
1,Love the silver color and larger screen also easy to navigate
1,Works like it should. Got it to watch Amazon and Netflix.
1,"Works great, but requires Amazon prime or Spotify premium accounts to work best."
1,Home automation is right around the corner with the Amazon Echo. Great companion....period.
1,This tablet stands head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to proportion of price/quality. Amazon continues to improve upon its quality.
1,"We love our Echo. Music, news, and basic info! It is great!"
1,His streaming device is awesome. So much better than my roku. Options options options is all I have to say
1,"This is an inexpensive alternative to a tablet and larger than a phone. The memory is small at 8 GB, but can be expanded with a micro SD card. Plus you are not slowed down by constant Windows 10 downloads."
1,"For the price, the Kindle Paperwhite was a great upgrade to the old Kindle. The back light was a plus when using on a plane, and the charged lasted throughout the two week trip."

1,I have been a book fan and was surprised how much I love this.
1,"I bought this to replace an aging Apple TV and have been very pleasantly surprised with it. It streams in 4k, which my Apple TV did not do, and I have Kodi installed to stream media from a home server to my TV. Great product and worth the money!"
1,This product is really cool and fun to have. Hooked from day one.
1,This is a nice budget tablet especially as a starter tablet.
0,Got this because it was on sale and I had a gift card. It is extremely slow using the internet. Hoping to be using it was an e-reader.
1,For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
1,"This is a great new product. Speaker sound quality it pretty good, and I love being able to stream music without a phone or tablet. It can tell you the news and weather and is learning new functions all the time. I think this is the wave of the future. It is nice having my own personal assistant around the house...now only if it could make me breakfast."
1,"Works great. Nice upgrade over the Fire stick as it has an Ethernet port. Heavily focused on Amazon content (duh) but if you have a Prime account, this is a must."
1,"I bought this product to replace my nvidia sheild. I'm glad that I did. I have noticed that while streaming video that buffering is almost non existent. In my opinion, this is the best platform available for running the Kodi app."
0,It's an alright tablet for my parents to learn and use for Skype
1,I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.
1,enjoying this tablet. purchased so I could have a bigger screen for shopping when I don't wanna pull my laptop out. so far it is serving the purpose. didn't know it came in colors until I opened it.
1,the size is perfect ....the battery excellent ....got it on a sale .....love it
1,My wife has enjoyed this tablet a lot. She plays a lot of card games and looks up recipe.
1,I bought this for my 79 year old mother. It works great and provides some info as well as entertainment. I wish it could dial her iPhone for her. Maybe next version...
1,"So in reading the reviews before I got this cover I was quite worried... lots of people reported it feeling cheap, flimsy, overpriced etc. I was so concerned in fact I tried to cancel my order. I'm glad I wasn't able to.It is perhaps not what people expect- the leather is not soft, but is rather pressed and almost polished. However, this cover does NOT feel cheap to me. It is stylish, super light, and fits the kindle without those annoying elastic loops or hooks on the corners. It fits within a rubberized groove on the cover, which not only gives it a very tight and secure fit, it also adds protection to the corners of the device and cover. It also feels quite secure in the hand.So, to sum up: Light, secure, well made and unobtrusive. The 40 price tag could be debated, but I actually don't find it to be overpriced. I'm quite happy with it!"
1,My mom is 89 and has a hard time with technology. This Kindle is simple and easy for her to use. It has fulfilled all of her basic needs.
1,"Bought this as a christmas gift for a family member, I've heard nothing but good things about it. Great little tablet for a great price."
1,"Bought this tablet for my mom as a birthday day gift. She loves it. This is her first tablet and shes learning how to use it. I was very impressed with how quick and responsive it was. Also it has an excellent display and runs just like 200+ tablets, Will play all your favorite apps."
1,Setting up the Echo was very easy. That is good since I am not very tech savy. Love it.
1,Amazing. Works well. Everything runs quick and smooth and good price.
1,My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!
1,Great Item everyone should keep purchasing from best buy
1,"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
1,The kids have really enjoyed playing on their new tablets!
1,I would highly recommend this product. It's speaker is very good and you can ask it a lot of question s and she will usually have the answer.
0,"I really like the features, the size, and the price, but I was a bit disappointed with the lack of speed!"
1,"This was a gift for my son, who loves this tablet. It's easy to use, set up parental settings, and seems durable."
1,"This is an amazing tablet for the value price. It has gone beyond my expectations. These operate fast and efficiently. The screen clarity is excellent. Photos aren't as clear as they could be, but for the price they are wonderful. These are an excellent purchase!"
1,I have slowly started to smartify my house. Alexa does great with the smart switches and plugs I have in the house. It makes it very convenient when you have your hand full when first getting home.
1,This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books
1,"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining"
1,Bought this for our 9 year old daughter and she loves it! Easy to use and kid friendly.
1,"Awesome to have, verry convient. I would like to have one in every room."
1,"I was hesitant in buying one of these but I took the risk and the risk paid off. It's an amazing piece of hardware in a little box, not to mention a stylish box. If your looking for a streaming box? Look no further!"
0,Review is based on the fact that I have not able to make a connection with the device.
1,"I was surprised at how much I like this amazon fire tv. I own a Apple TV and a roku. I really like it because I have amazon prime and amazon unlimited music and this really makes those services shine! It's nice to watch the prime provided content, movies, tv shows, and amazon original series. The Alexa inabled remote is also very nice."
1,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! I love the free time app.
0,I had a hard time trying to work this it could not understand me most of the time everything seem to be hard to work for me.
1,"I bought this for my gran as a Christmas gift. She plays games on it all day, checks her Facebook and loves it. Super easy to use. If she can anyone can."
1,"I was hesitant to get a tablet because I was unsure as to how it works and adding a new technology can sometimes be challenging. The Best Buy rep directed me to the Amazon Fire for it's ease of use and he was spot on. Also, the email ""introducing"" me to my tablet was invaluable and helped me immensely. A nice addition to the helpfulness of staff at your store."
1,Easy too use and a plus for wife to read books being a prime member
0,"Great if you read alot of magazines, books or plan to spend alot of $ for music and stuff...most aps arnt available like google play store"
1,Decent and simple tablet that gets the job done.Excellent!
0,Good for the price. Ended up returning it for the model up that had some extra features.
1,"Great for my one year old baby,he loves to play games and watch movies.."
1,It is easy & flexible to use. Much less expensive than other tablets.
1,Bought a fire TV player to replace an aging PS3. Works as advertised. Alexia can be a little quirky at times however.
0,I bought this for travel so I can read as much as I can without bartering and carrying books. It's easy to read but the size doesn't work for me. I have to hold it with two hands. I was hoping I could hold it in one. In retrospect I would get the Amazon Fire instead.
1,"Very fun and entertaining, works with my hopper 3 through Dish and my ecobee 3 thermostat"
1,"I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc."
1,"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
1,"I like my new amazon fire. Great price for a tablet. I choose it for my daughter Christmas gift. Since she is 7 years old, she need to study a lot on some apps her school required. She love play apps games too. It's a must."
1,So far this product has worked great. I bought it to replace my kindle charger that was no longer charging my older kindle fire. I bought a new USB cord as well. It charges my kindle so much faster than any of the other chargers I have. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,For the money you just can't beat this little tablet!! I have used it quite heavily! I used it during a trip I took and had to rely on it while my computer was in the shop for over a week and it has performed beautifully!! I would recommend this product to anyone!!
1,"Very easy setup. Works every time. I have my lights, AC and TV controlled by the echo."
1,"I'm enjoying my amazon fire. I've been reading great books, checking my e-mail and shopping.I highly recommend this product..value great quality great.You won't be disappointed."
1,"I had one, it was a gift. When it broke down I wanted another one. So I bought this one."
1,Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children.
1,Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
1,You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
1,Bought for drivers to log into peoplenet for work. Very easy to navigate. We luv it
1,"This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all."
1,"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
1,They are the best choice for everybody in the family i bought for my family and they truly live it and it was a great supper dooper deal.
1,Great tablet for kids of any age. It's cheap and user friendly. You can even set controls so there is an age timer as well. It's perfect!
1,This is better then the fire stick much faster streaming less lag
1,very easy to use. was bought to use with Kindle. happy with my purchase!!
1,last year I bought three for my older grand kids this year I bought one for the younger one and they all love it.
1,Got it for my son. He loves everything about it & likes that it even fits in most of his jean pockets.
1,The echo has a great sound for a small product. The convenience alone makes this a worthwhile purchase.
1,Amazon Products are easy to use and navigate thru.
1,Brought this for my daughter she loves it. Really like that she can make her own profile for all her pbs kids and Disney jr apps.
1,This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
1,"Very useful,Very handy.Best when you travel due to prtability"
1,Compared these headphones to beats. Satisfied with the purchase!
1,It is a good inexpensive tablet. It lags occasionally but is great for something to watch movies or television while waiting for an appointment or anywhere with free wifi.
1,Streams much better than smart tv does. Well worth it
1,interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
1,At first I didn't understand all the hype about Alexa. But then I finally gave in and decided to purchase. And I am so glad I did. Volume goes loud and she listens and responds immediately.
1,I own 3 in my household. To me no other streaming box comes close. A definite must buy !
1,The Amazon Fire is a very good tablet that is very user friendly and the price is great.
1,Always learning new stuff. This tech toy is very useful.
1,"This e-reader does not strain my eyes and works great in any lighting, including full sun."
1,My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
1,"If your familiar with Echo, you know what you're going to get. Alexa does not have all the answers however. Price is pretty much the same everywhere."
1,"I bring it with me every where. I read my books on it, surf the web, and play my favorite games on it."
1,"I got this as a gift for my friend. It has a nice sleek look to it. You have to have the app to access all of its features, but overall it's fun to use.My only complaint is it needs to be consistently plugged in. It would be nice if it had a long lasting battery that would allow us to place it where we want, but aside from that. It's been fun"
1,"Clear, easy to use, easy to read, This is my 2nd paperwhite & would buy again."
1,"For the price, this tablet is great! Does what is needed and its sleek."
1,"The amazon echo is great. It has amazing sound. I like the ability it can be operated from your phone, online, and by voice control."
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.
1,Great product... Met all my expectations
1,Opened the box and was able to quickly and easily hook up to my wifi. Great to play music through.
1,Great table for the price. You can download games and so much more. Its great for young kids.
1,It's a great product. I not only have books that I read on there but also can download games for my kids.
1,I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with
0,"After only 4 days, the device would not charge. It was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7% after being plugged in all night. This was our second Amazon Fire Tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. Decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly I've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet."
1,I was pleasantly surprised when I got this as a gift. Unlimited fun.
1,Great beginner tablet for my son! He plays his abc mouse app and watches the movies off of prime.
1,I love this speaker. It does everything you could ever imagine. Love the fact that I can order something from amazon by just talking to Alexa.
1,"Easy to set up, sound not bad for a Kitchen Location. Use it everyday!"
1,"My husband loves it, he even gets on facebook. And he loves playing games on it!"
1,This has been excellent purchase as avid reader it has been a pleasure bringing hours of entertaining joy. I love the lightweight sleek design & size. I take it everywhere. It is easy to use & capable of downloading everything I need.
0,I get frustrated with this alot. I like being able to speak commands but she never seems to know much even though we add skills to her. She is always saying she doesnt know that. The speaker is not the quality that I would expect for the price.
1,Since purchasing this product I rarely ever watch live tv anymore. It does exactly what I wanted it to.
1,"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
1,"Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight."
1,"The integration to my home automation is transparent, I hope devices offered a way/skill to connect to all systems so I could have running amazon-google-apple-microsoft at the same between them.Amazon per what I researched was the best at my time of purchase, and it really makes it simple. It delivers on what they promise."
1,I bought one for myself and it is my first kindle. Just love it and got a second as a birthday gift to one of my friends.
0,"I had a Nook, but it died so I wanted a replacement, and bought this Fire tablet on black friday last year because it was very inexpensive, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. It's OK for basic web surfing, but it's limited, slow, and has one little speaker on the back so if you lay it on a table you won't be able to hear it very well."
1,Bought for my mother for book reading. It's bigger than her phone and holds more. She really likes it.
1,Gift for my sister and she is loving it!! Would definitely consider getting one for myself.
1,"I like the convenience of my Kindle a lot for reading, and the process for buying books from Amazon is easy and flawless, as well as cheaper than buying physical books. There are a lot of $1.99 specials of very good books. I just wish the Kindle was slightly larger - more the size of a typical paperback book - because when I'm reading it feels like I'm ""turning"" a page every few seconds."
1,I purchased two Amazon Fire pads for my kids. It has everything they need and you can't beat the price!!!
1,I purchased the Kindle Fire as a replacement for my Nook Tablet. My hope was that it would be a reasonable replacement for what I essentially was primarily using as an E-reader. It has surpassed all of my expectations at a much more reasonable cost.
1,MY WIFE DEARLY LOVES COMMUNICATING WITH ALEXA> SHE IS CONSTANTLY ASKING ALEXA FOR INFORMATION ON TIME< WEATHER< MUSIC AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THE INTERNET HAS TO OFFER
1,Nice size and color. It was easy to grip. very pleased
1,I have owned this Amazon echo for almost two months now and I am enjoying it.
1,I bought it for my fiancé and he can't get enough of it. Awesome purchase.
1,i love to read book on that device. i would recommend this
1,I found this unit easy to setup. It also allowed me to view my Netflix account without wearing out my PlayStation .
1,"using echo for weather, music, and asking questions. Worry about ordering stuff online.Still learning all the things you can do with alexa."
1,This item ties in perfectly with my new Alarm system with camera's and thermostat control.
1,"Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,"
1,Speaker is much better than the smaller one but can be connected to other speakers as well. Easy to do literally everything via voice.
1,"This tablet is a great price and perfect for kids, however the picture quality could be better"
1,I really like my fire. So much to do and easy to use.
1,"Great tablet and its price for it, it's awesome my kids love it and it keeps them entertained."
1,This tablet is great. So glad I purchased this item.
1,Great little streamer. Little to no buffering for amazon prime. Easy to load Kodi for expanded fealtures.
1,This is simple tablet to use for any beginner or kids
0,Based on the price it is easy to see that this tablet is not something that will knock your socks off but is good for children that like to read books.
1,great and easy to use budget tablet for 35 when I purchased it. Get one
1,Easy setup and use. Couldn't ask for a better product.
1,my husband loves this gift I bought this for Christmas
1,"The Amazon echo is a fun item for entertainment, and provides lots of options for games, and general help, like a 'ask jeeves'."
1,"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
1,I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
1,"I love my Amazon Echo! The sound is phenomenal. She is very responsive and is so easy to use. We love ordering from Amazon with it, using it to teach our kid animal noises and even playing games!"
1,It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
1,I mostly use my echo paired with my Phillips hue system to control the lights. I also use it for setting alarms and timers and occasionally a flash news briefing
1,"I Love it! It is easy for anyone to use. Easy to transport, too."
1,Easy to use for books and audio. Will use on vacation.
1,Love it! This is my second Kindle. Would definitely recommend it.
1,I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
1,"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
1,"Did not need a large tablet,just something to use in my spare time.Has all the features I need,from books to games and can also axcess my emails.The price was very good(under $50)."
1,Enjoy my Amazon fire tv box work great lots better than the fire stick no more buffering
1,Just what I needed
1,I bought the Echo primarily for it's voice control of devices and secondarily to listen to music. As an ambient music player it is better than I had expected and am using it more for that than I had anticipated.Setup was easy. I expect to be connecting more devices and using more as time goes on.
1,Our kids use these and they are a great tablet for the price. Handy for reading ebooks. They don't have quite the wifi range as a laptop but otherwise work fine.
1,Alexa works great and I like that she learns as she goes I even got 3 dots to work just like her.
1,I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.
1,I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn't have with my old kindle.
1,Bought for my grandson who is four and he can operate it like a champ
1,"I purchased this as a gift, the kids can't get enough of it. They now enjoy reading more."
1,"I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it."
1,I love my fire stick it provided hours of entertainment
1,"Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden."
1,Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card!
1,"Great product if you need to read e-books, good battery life."
0,"We 2 Amazon Fire's for our kids for Christmas. We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times."
1,My daughter who is two loves it. She colors and dose puzzles
1,I never expected this small device could have so many features. Its good but you need to buy a memory extension
1,Easy to set up. Great definition and apparently comes with a prime subscription.
1,This box has a ton of apps and features on it as it comes... and it gets even better once you install KODI!
1,I decided on purchasing instead of the name brands
0,"It was a cheap tablet just for kids to watch movies. However, it forces you to put your credit card numbers to register the product. I don't want to since kids will be playing with it. I don't want them to be able to purchase apps without approval. Reset it to factory default, but the setup changed not the same as first started. Anyway, I won't but it again."
1,Easy to setup. Bought Amazon Echo for the living room and Amazon Dot for the bedroom. Fantastic AI.
1,"My parents had a Kindle Paperwhite they were sharing and loved it so much they wanted another one so they wouldn't have to take turns anymore. Unless you're looking for the full Android experience with the Fire or FireHD, this is the best Kindle model - the Voyager model doesn't add enough to justify it's higher cost. My tech-adverse mother absolutely adores her Paperwhite!"
1,"Great, I can watch anything I want with hd quality"
1,"This is wonderful, no more lugging books around and you always have something to read and you never have to worry about finding a book or it being backordered. Should have bought this years ago! Great for anybody that loves to read."
1,Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
1,Daughter bought for 2nd cheap tablet for movies. Great
1,Very happy with this product. I was all we expected it to be
1,I have cut the cord because of this item because of that I'm saving a ton of money
1,"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
1,Works good for a plug in for the kindle fire that I bought
1,So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
1,I have been wanting an Amazon echo for quit sometime. It is everything and more then what I hoped for. It's an incredible speaker on top of being the best source for all information. The kids even enjoy Alexa playing games and singing songs. It keeps my life more organized and more entertaining. Best money I have ever spent on my love of gadgets.
1,"We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals"
1,Does the job.
1,I would recommend this tablet for parens. My kids love this tablet.
1,loved the voice search easy to install and very easy to use
1,it's a great product to stream all your favorites.
1,I really like this product. I can access the internet with the Fire TV and watch my shows via Netflix. It is also user friendly.
1,Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school
1,Decided to go with the Fire TV because of wireless issues and couldn't be happier.
1,great device...a lot of learning to do. we hsve a lot more of exploring to do with Alexa
1,"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
1,This is my second Kindle as I updated from a previous model. This is lighter more comfortable to hold and the internal light is amazing.
1,Great Value On A Tablet. I bought this for travel. At $49 if you lose or drop it you are not out $100's of dollars. It performs great.
1,excellent product I would buy all mu grand kids one
1,Alexa echo is a great device. It's pretty easy to use and convenient.
1,Bought to use with Kindle. Works fine! Good quality and charges the kindle quickly.
1,"Truly enjoyed it, meets customer needs great for games, reading and day to day usage"
0,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
1,"I have my Alexa in the kitchen on counter, and it is fun to ask questions about weather, sing songs and about recipes. I bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my neighbor, we both LOVE it! It's fun to speak out loud and interact with Alexa. Thanks for making a great product Amazon!!"

1,"Got this for my daughter that is entering 6th grade. Not only is she reading more, but reading more complex books and expanding her vocabulary tremendously with the word ""look up"" feature. Screen is free of glare and looks much like a paper book as the name implies. Great for learning and recreational reading."
0,I was setting up 2 of the same tablet and this one wouldn't connect to the wifi. When I brought it back for an exchange there were none in store and they didn't even have them on their website! Ended up getting a refund and purchasing the same model from Amazon
1,Is Great product. Easy to set up. Worked instantly.
1,My first dedicated streaming box and it works great. Plenty of apps to watch my shows and the remote is simple to learn. Also having access to my Amazon purchased movie and prime shows/movies is a nice bonus.
1,"This does everything. So worth it. For the price and compared to more expensive, it holds it's own. Compact, fast, amazing....and check the price!"
1,"The Amazon Echo is great! My whole family is enjoying it. I got it for Father's day, and have used daily since then. Alexa is amazing! Her voice recognition is unbelievable, and it even compensates for my foreign accent. My only complaint is that the the Echo volume isn't high enough for me. That's why I gave it a 4-star rating."
1,Its a great reader. I use it at night instead of my phone and its much easier on the eyes. And the battery seems to last forever.
1,I left my old kindle on an airplane and had to purchase a new one. This one is much easier to use. The controls are more intuitive and loading books from my library in the cloud is so easy now!
1,I bought two of these for my daughters. Works great for the kids and if they drop them and break your not out a huge chunk of money like you would be for an IPad.
1,Echo is like having your own personal assistant. It's a blast to wake up every morning and finding out how traffic is and what the weather forecast looks like.
1,"I haven't hooked it up yet, but i have herd nothing but great things about it."

1,Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.
1,An interesting addition to the home. Easily recognizes speech from multiple sources and is able to answer most questions. It is a bit complicated to get all set up and to determine what is free and what requires subscriptions. Works very well.
1,Echo is wonderful and super smart. Love you can interrupt a skill and she will return to it when finished with what you asked her.
1,"My grandchildren each received a Kindle fire and have downloaded books, and games best Christmas gift ever."

1,Great addition to the family room. Easy to set up and use.

1,Very user friendly. Nice for travel. Keeps a charge for a long time.
1,I have both Amaxon-Echo and Google home . I don't find but little between the two .

1,"I bought it for my nephew and he loves it, he thinks me for every weekend he comes over with it !"
0,Bought this for my daughter. Tablet works amazing. Only thing I didnt like was that you are REQUIRED to place a CC on file with amazon in order to use it.I would say if you are looking for a tablet stick to the samsung galaxy models vs others.
1,"Love my Amazon Echo, very responsive, mainly use it for weather and music. Answers any questions I have. Soon I will connect it to some lights, for a start"
1,Small and easy to carry in my purse. I like that I can change the page on the sides without consistently dirtying the screen with fingerprints.
1,Echo is good for listening to music and quick information. Great for hands free timers and alarms.
1,"Good for the price, but that's not it! The interface is clean as ipad and but there is limitation in app stores. Initially I tried to use this Fire tablet to cast videos to my TV which has the Chromecast embedded. I have not figured out how I can do it. Beautiful display, easy transition from my paperwhite, connected easily to my wifi. I haven't done much yet except read books. It looks so pretty! TANGERINE is so pretty! Good Price as well!"
1,"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
1,I have wanted an inexpensive tablet for awhile and my wife surprised me with this Kindle for my birthday. It's perfect for my needs.
1,"When I checked it online it said it had 6 months of free subscription of the antivirus but there is nothing with my purchase, I did read it said they will email me the download information but nothing in that part very disappointed. I will only recommended to a friend if they have antivirus subscription at home."

0,We bought the tablet to give as a prize in a baby shower contest. We thought it was a good price and we decided to purchase.
1,"Being an avid reader with a preference towards hardbacks I was very skeptical of e-readers. Because I also travel extensively carrying hardbacks and having enough lighting to read has been a challange. My husband purchased a Kindle Paperwhite for me for Christmas. Upon opening I wasn't sure I was ready to go digital - HOWEVER I love it, I've already completed 2 books. The paperwhite is backlit and easy to hold. It fits in the palm of my hand so one handed reading is easy. I am now a believer ...."
0,So far so good. Display is not as bright or clear as my iPhone but then again I only paid 30 dollars for the tablet
1,Great for home use and makes a great housewarming gift!
1,"Great product to start home automation. A bit kludgy for some due to enunciation which frustrates some. For most people it is good and with patience it will learn, but you need to be patient."
1,"Everyone should have one because it has so many great features. Listen to music, control home security, find out what the weather is and all by just asking."
1,"Love this gal. We play games, listen to music, set mood lighting, etc. and she always listens to me! Best Buy had best price. Tired of being ignored? Buy one now!"
0,"I previously owned the previous model. There is very little difference between this and the older model. (Apart from the 4K, which only works with Netflix at this time). I still hate the ugly interface!, I wish Amazon would allow users to use their own skins"
1,My son loves this tablet because of all the apps on the store. we love it because of the parental controls allow us to control what he gets in the app store lol
1,Taking some time to figure it all out but I love it!!
1,"What a difference and got a super deal before Christmas. The new Kindle Fire not only does UHD with my monitor, the interface is really nice. I think it's much better than the Roku 3 I have been using and the Roku 4 that couldn't recognize my UHD HDMI port. It would only do 1080p. Plan to buy another to replace my Roku 3, for a 1080p TV. NICE!"
1,Much prefer reading books on my Kindle than on iPad
1,The item for my son is 4 years old he really likes it it's a good buy
1,Purchased 2 as high school graduation presents. They were a HUGE hit bringing them to college.

1,Much snappier than the fire stick highly recommend.
1,"Alexa can do everything from playing music, turning on lights to regulating your thermostat"
1,So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !
1,I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
1,I purchased 2 of these for my kids. They work very good. No quite as solid as original kindle fire.

1,I bought 5 last year and 2 more this year for gifts. They are simple to use and the youngest can even do it himself (5YO). Get the Kindle free time for the kids. You can set the amount of time they can play games and then they can only read books. Great for the whole family!
1,"The size, speed and battery are perfect for students to use on the go or just hangin in their rooms."
1,"Great item, fun for the whole family. Great way to save money"
1,Am very happy with my kindle fire. Many options. Books that I had read on my kindle transferred over without any issues.
1,"I got the Amazon Echo for my Parents. Since my Dad often ask us to look up things on our cell phones, I thought Alexa would be a great substitute in our absence. I love the easy setup and sound quality. My Dad is still learning how to navigate and at times gets frustrated with Alexa not having a response to his many questions. However keeping up with grocery list and Dr Appts are great for them. Amazon records what you ask which seems to pierce ones privacy. I'm sure it's for programming purposes since it's ever evolving, but beware what you ask Alexa because she'll remember."
1,"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!"
1,My only wish is I would be more computer litterate. I have trouble understanding what to do next to continue so I go back to start of games. I bought for the Kindle and reading apps. but have put netflix on it
1,"This device is great for any streaming needs, with a quad core mobile processor and 2 gb of ram this device has no problems handling any of your digital needs. Not to mention the AC wireless receiver and option to plug in usb devices and sd cards. I would highly recommend this device for anyone"
1,I liked it. Would be better if battery lasts longer. Great if you use Amazon or shop a lot there. I still love my iPad but Apple rips the wallet. I loved this tablet.
1,I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
1,"The echo is the first thing my husband and I listen to every morning, so easy to use."
1,What can I say my wife thought it was silly now when I come home from work almost every night she is listening to I hate country music.p.s. I love to control the lights with alexa.
0,I would recommend this to anyone it quite compact and easy to use and it good for any age.
1,"Didn't compare to the fire stick, unknown if better product, but love amazons creation"
1,This is all around a great tablet. My 1yr old can use it with ease. Also love how we can change the profiles to suit adults as well. Would recommend to anyone and all ages.
1,Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.

1,Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
1,Alexa makes it super easy to hear our favorite songs simply by asking! No need to sort through long play lists looking for what we want.
1,I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;
1,I have had the Firestick and recently upgraded to the Fire TV. Wow what an improvement over the Firestick. Well worth the slight up charge for the improved performance.

1,"I owned the last generation of Kindle and I can say that this is a very nice update. The screen is better, backlighting removes the need for a book light and the reading experience is very delightful! I would recommend this to anyone that wants the best eReader in the Market!"

1,I love the Amazin FireTV stick! I have one in every room of the house and don't have to worry about a cable bill ever again.
1,"Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone.

1,Nice little system for everyday uses. Haven't had any issue yet. Gonna try some things to see wut it can do

1,Amazon Alexa is amazing. Does more then I imagined. Easy to install and quick to learn how to use. Alexa is used each and everyday.
1,"It's 2017 and I was wondering to myself if I should jump on board and get a Kindle paper white. Now and days, people can read ebooks from smartphones to tablets. The thing with me is it caused me eye strain after trying to read my kindle books through my iPad. After much researching and reading the reviews on here, the paper white has been the best purchase decision I've made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain. This is only for reading ebooks and is very simple to use. Battery life is amazing and only charge once every two weeks. If you are just looking for a plain ereader, then this gem is your best bet."
1,"The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows"
1,Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.

1,"Being a busy mom, I am always looking for shortcuts. This one takes the cake! I use it for everything....checking the time, setting my morning alarm, adding items to my shopping list then being able to check them at the store from my phone....fabulous!!! Not to mention all the funny stuff she does!"
1,Purchased to have portable Alexa. Nice tablet for the money and recommend it.
1,Great for when I'm on the road and I can plug it in to use at any hotel I stay at. Easily understood and versatile to use.
0,These are perfect for kids to use and have some nice features for only 50 bucks. I recommend.
1,Cool asking it questions and getting accurate replies !
1,"Great product! The FireTV is very easy to use but requires the user to setup an Amazon account. This can be a free or prime account. The FireTV easily connects to your Wifi giving you access to Addons, games, music, movies etc. The voice controlled remote control makes searching for your favorite content easy but if you prefer, you can use the navigation features instead. Parental controls are provided if needed. There is also a video you can watch that shows a sample of the features this devise offers. Great purchase. I even took camping using my phone as a hot spot powered by a generator. The FireTV worked perfectly."
1,"I purchased this tablet thinking it will fill a void when my previous tablet was stolen, and it has done much more than i expected for it has apps no play store has, and amazon keeps me posted on any updated apps available for download through my email. I could not have purchased a better device for the price."
1,Bought for my mother to review pictures and play game. She is enjoying it since games can be played without Wi-Fi.
1,Love the voice control and functions. Need to download more apps. Want to purchase the lights to go with it. Never talks back to you.
1,"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two)."
1,Great for kids. Easy to use. Great price. Would recommend.
1,This is a great streaming box. It's is more than I expected.
1,"I like this product,. Alexa is a good listener and provides me the information instantly.IT is always a joy and funny when you ask a out of the world question and get a pretty accurate response."

1,This was very easy to set up and user friendly. A+
1,"Very pleased with the Fire TV. I thoroughly researched alternative products before deciding on the Fire TV. The unit is fast and I enjoy the integration with Amazon Video, Netflix and other streaming services. My only issue is that the box is very simplistic cosmetically as compared with Apple TV or G Box. Other than that this is a great product."
1,I like the size of this Kindle device. The battery lasts a very long time and charges quickly. Haven't found anything not to like about the Kindle Paperwhite.

1,Easy to use and can't complain about the price. Able to watch Netflix and surf the internet easily
1,For the cheaper price I really liked this tablet. We bought 2
1,"I purchased the paperwhite so that I could read in the middle of the night without disturbing my husband. It works like a charm, and helps me to fall back asleep faster. The different light settings are fantastic. I really love the dictionary look up feature too."
1,"I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around."
1,"I just want a small tablet to check news, weather etc from time to time, and this product works well for that purpose. It is not as fast on my iPad2 but it is a good choice considering the price."
1,"I wasn't sure how much I'd use the echo but I found that I use it for music, checking the weather and even cooking tips."
1,I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it! The picture quality & the non-glare is his favorite.
1,"It is awesome to be able to address ""Alexa"" and ask her to do things like play a song or turn on the lights while my hands are wet or I am busy."
1,I started our with just the Fire Stick at home. Once I purchased a 4k TV I decided to splurge on the Fire TV. I'm so glad I did the one thing that annoyed me about the stick was relying on WiFi stability and now I've ran an ether net straight to my router so problem solved.
1,"Light weight, easy to use and stays charged much longer than my previous one. Paper white is easier to read in low light too."
1,I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.
1,"Wonderful tablet to use while traveling or at home. Great for books, movies, and music. For the price, it can't be beat!"
1,Excellent value great apps and movies. the price was perfect.
1,What else can I say? This is an awesome little device and is leading me towards cutting out cable altogether.
1,"I love my Amazon box!! It's easy to use and with the right internet connection, there's no buffing or waiting for movies to download. I compared it to the Apple TV & for the overall money, this was the better purchase."
1,"My wife uses for watching movies, reading, Pandora etc...honestly does everything her more expensive tablets did."
1,The echo is amazing! I highly recommend this product!!!
1,I bought this for my two-year-old son to play games on so I wouldn't panic if he dropped it. It is also a great tool for you fire apps and Amazon Apps.
1,"Amazon Fire way surpassed my expectations. I have an IPad but wanted something smaller to read my emails and view videos while I was at work.I'm also able to view excel spreadsheet, without having to purchase another program. Battery has decent power too."
0,Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.
1,I am really enjoying my Amazon Echo!! It was very easy to set up and very easy to use (you just have to remember to say Alexa first). Showed it to my sister-in-law while she was visiting and now she wants to order one.
1,I purchased this tablet for a need family for christmas.I know they really enjoyed it
1,"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
0,"Good performance for most apps. However, I primarily purchased it to watch PS Vue, and although the PS Vue app is better than on Roku, it suffers from more lag and glitches than watching PS Vue via PS4 or PS3."
0,"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
1,"Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features."
1,"I got this tablet for my mom as an additional after X-mas gift. She likes the clean/simple/no fuss/etc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboard/mouse/etc., just your fingers for input."
1,I have no use for cable because I have everything I could ever need in the fire tv.
0,This item is a waste of money as none of the content is 4K. Buy the much cheaper Fire TV Stick instead.
1,Simple tablet for beginners. Has everything you neef.
1,I'm so happy with my Kindle! It's so easy to order books and it works great to read at the gym.
1,I've come from using a Roku and also a Nexus Player and this Amazon Fire TV blows the doors off of them. I do like the newer Roku 4 but you can't beat the price and features that this one has. I definitely recommend this one.
1,I love my Amazon Fire TV box. It is so quick and I have access to so many Apps and programs. I recommend it to everyone.
0,"Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality"
1,Great stuff for reading. I have been taking it everywhere with me. Reading is never more simple!
1,Very good value for money. You will not be disappointed if you choose the Fire tv.
1,"Since the Fire TV stick was announced, I've heard a lot of people wonder if it was something worth picking up, essentially asking what does this thing do that my TV doesn't do already The answer is going to be different for different people, but here's an easy way to think about it Amazon Fire TV Stick is an excellent purchase if:-Your TV is not a smart TV. Meaning your TV or dvd player did not come pre-loaded with apps such as Netflix, Youtube, Pandora etc...-Your TV is a smart TV, but apps do not perform well. Some smart TVs have painful performance when streaming video, apps can be difficult to update, wifi connection can be spotty etc...-You want to access Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, and other such apps on your TV-You are an Amazon Prime Member and want to access your Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Photo accounts-You want to participate in casual gaming on your television.-You want to listen to music on your TV-You want to have portability. In other words, Television access to the above services while you are travelling. (Amazon says the capability to use in hotels/dorms etc... with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is coming soon)So, the bottom line is that the Fire TV Stick allows you to access your movies, music and photos as well as games and more via your television. If your TV already does these things well, or you're already doing them via other devices such as a game console, then this may not be worth your while.So, how easy is it to use I'm telling you, you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minutes.Read more"
1,This was a present for my mother in law who is 70 for Mother's Day and she loves it and I was worried she might not. Now I'm going to probably get one for myself!!
1,It is very good. I like it. I will buy more items on bestbuy.com.
1,Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.
1,I bought this as a gift for a girl in the second grade. She maneuvers around on it really good.
1,My daughter loves this and uses it for her every day reminders and questions
1,I received the echo from my husband for Mother's Day. It is very helpful to me. Nice to know the weather before I get dressed in the morning.
1,It's fun having Alexa. It's hard to utilize it for all that it can do but if you take the time to learn it's a really helpful household tool.
1,Purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day. Wasn't sure what we would do with it but we're finding things. She takes it everywhere with her. Sometimes we put it where we're sleeping and have it play thunderstorm sounds while we're going to sleep.
1,This this my 4th one purchased! My granddaughter is in kindergarten and its a good learning tool!
1,"Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips"
1,It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
1,I love playing classic rock and that plays it great.
1,I can read it no matter how sunny it is outside. I have a kindle fire for inside and paperwhite for outside.
1,"I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself."
1,"Totally love this product, definitely makes time pass by faster and can take it anywhere"
1,Only reason I was not able to rate this five of five is that the app 3m cloud library is not yet compatible so getting books from the library requires an older app which does not work as well.
1,I purchased this for my father. He likes to watch movies and this was the best way for me to send him movies because he Ives out of town. Great product!!!
1,I have 2 of these one for each one of my kids I love it for kids the instead of buying something so expensive I chose this and the geek squad protection is awesome my son cracked the screen and they where just amazing and replaced it with a brand new one
1,This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend
1,"Using Alexa for mostly music but also for weather, tides and research. Love not having to make up my own playlist. I can just ask her to play a musician I think of any given day. Very spontaneous!"
1,"With the Amazon player, you don't need satellite TV. Saves you lots of money from cable or satellite companies."
1,Prefect for all reading conditions and environments. I take it everywhere.
1,This was a great buy. I read all the time and just got tired of carrying multiple hooks with me on flights. So this played a big role in packing
1,Very good tablet and it works very well. Easy to use.
1,"It was a breeze to set up, a life changer in some aspects from being control lights, temperature, music via voice commands.."
1,Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy
1,I bought it for my Dad to play games and to download books on it so he won't drain his phone battery.
1,It's very fast and it's very well made I really like the style of the box it's not bulky like the other boxes out there
1,"This is my second Amazon Fire TV, I got the second one with voice remote, but I don't seem to use the voice remote option that often, but I do like the Fire TV and use it frequently."
1,Great gift however I wish it was 16G. It was way the angel tree child wanted so thats what she got. Works great and screen is clear.
1,Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time
1,I use to control my smart devices in the home and listen to music. my kids also use to help them with their home work.
0,This product is a great product as long as the plug-in charge port doesn't break and quit taking a charge.
1,I bought tablets for my grandson's and they are perfect! I pre-loaded it with games and videos for kids their age (3 and 4) before giving it to them for Christmas. Well worth the money.
1,"I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet."
1,I love it and my two year old loves it to I love that it has parental locks on it
0,This is a good starter. As the company provides more devices that it can control it will become excellent. It's very limited at this time.
0,This item is useless to play music through voice recognition unless you pay for an amazon prime or Amazon music account. Once that is disconnected she only plays your music through manual control from a blue tooth connection from your phone. Pointless!!! More than half the questions I ask her she doesn't know the answers to. The only thing she's good for so far is the time and weather. That basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock I have ever purchased. I want my money back
1,Gave one to my mother. Easy to use and lots of applications.
1,"Nice display, convenient size, lots of apps and books."
1,"Siri at home - it is great when hooked up to lighting, music, etc."
1,My daughter was very happy she got for her birthday right away put it to work
1,Easy to use and get started with. Have had no issues at all and would recommend.
1,Bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she has a blast on it. Be sure to get the kid proof case too. Got to protect your investment.
1,seriously.... it's great and you should have one!!
1,"Works great, I love it, best streaming box I've ever had."
0,"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
1,I bought this for a young kid so that she would be able to have her own device to play games on. She's been extremely happy and we haven't encountered any issues or problems with her being able to use it.
1,This is my third Amazon Kindle and by far it is the best one. The adaptive lighting really helps as it is easy on the eyes. The battery lasts for weeks on a normal charge and charges to full pretty fast.I still enjoy the eink displays over a regular phone or tablet for extended reading periods.The kindle voyage is light weight and I was able to easily find cases and accessories online.I highly recommend the kindle voyage over the other kindle readers because of the advanced features.
1,Replaced original paper white with this new model and the recipient just loves it!!
1,"Nice for my hubby, he can watch Netflix and use it for the shows he watches."
0,"If you don't mind the slow performance, it is a good tablet for the price."
1,This is a lot of fun. Also very convenient since it is hands free.
1,"The fire box is very well made works great with amazon prime video and kodi. the only complaint i have is the remote doesn't have a on or off button,you have to buy a separate attachment for that."
1,Nice sounding speaker and by adding my Apps I can listen to my music
1,"This wasn't for me, but for a family member (I have a Kindle Fire HDX for self). They very much appreciate having this as a replacement for another tablet, seems to work better (less/no crashes, better battery) compared to the older one (not an amazon tablet). Side-loaded texture/next-issue as a way to get unlimited magazines (can access subscription on several devices) on this, and it works fine (usually, but once had to clear app data).This tablet is not as high-res as the HDX (so tiny text isn't as clear as it could be without zooming) but it's more than sharp enough for daily use, especially at this price range"
1,Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
1,Highly Satisfied with the product. Great price and performance
1,Works great as an ereader. Can hold so many books!
1,"Now that we have begun to figure out how to use this, we are liking it much better. It didn't want to work well for us. When I called Amazon's help line, the person told me I couldn't get Amazon music if I was only Prime member. I had to get the premium package. I called again and got a more knowledgeable person and got it straightened out. At times Alexa has trouble getting things right. Learning curve."
1,I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
1,This is awesome addition to the stationary Echo. I can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside. Great sound and long battery
1,It is not an out of the world product but for the price point it is what it is said to be . It does what it advertises nothing more or lessA little slower compared to Samsung Tabs or Ipads but again less then$35 on blackfriday cant complain
1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO WHEN HE VISITS COUSINS WHO HAVE TABLETS. ITS NOT A TABLET BUT HE HAS NO COMPLAINTS
1,I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. great
1,Bought the fire tv box because the stick was a bit slow and hardly had any space. The box works great and i don't have any streaming issues.
1,We picked these up to help people register to vote at events. They have proven to be durable with a respectable battery life and enough compute power to do the work without lag and annoyance. The size is perfect for voter registration drives or other community out reach.
1,"I purchase my Alexia about a month ago and waited to write this review in order to get more familiar with its operation. Set up was a breeze with no problems connecting to my home network. At present I am using my Alexia for my morning news briefs while having breakfast. Listening to Bloomberg, CNN, Fox, and Reuters news briefs you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world. If you wake her up by saying Alexia, good morning she will give you some interesting information concerning the day. I also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out. No longer do I have to search in my iPad. Listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and I can change the volume or skip song without even moving. She response to my voice from across the room. The timer function is a help when cooking, and setting a alarm by voice is a great convenience, eliminating some use of my phone. It would be nice to have Alexia call your contacts on your phone with IFTTT but that would involve uploading your contact list to Amazon, something that at the moment I would not do. My future plan is to interface Alexia with a smart home system which will operate by voice control. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend Alexia to anyone."
1,We already have an echo dot and pleased with it.Bought this on sale at Best Buy because we want a little better speaker which this model offers. Very pleased with sound and easy of adding it to my system
1,Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it
1,It is very kid friendly. It was very easy to use at home.
1,"Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn't sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get's her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture."
1,"Generally Alexa is spot on when asked a question. Whether it's the weather, the time, my upcoming calendar events or most music. However, when asked to play classic oldies, I will usually get old country music. When asked about an actor in a tv series, she doesn't know the answer, even though I can find the answer on google. My grand kids love it for the corny jokes they get."
1,What a buy. You can now get rid of cable and by this wonderful media streamer by Amazon. Very powerful and responsive.
1,"I enjoy this tablet, I find myself using it more than my laptop"
1,Tv look good in my room so I kind see videos thats good for me! !
1,This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.
1,"At first when my husband bought this, I fought more electronics to learn. I now love using it especially when I am cooking and I can saw Echo, add cinnamon to grocery list. I also have many cam lighting that I can only say turn on couch one or two or fireplace light and not light up all 9 cams. The say play music is great. It also tells jokes and the recent news or weather. we now have echoes on two levels of the house.But don't worry, he will add some to level 3 soon lol"
1,"I use this device for watching movies and TV shows. I will suggest install MX PLAYER for MP4,MKV,ETC videos. It is a nice device for beginners."
0,"Unfortunately, the first time I plugged the Tablet in to charge it up, the battery overheated and shorted out the tablet. I returned it to Best Buy for a full refund with no hassles."
0,The usablity wise good but install the Google store is messy
1,My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.
1,Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
1,This thing is awesome!!! Its very easy to setup and fun to use. The speaker sounds amazing and the microphone is incredible. I wish my siri could understand me as clearly and accurately as Alexa does. I can't wait to expand my whole house automation!
1,I Bought alexa for my children and find myself using it more.
1,It's worth it for the shopping and todo lists alone. Great product.
1,My kids are loving their kindles and they are easy for them and for me to manage
1,"Still getting to know how to use, but so far I am loving it"
1,Enjoy the small device as well the many features it offers. Will have to get use to the remote but otherwise okay. Price arrange also okay by it being an Apple's product.
1,"The unit works well. The camera is not super High Resolution, but it is great to have front and rear cams. Access to lots of apps and email. It's nice to have the extra tablet around the house, and for $35?Child, please. Even at $50, it is a solid value."
1,Works well and great for travel. Small and portable
1,Love this tablet. Great for social games and videos. Cant beat the price
1,Best kindle ever! Easy to use and so beautiful kindle. I really recommend this kindle.
1,Purchased this device for a three year old. He loves it.
1,"Haven't had a chance to use for books yet, but have used dictionary.Display is great."
1,"love the fire 7, perfect size, very light, i have it with me all the time."
1,Great build qualityGood screen resolution for the moneyCan install android applications -including kodi
1,"No complaints so far. Great price, great tablet. Purchased an SD card so no worries there. I like it so much I'm going to buy one for my niece. She loves her games and books!!!"
1,"This is the best electronic purchase I've had in a year, and I buy a lot of shhhtuff."
1,Loved the item..great for my autistic stepson.he was very happy.
1,"Device is easy to install and user friendly. Best media streaming in my opinion, a must buy."
1,"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly."
1,I bought this tablet for my grandson who loves it. He can download books to read and play games as well. He carries it with him wherever he goes. Has really enjoyed having his own tablet.
1,"I have an iPad mini but it's impossible to see in the sun. I started thinking about getting a kindle while on vacation and trying to read a book at the pool. Damp hands,wrinkled pages - sunscreen all made the experience icky. I live the size, battery power, ease of use and you can see it outside."
1,Great product! I will recommend this to all of my family and friends.
1,"The amazon echo is a great product. We got it when it was on sale and liked how new features are constantly added. We use it often for weather, news, turning on our lights, setting multiple cooking timers and more. It quickly became something we use daily."
1,"Great performing little device, easy installation and great picture quality."
1,Good product. Love how light and sleek it is. Will recommend.
1,Works well for the intended purpose. Easy to download the app I required for additional viewing.
1,Best has some of the best products! They are very helpful in finding products! This tablet works great for reading books or watching movies!
1,"This is my first e-reader, and I generally like it. I've been using it for a couple of months on weekends, and haven't yet needed to charge it since the first time after buying it.The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read. I'm very accustomed to using 8+ inch tablets, so a 6"" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books."
1,Best electronic reader. The base kindle is hard to read because the lack of light and the other readers and apps just don't offer the quality experience and feel of the kindle paperwhite.
1,works as expected no issues and I am good with prodcut
1,I was buying tablets for two grandkids ages 5 and 10. These did the trick and I didn't have to spend a fortune. I also bought the protective cases to protect them...Great purchase!
1,Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse
1,"Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up."
1,Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own .
1,"Bought this for my grandkids - they love talking to it, asking questions, and playing music. It keeps them occupied all the time!"
1,This was bought as a replacement for my wife's previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera.
1,It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons
1,So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good
1,if you don't already have a smart tv -this is the way to go - Amazon has so many more choices than Netflix plus Prime gets you free shipping on top of free movies
1,Amazon Echo is the best thing you do not know you need. It is nice to have Prime along with it. The speaker fills the house with nice sets on request. Go get one. And you will soon find you want one in other rooms. Dots do nice here.
1,"I have had a Kindle since the very first generation, and they have come along way since then. This version is pretty handy, reads well, and navigates okay for kindle . It there was any drawback I would say that the store shopping experience thru the actual kindle needs improvement . It's still very antiquated, and seems antiquated compared to today's browsing market."
1,This product is a godsend! Helps me stay organized with my to-do list! Keeps me out of the rain by providing weather alerts! It's allowing me to work on my dance moves by playing all the tunes! LOVE IT!
1,Thank You
1,We bought this for our kids when we were traveling to the Caribbean on vacation. This was the perfect lifesaver as we were able to load up with lots of apps to keep them occupied.
1,"Love this thing, it's super fast and very little to no buffering when streaming my movies."
1,Love this thing! It is super easy to use and set up!

1,This latest version of the kindle reader is great. Paper white is esp nice.
1,This is an easy wHen to cut your cable bill and easy to set up. Programming is as easy as using your smartphone.
1,Absolutely love the Amazon Echo!! Had one for our FL home & had to buy another for our NY home. Love the GREAT sound & the ease of playing music or listening to talk shows.
1,having a 4 and 6 years old kids helps a lot.. it provides music for the kids while they are playing and my kids can ask alexa everything especially asking vocabs...
1,By far the best streaming device in the market. I have one for every room in my house.
1,"It's ok, I didn't know that I would have to pay for movies"
1,"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
1,"This is an awesome tablet, not to mention and excellent price!!!"
1,"Family and I are loving it and we have yet, had a real opportunity to get into it!"
1,Firestick provides opportunity for families to spend more quality time together with many features and endless supply of movies
0,My adaptor doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but there are no instructions. It looks pretty simple. So it just simply doesn't work.
1,Everything you need with this little box. Get yours today!
1,I purchased one of these for each of my kids. The design is very easy to understand and very user friendly. I would definitely recommend for someone that doesn't need the full functionality of an iPad.
1,Pretty easy to figure out. Lots of different options. So many cool apps!
1,This is a great value works great as a table has a good camera and serves as a good MP3 player. Love that the storage can be expanded.
1,"Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one."
1,This a great table for my granddaughter. She loves it!
1,this is a great buy i first bought the fire stick did not like due to fact it was slower less memory and kept on overheating. the fire tv is way faster more memory and never over heats
1,Very nice kindle fire...great Christmas gift...liked alot
1,"I love my Amazon fire tv!! Use it with Playstation Vue, perfect device to cut the cord!!"
1,"When Best Buy put it on their Deal of the Day, I jumped on it. It does so much and is very easy to set up and use. I've had it for 2 months and I'm still exploring all of the things it does. It just keeps getting better and better every week... Just go to your Alexa app, on your phone or tablet and see what's new this week."
0,"This is way to complicated for kids, my kid was frustrated trying to figure it out"
1,This box provides a wonderful image on my 4K Samsung TV. The program content is extraordinary. You can install whatever apps your heart desires and see virtually the world.
1,"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
0,a lot of the times Alexa will come back and say I don't understand the question get very annoying
1,"This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!"
1,"The Echo works great and the sound is excellent. In addition to our household, we gave it as a gift to our kids families and everyone loves it."

0,"I love it for reading but, it has issues when searching the Internet at times."
1,Easy to use. A useful source for kids activity while on the road load up movies books and games! Cheap product but great use good education for ur kids too
1,"Easy to Use, Backlight feature is really nice. Like that you can adjust the font sizes and type."
1,"I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age."
1,I bought this for my 4 year old she loves it never outs if down
1,This is the second Kindle Paperwhite we have purchased for one of our Grand Children. This is a great tool to promote reading for kids or adults. This tool combined with Amazon's available online subscriptions or purchasing books individually is the way to go.
1,"I bought this for my daughter who is in college. She likes it and carries it many places, even hiking. She says it works very well for her."
1,"This was a replacement unit for a first generation unit. It works perfectly, the old unit would not hold a charge."
1,Happy with device. It works as advertise. Can not stop using it.
1,This is probably the best bank for your buck. Skip a fancy dinner and get the Amazon fire you wont go wrong.
1,Works great and was easy to set up. Will get rid of cable with this device.
1,Love the Kindle! Will allow me to travel with my favorite books all in one place
1,"I use for weather, traffic, ordering on Amazon, music, Audible books on tape. Now audible for dogs!"

1,I love it. Good Camera and perfect for surfing the web.
1,This is one of the greatest things I've ever bought
1,Good tablet for basic used. Just need it for basic functions. Perfect
1,This was a gift but I also own an Echo of my own that I have had for over a year. I use it daily and would not be with out it. They are always adding more thing that it can do and it has almost become a member of the family.
1,Setup was extremely easy. Easy for grandchild to use. Only difficulty is with parental controls stopping connection with library.
1,I bought this for my parents to be more connected into Facebook messenger (they don't have phones) and video calling. It's been easy for them to use and learn -- though I highly recommend a keyboard case. I bring it out to read news sites in their new tablet formats. Small but useful. An amazing product given the price.
1,Love it love it love it love it love it love it love it
1,Still exploring all the things we can do with it. I enjoy listening to radio on it.
1,it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
1,Great product. Easy to use and operate. Would recommend
1,"The Paperwhite was what I expected. It's easy to set up an account, and I can use it outdoors in the sun. Sadly, downloading library books is not as user friendly as I had hoped, but Amazon is in the business of selling books, not lending them."
1,what an amazing device. super fast in comparison to the fire tv stick. best streaming device available in my opinion!
1,Cool tab. Must buy for kids. Amazon need load apps
1,"I mostly use the Echo for home automation tasks, like controlling my thermostat and my Harmony remote control. Still new to it - learning how I can use it to assist with shopping and to-do lists. Love the fact I can change my default music service to Spotify and have it stream music wherever I want. If you're into automation, get the Echo!"
1,My son's love there tablet. Great but for the price
1,Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
1,Picked this item up while on sale to control all my NEST & phillips hue lights. Has a much better voice recognition than SIRI
1,I purchased this for Christmas.it was easy to set up and am now looking to purchase more for the other rooms.
1,I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.
1,A must for someone who loves to read. Great to carry arounnd!
1,Information and music and all you have to do is ask! Alexa is amazing!
1,"We debated on getting this because we already have an xbox one for streaming. However, this device streams seamlessly. The remote makes finding shows simple."
1,"Still learning the things Alexa can do, but so far, I'm extremely happy with my purchase."
1,I bought this tablet for my husband and son and both have not had any issues with it. Easy to use. Great over all.
1,Great gift for my nieceShe is using it every day
1,"I purchase 2 on Super Bowl Sunday for my 5 & 7 year old birthday. It was the perfect gift, because the 2 love their gift. The tablets was for a girl and a boy, so I purchase a pink & a blue. The tablet is very child proof."
1,Absolutely love my Kindle.. it is small enough to fit in a pocketbook or small bad. Love taking it with me to the pool or beach. the paper white make reading so much easier .. Highly recommend
1,Still getting more and more abilities loaded onto system.
1,so if purchasing three more of these after the initial one doesn't say GET ONE I don't know what else to say. rated a 4 not 5 because of sketchy voice recognition sometimes.
1,"Brought my old tablet in to my local store, and when they said that I would need to replace iit, they suggested this tablet. I love this tablet as much as my firsdt one! Easy to set up and use, plus the price was reasonable. :)"
1,One of the best purchases I have bought. I love this speaker and all the things it can do
1,"Perfect size, great in all lighting situations. Easy to hold, handle and transport. Makes reading even better!"
1,This is so much better than the fire stick. No lag and an Ethernet port.
1,"Amazon is obviously banking on this item and the Amazon Sticks. In all fairness it is a great product with a lot to offer and a good price point. I like the Voice control feature to easily navigate through your favorite shows, movies and all. I also have a smart home and like the flexibility to control every inch of it from my TV remote too (control lights, doors, Electronics, you name it). You can also do a little programming and installed Kodi to have free movies and such, Yes I said FREE, anyways it is a great product."
1,Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.
1,Best investment made. I use this daily for reading and doing light work.
1,Great little tablet would have got Five stars if you could use it with chromcast
1,Great!! Use it everyday. Easy to use and find movies
1,"best little item that's been out, compact and fun to use.."
1,"I use this daily for playstation Vue, constant 60fps and it looks great."
1,Good tablet for the price. Easy to use. User friendly
1,Item returned. Already had this item
1,I've had the stick but upgraded to the box for faster speed
1,I have cancelled Direct TV and I am using this plaform for personal entertainment.......love it and love the fact that I don't have one those big DirectTV DVR monstrosties sitting in front of my TV anymore which I was paying a monthly fee for. Love Amazon Prime platform there is so much free content available if your a Prime member. I choose this over apple TV because apple charges for everything and can get expensive like Direct TV.
1,There is no difference in reading from a book and a Kindle.
1,For the price this is a great little tablet. Its fairly fast and fits my needs.
1,The kindle is the best ebook reader. I love it and use it daily.
1,I like this Kindle its small size is what I was looking for and I enjoy playing games on it!
1,Way better than the amazon stick. I use it for kodi
1,My home has a lot of wifi product for example light switch and lifx bulbs and nest thermostat. Amazon echo was the last the to make it work all together. Alexa makes it easier and fun to connect your home
1,"Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value."
1,"When connected to SmartThings, Alexa works great. Alexa will hear you from rooms away. The only changes I would make are:1) Make it portable2) Better speaker quality3) Alexa app needs improvement"
1,I find more ways to use Echo each and every day. From home automation to streaming music.
1,"This is such a great product, to listen to music, get the latest news, look up information on the web and get jokes of the day!"
1,It is easy to operate and happy with Amazon Fire. I wasn't sure how it was going to work but very satisfied of my purchased.
1,got it for my three year old and it's perfect for him
0,"News, weather and music. That is pretty much all we use it for. If you have Amazon Prime it's nice to just request certain music to play. Sound is ok, not terrible, not great."
1,It's so much better than her viewing on her tiny phone. Great price too.
1,Great to read with during the day and night. Easy to carry.
1,"This is my second Echo. If you are NOT into home automation, the speaker is worth the price just as a speaker. However, if you have an amazon Prime membership, the Echo really shines with access to prime music and other Amazon services. It is also a good way to start into home automation. I personally have the wink Hub and Relays; Alexa (Echos Siri) integrates perfectly with Wink and IFTTT. I am placing Echos in rooms where I want Wireless music and the dots in the rest of the rooms to control my Smart devices from anywhere in the house."
1,We really enjoy it. Bought it to watch our slingbox but we have found tons of extra content that we really enjoy
1,"I bought this has a gift for my kids. They love their Amazon Fires. A few down sides with the internal memory and speakers. Pretty weak in these areas. The memory and speakers definitely could use some upgrading. Fortunately the device has a slot for memory cards and we can connect to a Bluetooth speaker. To get the maximum use of the device you need Amazon Prime. Compared to Netflix, Prime is very competitive."
1,I recommanded this product to specially highschool student.It is good touch screen and good functionality.
1,"Gave as gift works good so far, others have one and have enjoyed"
1,Alexa has become an integral family member. Love her!
1,Tablet is easy to use and I can carry it with me in a medium size purse. Easy to down load books and other information. I had the Kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure!
1,"I got this for my kids and I am able to have parental control over all of them, put a time limit on play time, they each have their own apps, games and books that are appropriate for their age. My kids love it and they are learning! With this kids edition I get 1 free year of all kids appropriate app,games,videos and books!"
1,I would be happy to give it as Christmas gifts to many of the people I know. I love the size of the screen. A charge last and the Bluetooth sinks well with the wireless keyboard. It's almost as good as I IPad.
1,Excellent improvement over my first kindle which was the original. Love the backlight for reading at night.
1,Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.
1,This is my 3rd Echo. One on each floor of our house. Works great and has so many features. Everyone here loves it.
1,I'm happy with the purchase. Had to buy additional memory but satisfied.
1,So what they have adds. My wife got it for $50 and I know on Black Friday it was $35. Where else are you going to find a color screen for that price. It works well and couldn't be happier.
1,"I've had my tablets since last year and they still in great condition, ii read on it a lot so I think I made a good choice"
1,Great item easy to use and setup fast and great for surfing the web yes I would recommend
1,Easy to use and can put parental blocks on it so that the kids don't get into what they shouldn't.
1,This device is for me the best streaming device out there.
1,Just what my 10 year old needed to take her tech to the next level. Love the parental controls to keep her safe online
1,Everyone should have one. Awesome!! Just ask Alexa any question and she will give you the answer.
1,Very compact and functional. I especially like the screen color choices in the Kindle Reader.
1,"Cool new product, and it makes everything so much easier to just say what I want and have Alexa find it for me."
1,"I now have 3 of these tablets. I use them for my harmony remotes, baby camera monitors, youtube for the kids, receiver software, reading articles and books, games and many other things. Its not the best tablet out there, but for under $50 its great. My one issue is that it does NOT have the play store, so if amazon does not have an app you will have to side load it. Other than that you can't beat it."
1,I like the 2 way camera. Took a while to get used to it. I had a very old Kindle so this is way better.
1,"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device."
1,My wife loves this Kindle. The only complaint is the charging port has been a problem. We ended up exchanging it for a new one after a week or so because the port was loose and it was very hard to charge it. The second one has been much better but there has been a couple of times the charging port has given us issues.
1,It's the Amazon Echo. Does what it says and gets you in touch with Alexa hands-free.Works good and awesome for the smart home person.
1,Love Echo for streaming music and trivia and weather reports. Very entertaining
1,This is a nice small tablet. Works well and great with Amazon products. A great price.
0,"Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps"
1,"Bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. Great investment"
1,"It took me a while to break down and finally buy a digital book, I'm a big fan of paper books. I love the Kindle so far! I wanted an eReader that I could only read books on, no apps or games, that's what my phone is for, and so far I am very happy :)"
1,I like the Amazon Tap because it is portable. I have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier.
1,You could pay more and get something better but for reading comics and watching YouTube this is fine
1,I bought this for my seven year old. Last year was an iPad and lasted 3 months. I couldn't see spending $300 on another so I settled for this kindle. She loves it and I'd recommend it as a great tablet for the younger kids and at a great price.
1,Brought it as a Christmas gift and then I fell in love with it after setting it up. small and simple.
1,You can't beat it for the money. Really cool tablet !
1,"I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it���s not cable. I miss cable, but I don���t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer."
1,"It takes some time to understand all the possibilities with the Echo, but it does really cool stuff. I'd add the sound quality is much better than I had expected as well."
1,This really helped me use my echo more- having 2 plugs helps make moving it to another room easier.
1,"I bought the Kindle Paper White for travel, its so much lighter than bulky books and can fit in your hand luggage/pocket to read while travelling. So easy to use no screen glare like tablets have so you can read it anywhere. Has adjustable screen brightness and font size too.Has the technology to allow you to order and download books from anywhere you happen to be. I love it so much I bought my sister one too!"
1,I purchased 2 regular amazon fire sticks around $50 each they would turn off in the middle of shows/movies and weren't working properly I had several issues with them so I decided to give this model a go and it's been worth it so far no issues.. worth the extra $$ it's reliable.
1,Easy to set up and use. My entire family loves to ask Alexa questions. Speaker is great.
0,"I dont own this, first off. But 1 amp wont charge anything very quickly, and I only write this review because they advertised it on my Fire. The price is 19.99 as of this advert, and thats way out of line for a 1 amp charger."
1,"The Kindle is easy to use, has a bright back light and travels conveniently in a coat pocket."
1,Bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!
1,Great device fast and big enough to see and easy to use !!!!
1,Great way to start kids onto using a device with technology
1,Very good item. Works well for child. easy to use.
1,This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
1,I think k this is an awesome product it was very affordable and so far does absolutely everything that I need it to do and it is very user friendly easy to use I'm still getting to know this product but I have no complaints so far
1,This is a great tablet for the money. Able to do everything a higher priced tablet does
1,"I bought this as a surprise for my fiance, he loves it! It has quickly become a standard part of our daily routines."
1,We love Alexa she is fun and informative. I would get this as a gift for a friend.
1,This is a fantastic tablet and only cost $35. Can't beat it. It has ads but they're not obnoxious. Would definitely recommend it.
1,"the new kindle fires are amazingly good, the only thing that I have to say is the battery life is bad in it. other than that it is well worth it."
0,i did not need this
1,I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends.
1,"Easy hook up. I keep it in the family area, the grandkids ask Alexa questions and play songs. Fun for everyone."
1,"We use our Echo to control our interior lighting, as well as to set a timer , playing music, getting the weather, and general information. Oh, and the shopping list is a great feature!"
1,Alexa integrated work faster then the fire stick I would recommend this device watch my 4K videos
1,"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader."
1,"I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum."
1,It is a good cheap tablet. Lacks in performance but acceptable for price
1,"I got this as a Christmas gift for a family member. You really can't beat the price of this tablet, especially compared to other tablets in its price range. It blows the Digiland tablets out of the water. It is pretty simple to use, only thing that I don't like is the Amazon app store's selection of apps."
1,"Very good item, very happy with it, will buy again"
1,We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
1,Was not hard to set up and love the quality. Good screen size and clarity.
1,"I purchased this as a gift (Christmas) for my girlfriend but i gave it to her extra early, it's a very good tablet, got it on black Friday for the price $39.99 she love it. Thanks Best Buy."
1,I will use this until it blows up. So nice to touch one button and get anything you want
1,"Great product, great replacement for Smart TV. Will recommend."
1,"I love this Kindle. It is a replacement for one which was almost 5 years old when the built-in light stopped working. I used it constantly, for hours every day, carried it in my purse all the time, and traveled with it. I will not be without a Kindle. Replacing it was a foregone conclusion but I still read the reviews, just in case. :)"
1,"I am very pleased with this tablet. It is easily portable, user-friendly and has good battery life"
1,Good tablet for the price. Works as well as a more expensive model.
1,"had a regular kindle and this one is just as light but with a backlight so it helps with night time or train reading (when in tunnels).A lot faster too, as it's newer."
1,"Haven't had that much experience with it yet but from what I've done so far, it's been great fun. Love that it can be linked to my home security system. Also, so grateful Geek Squad offers a free class on how to use it. I plan on signing up for that soon!"
1,"I've hooked it up but just haven't signed up for the service yet, So we'll see."
1,received earlier than expected and was very happy. Will continue to buy at Best Buy in the future
1,"Amazon's ""Alexa"" program is surprisingly intuitive (and the microphone can hear me from across the house). This product worked a lot better than I initially expected it to."
1,Good and easy to buy this tablet with low price! Worth to buy
1,"The fire tablet is user-friendly, a good size, and offers many features. The display quality is good, and i have no complaints with the camera. Using Amazon for shopping or for features associated with Prime is very easy. The only issues I have had with this tablet are that my headphone jack does not provide good sound quality, and there are third-party apps that are not compatible with Fire OS. I'm hoping the app issue will be fixed by developers over time."
1,Love it!!! I can watch all my shows on it and save money by cutting off cable!!!
1,This is a great tablet. My last tablet was a Nexus (a gift) which did not really impress me. The Fire tablet has everything I need to keep myself entertained when I am on the go or recovering from a busy work week.
1,"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
1,I didn't need to review the product because I alread had one. I purchased the kindle for my wife for our anniversary and she loves it. The best part is you can read it outside in the bright sun or inside .We rarely buy paper books anymore!
1,It's a great product the sound quality is amazing.. would recommend this to all my friends
1,We purchased these for our twin 4 yr olds. These are working out great for them.
1,"It's my first e-reader ever, so I am a novice. I like my Kindle which now is a large part of my life the same way printed books have always been. It's very compact, weighs very little, has great features (touchscreen, adjustable brightness, easy to navigate and download books). The battery really lasts a long time as advertised. I just wish public libraries had more books in the Kindle format and better interface for e-books."
0,"I thought the tablet would be a little wider, its just too long"
1,Love it because it is thin and light weight and bigger
1,Great control of smart home devices. Pandora sounds great. Love the continuing improvements each week.
1,This is my second Echo that I use mostly as a Bluetooth speaker for a PC.Great sound quality for the price.
1,The Alexa assistant is more accurate than Siri as well as very responsive.
1,"After searching in multiple stores, Best Buy had the best deal for this great product. The product works flawlessly from any part of the room. The Geek Squad at Best Buy are one of the finest and best to approach for its setup."
1,I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it.
1,Nice price for all you get great product all best buy employees
0,I just prefer live TV. When you purchase these don't forget to buy an antenna so you can watch network TV and local news.
1,Fits and works with everything!
1,"Charges good, sturdy charger, feels like good quality not like the plastic feeling you get from buying from those cheap types of charger."
1,An excelente producto for a very slow price. I reccomend the tablet.
1,Purchased for my 76 year old mother and she loves it. Easy to use and she can access all apps and flow with touchscreen options Great product
0,"Very ideal for viewing movies, and th selections very updated!"
1,i love it works great! i bought my son one to he loves it i would recommend IT TO ANYONE!
1,This tablet is easy to use and a convenient size for travel.
1,I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!
1,i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
1,"I bought myself a Kindle at Best Buy and loved it so much that I decided to buy one for my daughter. Great place to buy any electronics. Staff is knowledgeable, helpful and pleasant. I buy all me electronics at Best Buy. They have good deals and price matching."
1,I love the amazon fire kids edition. It has lots of fun apps for kids.
1,My 4 Year old grandson likes to play games and watch movies. This was the best ever purchase I've done.
1,"Great pad to give the little ones a headstart to the world of tech. Very sturdy cover, nice size for little hands to grip. Very reasonable price. Great buy !!"
1,"Bought for my Mom, easy to use, simple and she can load all of her books onto her tablet."
1,This is a must buy!!!! Great picture you will enjoy this product
1,"It's a wonderful little tablet. Was going to shop around. Saw it first, thought I'd try it. Haven't used the cameras yet. I love the size. It's just what I need. I browse the internet. Shop &play games. Also watch TV programs &much more."
1,"i love it just dont waste your money to pay for geek squad to install it, it takes less than 5 min and it basically installs itself"
1,I bought this as a replacement for my original Kindle Fire I bought 4 years. ago. This has more features and many upgrades for 1/3 of the cost of original Kindle ! The technology we have now days is unbelievable ! Thanks Best Buy for a great product that I can afford !
1,"Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use."
1,I love my amazon fire stick. It goes great with my tv!
1,Good entry level reader that is easy to use. The resolution is great for that page turning novel. Has lots of other bonuses too.
1,My life with Alexa has improved so much. I could ask Alexa questions that I may have and she responds quickly....I even listen to music and I just wonder what life was before ALEXA!!!!
1,Works great. Very good sound. Does so many things.
0,Bought this tab for the $40 dollar sale price and its a nice little system. Nothing worthy of note though I have to say I am not a fan of the amazons operating system. My wife hates the inability to delete preinstalled bloatware so the home-screen is not OCD friendly.
1,this item was cheap and good in use. I had no problems with this item.
1,reat product would greatly recommend this to my Freinds
1,Easy to set up and use. The remote is sleek and functional
1,Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.
1,"Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere."
1,This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
1,Love the fire tv. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great quality content and streaming
1,Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
1,"Fast for the buck. I would give it a perfect 5 stars but the screen seems to have dead pixel after couple of use, but still great cheap for kids."
1,"For someone with extremely weak eyes, Kindle is a savior! I love reading, but reading books is stressful for my eyes, because of the font and not proper lighting all the time. With Kindle, I always have the back light and the I customize the font of each book, so it's much easier on my eyes!"
1,Got this for my 5 yr old grand child. She loves it
1,Purchased for dorm room gift. This compact cylinder packs a lot into one unit. Alexa is our go to resource. Alexa will be your trusted companion. So happy I purchased Amazon Echo.
1,I have the Kindle Paperwhite from 2013 and my fiance just got the 2015 version. It's great to see added features without a change in price!
1,"I purchased the 7"" and 8"" units at the same time. They are both nice little tablets for using the Amazon apps and cruzing the internet, but the 7"" is lacking the additional 512Mb of ram an 8Gb of storage that make the 8"" worth the additional money."
1,This is the best tablet that has ever come on the market for $49!
1,"It works, that is all that is necessary of it."
1,This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
1,Really good for reading and watching movies and playing games.
1,Amazon fire was awesome! They are cheap but they work just fine!!! This is my 2nd ones so far great for kids!
1,The amazon fire tablet is easy to use and set-up great tablet.
1,Been waiting to get ALEXA for years and not disappointed yet. It has A lot of features already and I like the fact I get weekly email about new features they are still adding.I would rate a five but nothing is perfect.
1,Great for reading in both the dark and outside. Perfect for the bookworm in your family.
1,So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.
1,I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
1,The paperwhite feature works great. Can read books in a room with low light
1,This was a great purchase. I love the size and functionality.
1,Pros: Controls the lights in our house and integrated seamlessly with the wemo app. Plays music well and sounds great as a Bluetooth speaker. We are even able to add groceries via a 3rd party app (OurGroceries).Cons: Some of the commands are a bit of a mouthful and if you don't say the command in the proper order and in a timely manner Alexa will not understand. It would be nice if you could change the default built in lists and to dos to a 3rd party app to make the commands a little easier.Overall: A little expensive for a gadget but the home automation is really fun!
1,I already had a Echo but the wife apparently liked it more than me and took it over. I bought a Dot for about $120. Less than the Echo and personally prefer that. The wife decided she wanted another Echo for the basement. They are both great and work well with my Nest thermostat. If you get one you will love it. It takes a little time to figure out the best way to ask things from it so it responds correctly the first time. Bought it on sale for $50. Off.
1,"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
1,Love it this is so much better then paying for cable TV there's so much to see you can see and even have to pay extra for it to view movies
1,Just as advertised. Bought for my mom who has poor eyesight. She loves it. Thank you.
1,"This Echo device is great. The sound is awesome, There is so much this thing can do just talk to it it talks back. One thing I have that will listen to me. Just kidding."
1,"The Echo is a great bluetooth speaker - fantastic base response. Of course, it gives you Alexa as well - which is sometimes very good - but other times disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this if you pay full price, but when Best Buy has a sale this can be a great deal."
1,I bought this as a gift for my moms birthday and she loves it. The screen size is just right and it really fast for the games she plays.
1,I'm very happy with my purchase.It arrived on time. Amazing performance.
1,"This tablet is great for the price. We ended up purchasing 6 of them. It is great for the kids and is very functional. I think the price helped lower my stress level where the kids are concerned, but it is very sturdy. Would purchase again."
0,Don't like that Amazon has so many ads going on this thing. Makes it pretty not fun to use.
1,My son is 3 and he loves this tablet. It is very educational and worth the money
1,"This is my first e-reader, and I generally like it. The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read. I'm very accustomed to using 8+ inch tablets, so a 6"" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books."
1,"I love my Alexa.She is smart,convienient and fun.I am still learning new things about her."
0,Tablet is very well built for 49.99 . Only issue is the speed of the processor
1,"I have bought 2 of these, one for my 4 yr old and one for my 6 yr old. Both of them have previously broken tablets before. I am amazed how well these have stood up to them and how well they perform. A super deal for a tablet. I likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they're smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my iPad. Just a forewarning, the kindle store can be a little wonky and less streamlined in aligning purchases. I wish there was a restore purchases button like in the Apple Store since I've bought stuff in games to have the content disappear... I'm sure if I were less lazy I could call customer support though :)"
1,My son has the vacuuming chore. He loves his new toy! It is light and seems to 'walk' itself.
1,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
1,Great for kids just learning to use a tablet for the first time.
1,I brought this item for my grandson and I know that he will really enjoy it and it was a great price.
0,"A nice size with many perks, like a crisp screen & fun vibrant colored outer shell. However the pop up ads are annoying."
1,I bought this not knowing if I would like it.LUVIT
1,Very convienent and works like a charm! The children enjoy playing games on it too.
1,Great value for an awesome gadget. Love it so much
1,This is the best gift a reader can receive. Easy to use.
1,The only bad thing about Alexa is you have to down load apps for her to do things . She is getting smarter by the day as long as I put the apps in . But she is fun .
1,"A good friend of mine got into transforming Fire Sticks and Fire TV two Kodi boxes. He brought over his Fire TV and led us use it and afterwards my wife was convinced that we needed to have one. With Fire TV it makes Kodi stream smoothly and the menus are quick. I love that I can have Netflix, other apps, and other programs installed all on one unit."
1,For $49 this tablet is an incredible value!!This is the best solution ever for kids
1,"Love it! Ask Alexa and you shall receive! Music, news, local weather! Great!"
1,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
0,Not the best and the brightest in the market. Bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month. Best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair. Good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long.
1,Love this fire stick and the ability to display a much crisper and clearer picture
1,The kiddos love this tablet! I bought a different brand last year and it lasted less than 2 months. This is still going strong at 5+ months.
1,Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
1,"Couldn't wait for my son to open his Kindle Paperwhite. for Christmas. He was thrilled to get it. But, powering it up he found out it was lighter, more versatile and enjoyable to use. One of the best.gifts I've given."
1,The paperwhite is so cool. I don't know why I didn't get it sooner.
1,Installed easily however little documentation for total setup and individual preferences. Loads of features and uses would be nice if documentation was included with purchase. However how to books can be found in the internet.
1,It was a birthday gift for my son. He loves it and I use it from time to time. I would recommend it and the price is nice.
1,I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
1,"This is an easy to use, inexspensivd tablet for kids. Great for basic tasks and games."
1,"I purchased 7 of these tablets on black friday. We have enjoyed them a lot. I was worried about the clarity of games, since they aren't hd. But, they are fantastic. Lots of free books, apps, games. Very happy with my purchase"
1,"Very nice table, for a very good price. Very good for reading, browsing, and basic functions.A little slow overall. And I also miss some better features related to the different profiles we can create. For example, we can create different profiles for kids, but can't put a password to each one of them (at least, I didn't find how to do it)."
1,"Easy to use, compact, and great sound. Set up was very easy"
1,This item works great!Great speaker sound & works great with voice commands .
1,great product for entertainment and having all your accounts in one
1,Really like this allows me to set reminders and listen to Sirius radio. Easy to set up
1,"Love it!!! My amazon prime membership keeps on giving... amazon shopping first, amazon TV next... now now fire tablet.. wow.... free movies and books download... and this tablet can handle it. at lower price point than HD. i was worried about its screen.. but, you know what? it still looks good. i guess when i look at it side by side with my other galaxy tab, i can see the difference. But, when i just watch this, it looks great. I have been watching HD TV for awhile now. So, if it is bad, i will know. this one is still pretty good."
1,Took me a few times to get used to it and now I love this Kindle!
1,This a great product. I would buy this again for a gift for myself.
1,I was looking everywhere for this because I lost my charger for my fire stick and i finally found it at best buy. It was a great price and works perfectly!
1,"I checked reviews and ratings for the echo for a long while but was still hesitant about purchasing it. I didn't see the value in this product despite all the good reviews and ratings. I was convinced to purchase it at best buy when I saw it and it was out for display, my wife and I immediately started to test it. it was convincing because it was loud in the store but still the echo was crisp and loud. once we took it home we set it up and it was even better with all the features that this comes with. we use many of them. I like how it is built and how much it does. the echo is very helpful and now we are about to buy a couple more for around the house."
1,"This is my second Kindle device. I enjoy using this to read in lower light conditions with the automatic adjustment. Touch screen is nice, but can accidentally move pagesif your fingers slip. No issues with readability in many light conditions."
1,Purchased for my 75 year old mom so she could adjust the font size and find the books for her book club less expensively
1,"Best Home Automation Assistant, Got It For $80 During One Day Sale. Will Recommend"
1,Cheap but very awesome tablet. It has everything that you need
1,"Good product, needs a few more things added on but works very well"
1,Recommended by staff member when I asked for help. Love the size and ease of use. Just what I was looking for.
1,"Overall the Echo is a fun product to own. We typically use it for listening to music, finding out about the weather forecast, or having her tell corny jokes. Eventually we'll start linking it to wifi thermostats, but that hasn't happened yet."
1,"These tablets are a great value -- theyre perfect for kids or users who just want to browse the web, read, etc. They are not the most powerful but for the price they're an amazing deal.PS use a search engine and learn how to sideload Android apps. The Amazon store is a bit limited and missing some popular apps. Sideloading removes that problem all together."
1,The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with many free apps for kids. I set parental controls to prevent internet access. My only issue is that the Amazon App Store doesn't offer the YouTube Kids app. Other than that he's had the the tablet for about 4 mths & we've had no issues.
1,"Worth the purchase, makes watching shows easy plug and play"
1,I use this all the time at home. Usually for radioandpod casts. Alexa usually understands me and does what I ask.
1,The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.
1,"I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play. Overall, a great product for a really great price!!"
1,Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.
1,Crystal clear screen. Easy to use. Reading for day/night excellent!
1,The best thing I bought . I kicked My cable provider out and got this. It was he ebay thing I did
1,lightweight and easy to read indoor or outdoors no light to full light.
1,"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet."
1,"Replaced my older (lost during recent move) version. Must admit this model is faster, has more storage and a camera! Love it"
1,"User friendly, affordable, nice features, good battery life"
1,This product is fun & easy to use. It's good fun for the whole Family. There have been a few issues with connecting nest & hue but once I received the proper guidance it was a breeze.
1,In my opinion the fire tv is definitely one of the best streaming devices out there with its awesome performance and easy to use.
1,Great tablet but doesn't hold a charge for a long needs a better battery but overall it's a good tablet
1,Highly recommended.Good quality product very good for streaming your favorite shows and movies.
1,"I had purchased the fire stick,but then decided to upgrade to the fire TV for more memory space and faster wifi."
1,I love this little critter!
1,This has been a great purchase. It fits all my tablet and e-reader needs.
1,"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
1,"Bought the Echo for my hubby's birthday, and it is everything I expected. It is so easy to set up, and we enjoy it so much. We use it to play music (such as a certain genre or artist or particular song). The sound quality is very good. My grandkids love to hear their songs too. We use it to make our shopping list, as it's easy to add things whenever you think of them, and no lists to lose! I definitely would recommend the Amazon Echo."
1,Brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on. She loves it.
1,We love our kindles. They are very sturdy compared to pricier tablets.
0,It's good and fast. It does what you want it for. I use it mainly for reading and my son plays a few games on it. Alright product.
1,Just plug in and go. Very easy to use right out of the box. Speaker seems to be great quality.
1,I love the Kindle Paperwhite!! It allows you to read in any type of situation. You can control how bright or dim the backlight is. You can also turn the backlight off to save battery when you're in a well lit area. It's got plenty of space for hundreds of books.
1,Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price
0,"It works but it takes a while to do anything. But for the price, it's good enough for the kids."
1,"It's everything you can ask for in a tablet. The only downfall was the camera, but at a price like that, you get what you pay for."
1,"Alexa is my new best friend. I was able to set up the Amazon Echo rather quickly. It was harder to unpack the device than to set it up. I love to listen to the music and play jeopardy. I can even ask Alexa to turn on my lights, you need a smart plug to do this it is an added cost but worth it."
1,Amazon fire tv is a great product. It turns any tv into a smart tv. I watch all my movies and tv shows with the fire tv.
0,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
1,good value for the money ..............................................................................................................
1,"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."
0,"Sometimes you have to be very specific on where to find the information. For example, if Alexa does not know the answer, I have to tell her to look in Wikimedia"
1,Bought the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet on a BF whim while standing in the checkout line. Glad I did. Nice and compact. Fast. I'm using it daily and finding I can do more with it than I thought I could.
1,This item was on sale and I bought it cheaper than on Amazon with the features it's a great buy
1,My whole family loves it! We love listening to music. Alexa eill search for so many things on the net :-). We even programmed the cofee machine to turn on qith Alexa!! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I wish it also spoke Spanish.
1,"The Amazon fire Tv is an all around great product for a great price. It is a little more expensive compared to the Fire stick but it is well worth the price difference. The Fire Tv offers 4k compability and also seems to be a little faster. It allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such as Netflix, Hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my PS4. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who has paid subscription it works well with them and let you view them all in one place."
1,"Alexa is super easy to set up. Works great even if you're not a Amazon Prime member, but if you have Prime the added benefits are awesome! I added this to my echo dot."
1,Great purchase. quick speed lots of choices to watch and cheap !
1,Home assistant x bluetooth speaker. Alexa is awesome!
1,Really good product voice commands work a lot better than expected. Even just using it as a speaker I feel like I got my moneys worth.
1,Bought for one of my granddaughters. It was easy for me to get setup and off she went. Kids are too smart these days.
1,"This tablet is the perfect size and so easy to use. Read, play games or any other purpose--it is great!"
1,"Holds a charge, easy to use, all in all great tablet."
1,"Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid. If you're a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on."
1,"After visiting my Nephew up in Portland, Or were he introduced the fire stick to me I couldn't wait to get back to Phoenix to purchase one but after talking with the sales clerk I decided to get the Fire TV and enrolled Amazon Prime happy that I did."
1,It's perfect for reading and even watching movies. The only thing that is not so great is taking pictures with the tablet. They do not come out as clear as I would like them. But overall perfect for what I use it for. That's mostly reading and watching movies.
1,"I am a Flight Attendant and I love this small sleek book!!!! It is a must have. The only thing I would change is, I would add audio"
1,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
1,Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
1,Very good product at a very good price. I bought this product as an affordable table option for my son.
1,This is such a great product! I am learning new things to use my Alexa for each day! The games she plays are fun and I especially like how she connects to all of our smart devices to voice control them! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!
1,"Nice interface, easy to use. Smooth, no buffering."
1,I bought this for a gift and the receiver loves it. It's so easy to read.
1,"great item, if my hands are tied up, I can ask alexa about the weather or sports even songs with out the touch of a button"
1,I would recommend this for kids ages 6 to 10. They can play al kinds of games that can be downloaded
1,"My niece loves this tablet. It did not take her very long to learn the apps, how to download apps, visit wifi and etc. Thanks"
0,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
1,I wanted them to have a tablet and after reading the reviews and price of the Amazon Fire; I was very pleased.
1,Very happy with it. Set up was fast and easy. Worth the price
1,Bought one at the store and liked it so got one for my daughter inlaw for Christmas
1,For my son. He loves it. Has it tied into electronics in his room.
1,I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.
1,Great product and great service from bestbuy online
1,"Works well when it works...sometimes it seem not to want to ""wake"" up"
1,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.
1,This is a very good starter tablet for anyone wanting to mess with one without breaking the bank. Everything runs and looks great from videos to games to books. Only thing that I feel could push people away is the app store(uses Amazon's). Otherwise this is great.
1,"It's been solid so far. Can get a little glitchy every now and then, the text isn't as high a quality as it could look, and it may bother some people that not all apps from Apple and Google are available on the Amazon App Store. But for the price I think it's a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing, email, music, videos, etc."
1,Makes life easier. I have several smart home products including nest devices and hue lights. Alexa lets me control them all with my voice. And I don't even have to shout. Even if across the room.
1,My son and I love the tablet. Works great! Thanks!
1,"It's really amazing to know that when I think of a task, I can ask and it be accomplished. Looking forward to integrating the Echo into my lifestyle."
1,I chose this to check email and Facebook because I don't have a smartphone. It's a lot quicker than getting on my laptop. I use it for YouTube and Pandora also. My only complaint is my old eyes struggle with the smaller print. I am pleased with it!
1,This is the first time I buy a kindle product. And the price is fairly good since I get the 20 discount! The screen reads like real papers. But the background light I think is not necessary because it will reduce the quality of reading.
1,"A kindle is great you can do alot on it reading books, getting on the internet, playing games just like a tablet."
1,This product is very easy to use and we are very happy to have it.
1,Get one!! She gets smarter every day.. I've had echo for a few months and love it
1,This is a great light weight android tablet. It works well for most things that I wanted to use it for. I wanted to see if it would work for board packets but decided that the form factor is too small. As a reader and light weight table it works great. At this price it is a great buy.
1,great table for kids and parents control great gre
1,I had a 1st gen fire. Battery started getting week after 4 years. Bought this as a replacement. I like the expandable SD slot and the camera. Much better than the first at 20% of the price.
1,"We have several Alexa units throughout our home and love the way it will control lights, TV, and Thermostats."
1,"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
1,Love this Kindle paperwhite!! It is easily carried in my purse!!
1,"Nice and easy on the eyes, lightweight. What I take on trips to read outside or at home anytime."
1,This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.
1,I have found Alexa (echo) to be indispensable. I use her for my alarm clock. I play music to go to sleep at night using the sleep timer so the music shuts off by itself. And I use the weather skills several times a day. I just love this device.
1,"Handy size, easy to read in all situations and we can even send other documents than books to it."
1,Purchased for toddler to watch movies and stuff. He loves the apps that are available.
1,Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!
1,I love tge size of the tablet. I can store it in my bookbag and go about my way.
1,She is loving being able to play all the games that we can download. Easy to use and the perfect size.
1,Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.
1,If you are in doubt about spending the extra money to buy the Voyage... don't be. If it hadn't been a gift I would have most like not spent the money but after using it I am so glad I have this one.
0,"flips between Prime, Netflix, and Hulu quickly and easily & lot more"
1,Watch amazon prime and netflix on it for cheap. What else do you need from a tablet that costs under $50.
1,Very fun and informational tool to have. Bought this for my wife but everyone loves it!
1,This item is great for me and my family. We recently have started looking for innovative ways to watch television and found this product beneficial!
0,"Used it for 2 days and the screen froze 5 times--the kindle just won't switch on. Had to restart each time, and sometimes restarting won't help. It is clearly defective. Brought it to a Bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more?? Got a refund in the end even though I liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. I guess purchases with discounts are not protected."
1,"We weren't crazy about the idea of getting another portable electronic device that distracted her from her schoolwork. 5th graders need to read much more than previous years and the Paperwhite not only encourages reading but eliminates the clutter that occurs from many paperbacks. The screen is the perfect size, lighting more than adequate, and the functionality is ideal."
1,Amazon fire tab is good for begineers or for kids. Memory and disk gets occupied soon. Suitable for fewer apps.
1,$50 for a tablet is amazing. It does what it needs to do with not alot if frills.
1,Works Great! Love the screen sharpness. Very easy to use.
0,Great tablets for everyday use. My child watches his favorite YouTube videos on it.
1,"I really enjoy amazon fire tv I get to watch Netflix, amazon prime movies and games. It has a very affordable price for a small box."
1,"This is a great product and for the cost, it exceeded my expectations! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to carry their book collection all in one device."
1,"I never thought I would make the switch from actual books to electronic media but I don't regret it, not for one minute! With all the free books I have already downloaded I will be reading for a lo-o-o-o-o-o-ong time!! I'm adding new books every day and the options are endless! And....I don't have to have the light on at night to read in bed anymore! Love, love, love my Kindle!"
1,"Got this for one of my foster kids, he just love it. He cried when he received it. Another satisfied customer. Yea for the Carter home."
1,"I love this little tablet, it fits right in my pocketbook without adding a lot of weight. It's easy to use and I can do almost anything on it. I highly recommend it."
0,It contains too many adds that cant be removed including the lock screen its not worth the money
1,"I love the paperwhite! It took me a long time to get used to an e-reader, but the paperwhite won me over. The battery lasts forever. It has a light so you can read in bed. Font size is adjustable. It's SO lightweight, and it feels good in your hand. Great on your eyes. Easy to use. You can bring all the books you want with you when you travel. I have an android tablet, and an ipad, and I prefer to read the kindle paperwhite. No contest!"
1,Does everything I need. Can watch movies and read books.
1,I haven't used this yet but I knew I wanted one so I don't have to use my computer every time I want to charge my e-reader.
0,Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.
1,"Great product, easy set up, easy to hide but pleasant to look at. Works great but have not found any content that was Dolby digital. Picture is nice"
1,Perfect size for doing everything!Multiple accountss- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids a.Battery llife is amazing Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great
1,Ive always been a fan of mad max and this game surely is satisfying! Pure action at its best!
1,Great product for when you are on the go.great sound
1,I am studying for my MA and the amount of books that this decree is going to require will be increditable. This alleviates me from having to buy more book cases.
1,Not a bad display for the price. AMAZON ads pop up
1,Keeps up with my appointments e-mails and all sorts of things I love it !
1,I got rid of cable for this and trust and believe it is worth it.
0,"I was expecting a tablet good enough for the kids to play and download games, and I was told at BB that this product would work for these basic needs. It seems like everything I download needs to be through my Amazon account, very few items are for free, and everything takes forever to download and/or open. Wish I could return it!"
1,My son has enjoyed using this to read books and stream the internet. The price was great too!
1,"It is super quick, alot faster than 2014 version. Alot better video quality imo"
1,"It is okay I guess, but not very user friendly. I probably wouldn't recommend to a friend for this reason"
1,Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
1,This was a gift and they love it so much that I think I will get more
1,This is the best of all kindles- affordable and easier to read. The backlight option is good to read in dark.
1,Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
1,"I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price"
1,This Product is Unique and does most of my work in home. I love it..
1,Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around
1,We like the Fire better than Roku. We also prefer the ease of use over the funtionality of our new Sony 4K TV.
1,Great deal for the cost. Would purchase item again.
1,"Echo is learning everyday and its uses daily, i use it in place of a speaker and connect my phone to it."
0,"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!"
0,I got 6 of them they didn't have google plus me no like
1,This makes for a great house warming present for anyone who loves tech! Definitely want to buy one for myself.
1,"No issues. Love this tablet, so glad we bought it."
1,Bought for my niece she loves it !! Easy to use and good size.
1,"we have enjoyed using this from the day that we purchased it. It is not only useful for everyday, but is a wonderful addition to any party setting."
1,"With a 300+ book library, I'm an avid reader. But when you're teaching a 1200-page behemoth, carting it around becomes a bit of a burden. With the Kindle, it weighs almost nothing. Plus with the Paperwhite, I can read when the wife goes to sleep without getting kicked out because of lamplight! Love it"
0,"Liked it a lot,, Liked it a lot, liked it a lot!!!"
1,It works really well with my Amazon prime and Nest
1,"I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet"
1,The Amazon - Fire TV is easy to learn and wonderful customer service they will walk you throw any thing you need help with.
1,"It's perfect for me, my husband and my daughterthere are so many apps we downloaded, Sling, Nick Jr, Disney, CNN etc.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider ""passes through"" the HBO, Netflix, etc"
1,I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good.
1,"One of the best products to have, save so much money on the long run. I use this instead of having cable and it works even better. It's half the cost of one monthly cable bill and I have access to 100x more channels. You will need one amazon tv box per tv unless you don't mind moving it from the living room to the bedroom."
1,Easier to navigate to find what your looking for. A lot of selections to choose from
1,Great product and price service in the store could have been better
1,"Love all things I can do with Alexis, games, info."
1,It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
1,Very satisfied. Great coverage. Easy to set up. Never misses motion.
1,I cut my cable and move to Playstation Vue. Amazon fire tv boxes are fast and picture quality is amazing. I purchase 4 boxes for the whole house.
1,i would and have told people to get one if they have a 4k tv
1,Really cool and useful. Kids love it also. Sound quality is good enough considering size and other capabilities.
1,"I refuse to buy cable, and I was using my computer to stream shows. This was interfering with my homework. I decided to try the stick out, but due to the upgrades they were out. I bought the box instead. I am so happy with my purchase. It doesn't overheat or get slow or have any of the problems the stock has."
1,I love my kindle fire. It is a 16 GB but I change it to 32GB.
1,"I enjoy using this, it has a wonderful Ultra HD picture quality. I picked this version for use with Sling TV or Playstation Vue."
1,Had the fire TV stick and this is much faster with better picture quality.
1,"I bought this tablet for my dad for Christmas and he loved it! I had to show him how to use it (of course), but now he has the hang of it!! Great buy!"
1,"THOUGHT I GIVE IT TRY,SO FAR IT DOES THE JOB FOR WHAT I NEEDGOOD FOR THE PRICE!"
1,This was very easy to set up & use. The speaker has great sound.
1,Price for the device was a great deal and the assistance provided by employees was great.
1,Very good for the price. Would buy it again for sure.
1,"Great for using in any condition, specifically outside in the sun. No glare like the iphone and ipad"
1,"I love Alexa, she has gotten me in trouble from ordering from Amazon but still love the Echo.Every week it seems like she can do more. If you're a Amazon Prime member it's a great device."
1,If you don't have high expectations this is a good deal for the price.
1,My granddaughter loves it uses it a lot helps with her homework
1,This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
1,"Very responsive. I purchased the Phillips light bulbs and Alexa controls them, brightness and color. Learning what Alexa can do takes time but well worth the effort."
1,"Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long."
1,I purchased this device to interface with Lutron lighting system and a harmony hub remote for my entertainment system and I couldn't be happier. Work great!!
1,"Great product for home automation, music, news, weather"
1,it was mainly purchased for reading in dark. it does not irritate eyes when used in night without light
1,"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works."
1,light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images
1,This is a great product. Battery life is very good. Great for reading at night and works great in sun light. Sign up through Amazon and get books cheap or free.
1,"Really good, does what is described. Was at good price."
1,The Fire TV was purchased for our living room and we primarily use it for watching Playstation Vue and Netflix. We already had a Fire Stick for my daughter's bedroom which we have found to be painfully slow. The Fire TV is a completely different experience - great performance and completely worth the extra money over the Fire Stick.
1,"The Amazon Echo is a wonderful addition to my house. I can listen to the music i like, when I want to. I am still learning about all of its other wonderful qualities."
1,I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
1,I'm very happy with the improvement made to the fire tv. I'll definitely recommend this box to all my friends.
1,"This is a great device for those who are looking for time savings throughout the day. I am still learning how to use the Echo, but I have the basics down. You can ask about the weather, news briefings, jokes, play music etc. So far so good."
1,"Fun to use, it opens your world to a whole new way of interacting with tech."
1,I love it it was a gift for my niece she uses it a lot to extreme movies battery holds up very well
1,"This Amazon Tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. I purchased them for Christmas gifts this year (2016) and when I saw them, Grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. I did so, because last year when I tried to get one, Everybody was sold out !!! Not 1 to be had !!"
1,My son loves the kindle we got for him. It's perfect for the little guys to watch Netflix on.
1,Love my Amazon FireTv Stick. Bought one for my whole family.
1,I use this while im at work to have a bigger screen to watch my shows on. However I prob dont really need it. It has most apps. Not all games thatbi use on my phone. Its big and nice screen. Resolution is very nive. However i hardly use it besides work. When I'm at home i iust use my phone. I gave it a 4* due to not having all apps or games available. The wifi signal doesnt pick up as well as my phone either.
1,So far so good. Having an issue with one of them freezing. Might have to use it
1,"Love the shopping list feature, weather report, time, listening to favorite music."
1,Amazon is a great product. Use with Prime and get shopping benefits!
1,"This is an excellent product, recommend to everyone"
1,My daughter had been asking for a tablet she loved it and since likes to watch movies and play games and take a bunch of pictures i like that you can expand the memory up to 128 gigs.
1,Was bought for my parents who are getting older and this can assist them with lights and everything
1,"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
1,We have only had our fire stick for a few weeks but we love it so far! There's so many options and the quality is wonderful.
1,I am enjoying this product very much. great buy!!!
1,Duarable and very handy. Good start for beginners and can add the protective case for kids
1,Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
1,Very good buy for the money had 2 months and works great
1,Not knowing much about the fire tv I did my research and when I got it home it was even better than I expected!
1,Echo is the best way to have any songs (over a million) with just one command to Alexa. All the many features make for a wonderful piece of technology enjoyed by all ages. So helpful and entertaining!!!Love it!
1,This is a great tablet. It keeps my kid occupied for hours if I need to.
1,"It would be nice if it had a text list of books, like my old kindle. The cover graphics are too small to read. This is the only reason for four stars, and not five. Other than that, I like this better because of the great resolution and contrast, as well as the built in LED's for reading at night."
1,If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
1,This is a great entry-level tablet for someones first tablet.
1,Easy to readNo eye strainLong battery lifeSimple to useInterfaces well with computerNot for web browsingVery ergonomicLightweightSturdy
1,Convenient reliable product. If you need a product that can give you immediate response to your daily needs this is it!
1,This is an amazing product doesn't matter if u buy for a kid or an adult either one will absolutely love it I have 2 !!! Totally recommend it
1,I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.
1,This product is so easy to set up and use. The sound quality is amazing.
1,Excellent tablet at an exceptional price. I highly recommend this tablet.
1,Great for reading anytime of day. Size is perfect.
0,I really wanted this as a Christmas present however it's nothing like the ads. Alexa works sometimes and then not. I can't get her to play music or listen to the radio through her. Very disappointed. Plan on taking it back.
1,"This came in handy when our computer had to go to the pc hospital. It was convenient, quick, easy to use!"
1,It is a very good product with great quality. Good
1,This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.
0,"The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection."
1,Very good value for the money. The kids love them! Easy to set up and use.
1,I bought this for myself because i play my kindle long periods of time and now i can play while it is charging wouldn't be without it i can sit on my favorite chair and cord still reaches as it did not before.
1,"Great price and bargain, especially if you have Amazon prime it works well with it"
1,"Picked this up for my wife, Wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentals/reading from Amazon. $49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on Black Friday as it was only $34.99.The Tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use Bluetooth.Screen resolution is very good for a budget 7"" screen. Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive. Also comes with a trial of Amazon PRIME.Would definitely buy again."
1,Echo performs well when she understands the question asked. I find myself often repeating questions because Alexa doesn't get it right.
1,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite because my existing Kobo Vox e-reader could not be read in the sun, which I get a lot of in Naples, FL. Excellent e-reader!"
1,I am purchasing this tablet for my younger cousin as a starter tablet. But we will see how well it holds up with his rigorous activity and game playing.
1,"This was purchased as a gift for my son. Now I'm thinking of getting two more, one for me and one for my other son. So need I say more. If I had this in my own home I probably would have given it 5 stars. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't used it first hand"
1,Best part about this unit is it works with KODI. Easy to setup and use. The remote is small and easy to understand. For the price I would highly recommend this above all the others.
1,I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
1,Perfect for what my 8 year old uses this for. Watching programs and playing learning games.
1,such big sound from a tiny cylinder . I originally purchased to only listen to music but end up loving the technology and use the Alexa features almost everyday!
1,"Smaller than I expected but easy to hold. Very difficult to figure out how to access library, delete books. No user instructions came with it."
1,"I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!"
1,"Watching the ads in the beginning, I was skeptical on how useful the Echo would truly be in my life; but once I opened it and spent a little time adding things like ""skills"" (which you find in the app and can enhance Alexa beyond belief), I quickly realized how much I LOVE this device! I have it hooked up with my Harmony remote (a Logitech product) that I purchased from Best Buy, along with any and all other accounts I have, such as Pandora, iHeart Radio, etc., and now I find myself asking Alexa to do almost everything; i.e., ""Alexa, play some _____ (artist) station"", to ""Alexa, turn on my Blu-Ray Player/ TV/ Apple TV/ Radio"". This device I can truly see is the beginning of where home technology is headed."
1,"I purchased this simply for reading kindle books. I was able to get it with a reward certificate for $40. It's biggest issue is glare, more so in the sunlight. I bought an anti-glare screen protector and it made a huge difference, but it is still difficult to read in the sun. I'm still very happy with the product."
1,This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good. All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.
1,It's very fast and has great picture and for the price you can't beat it
1,"Great streaming device, and at a fantastic price. Forget the fire-stick get the fire-tv"
1,"I had two kindles previously, I think 3rd gen white one with keyboard, cheapest kindle I won couple years back from a raffle, and finally purchased this paper white. So much easier on my eyes and my wife doesn't get bothered by a little bit of light it produces. I was a casual reader who reads one book every quarter and with paper white I read 1-2 books a month minimum."
1,Excelente !!
1,"For the price I was skeptical, but this thing can do everything!!"
1,Cool little device that tells you almost anything you want to know. Music sounds good as well!
1,This device is incredible. It can pick up on your voice from across the room and has yet to make a mistake about what I asked.
1,"Bought Echo with Alexa and my family loves the entertainment. You ask Alexa and You get music, and answers for almost everything. Best thing of all was the great sale of $90 off price. You get free entertainment at its best. Will recommend for families or for individuals. You won't be disappointed. Amazon created a monster."
1,This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours.
1,"Great product for the price but make sure to purchase a separate SIM card, 8GB fills up fast."
1,This is a great purchase. It is easy to use. I will definitely recommend it to other people.
1,I purchased this to replace the Ereader I had. It has done that and so much more.
1,Excellent for my loving kids and more easily to use by them.
1,Just love my new tablet. I have had a kindle fire for 4 years and it was messing up badly so I needed a new one badly.
1,My grandkids love these tablets.They are easy for them and they are having a great time with them
1,I recommend this and the Apple TV. They are both great products. I like the voice remote. Plus if you have Amazon prime. You can you Prime tv.
1,LOVE my Kindle Fire. Functions well and is a great and cheaper tablet alternative. Does everything I would want a tablet for at a much more reasonable price.
1,"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day."
1,"This unit has a powerful processor, load contents very quick and stream the movie so smooth."
1,Easy to scroll through the menu t watch what you want.just less the price of others
1,I enjoy reading ebooks on this tablet as well as watching videos. It's just so handy to carry around in my purse.
1,Great for my four year old. She is able to access all her learning games with ease.
1,Ordered online. Quick delivery and easy set up. Works great
1,Its is a great product.Fast and reliable.Streaming and services are the best
1,Fast and easy to use. Downloading apps is convenient.
1,Was hesitate to order this because I thought it might be difficult to hook up. Step by step instructions from the app and the echo was so easy to set up. Volume is spectacular!! Amazing what you can ask Alexa...still learning and playing. Love it so much I ordered another dot for the bedroom.
0,Good buy for the price. Easy to surf the web a lot of apps in the App Store
1,I wanted to find a way to stream The Grand Tour and the Fire TV works great. Our first streaming experience- very easy to use with Amazon Prime and high speed internet.
1,If you are a Amazon prime member it's a must have even if your not you will love this I got the 4 k one could not be happier
0,"Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average."
1,I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it
1,"If you're expecting something like an iPad, leave your expectations at the door. This is a great little tablet for losing track of time while you read, play a game, connect with family/friends, or watch a show. I've had iPads for years, and have loved using them--just getting tired of the price tags that come with them."
1,"Got this for our home gym to stream workout guides, Netflix, and music if - Super fast streaming, great quality build and performance, love the Alexa remote and integration with Amazon prime - all the apps and content u could ask for - haven't use the free time parental controls but that will be for our third one of these!"
1,"Brought this for my son for xmas, he loved it and was very happy with it."
1,"Love this item, faster and better than firestick and other devices"
1,"I got this for my mom to use as her ""computer"" and I am so happy with it. It's ease of use and ability to store pics for my mom is a big plus. Thanks !!!!"
1,great idea will recommend to everyone just can't stop playing with it
1,Much better than a fire stick. Well worth the extra money.
1,"Purchased for my 9 year old. Great for kids. Ads on lock screen are annoying and battery life is not as I'd like, and takes a long time to fully charge. Must prepare and charge overnight."
1,"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
1,My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!
1,Easy to get started with usefulFeatures. As I learn of new skills and try them Alexa gets more entertaining. Efficient and helpful assistant.
1,This was the 4th one I purchased and I love them. My grandkids play on them for hours and I get to choose what games they can play.
1,"I love everything about this item. I can watch whatever, whenever, particularly on Kodi. Good bye and good riddance to cable!"
1,"Bought this item for easy access to music and our family uses it for everything wether, news, grocery lists etc."
0,Bought it on thanksgiving night just opened pkg and the screen is crushed. Haven't been able to take it back but was told when I called in that they might not have any in stock.
1,"For the price this thing cannot be beat. It does more than expected, very pleased."
1,"This is third Kindle product and the size, battery life and readability have improved with each new generation. Very happy with product and will continue to purchase in the future as new versions become available."
1,"Easy way to listen news, weather and traffic in the morning. My husband listen Pandora."
1,"I bought this as an alternative to my previous rechargeable Bluetooth speaker. Seemed like every time I went to use it the battery was dead. Echo is always plugged in and ready to go, and the interface is an added bonus. For $4 a month I subscribed to Amazon unlimited and just request Alexa to play songs to my hearts desire. I use it as a clock to wake me up in the morning, and control my lights! Highly recommended!"
1,"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and its FANTASTIC! Its durable and very user friendly! Love all all the free educational games, movies & books!"
1,Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
1,bought as a gift and they loved it. it works fast and good
0,Truly I should have tried to get a refund. I threw out the packaging before I realized how poorly it works. This charger only works every third day when held at a particular angle. The planets almost need to align for it to charge my Kindle. Complete disappointment.
1,Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
1,"I researched and researched and researched streaming boxes from so many companies, including Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, and other off brands. By far, the Amazon TV was the best option for flexibility and reliability. I currently have three boxes now for each of my TVs and run PlayStation Vue. I have cut my cable bill by almost $70 per month. Plus, I now have the flexibility of other movie apps, Amazon content, and much more. The switch to streaming TV took less than 30 minutes. What a great investment with a very quick return."
1,Got the Echo for my husband who just loves it. I think it has become his best friend
1,Did not think I would like this product. I now own two!
1,My 3 yr old granddaughter loves this item! PERFECT
1,It is a good product. Didn't want glare when I read. It serves the purpose
1,Awesome for kids. Great for parents (peace and quiet) lol
1,"Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
1,Extremely easy to set up using the Alexa app on your phone. Outstanding voice recognition. Was able to be in a different room of my house and still be able to command it. Great speaker quality as well!
1,I was very satisfied with this tablet. It was priced really cheaply but it is a decent little tablet.
1,Very easy to use. Great for travel. Access to many many movies.
1,I love it would recommend it .. Works great and takes really good pic
1,Faster than the firestick I definitely would buy another one much better than Google Chrome
1,I'm a cable cutter and Amazon Fire TV has been a God send. I have more content now than with cable. Highly recommend this producg.
1,"The box works great it is compact, easy to install and all around easy to navigate. The only reason I did not give the full star rating is that my remote keeps giving out. It will work most the time then it will just stopped I have replaced the batteries. That's not the issue I actually have to take the batteries out and put them back in to some times get the remote working again. I am hoping getting the remote replaced will be easy and hassle free"
1,"I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality."
1,Very happy with my product. Best Buy staff was extremely helpful
1,"I had an original Kindle (wifi only) and loved it, however was limited when reading at night (I didn't want to have to attach a light or use a flashlight). The Kindle Paperwhite solves my dilemma! I would specifically recommend it for those who are frequent fliers."
1,The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.
1,"I had the Fire stick, and the performance was sluggish at best, constant buffering and powering off. I upgraded to the Fire tv and the difference is night and day. I don't know why I waited! no issues thus far and I couldn't be happier."
1,everything is cool with Echo but the sound quality can be made better for sure. Also there needs to be way to equalize volume as needed.
1,"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
1,"Amazon makes an amazing product that turns any tv into a smart TV. Slim, sleek and extremely easy to install and use."
1,This purchase opened up so many options for viewing that we didn't have before. Easy to install and operate.
1,We got this tablet for our son to use in school and it's perfect for just that. At the right price too.
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter and she really loves it!
1,I no longer have cable nor do I need it now that I have the firestick!
1,I would recommend this product great for web photo bible studying video tango and some much more.. Go and get you one trust me you would love it..
1,"I purchased the item for $33 and was shocked when I began using it that the battery lasted 10 hours with moderate use, came with 6 months of free newspaper subscription and was preloaded with a lot of features. Its not the fastest in the world and I would prefer more storage, but for the price and considering how well it works I'm giving it 4 stars."
1,I had got the original for the wife she finally needed a new one so when I saw this online I had to get her a new one she loves it
1,"great for reading outside in the sun, or in dark rooms. very easy on the eyes."
1,"Has game selections, most my kids play. Great for daily use!"
1,this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
1,"Traveling in coach is horrible, so I was looking for a small light weight dedicated device that allowed me to focus on reading. This product is perfection. I've read several books on various iPhones, including my 7+ over the years, but they're nothing like the paper white display."
1,"Really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. A big part of my life. I use at on the train, on my breaks at work, at home."
1,We debated in getting the larger or smaller screen and I'm glad we went with the larger one. My son uses it every day and loves it!
1,Does what is says and more. Although initially somewhat complicated to get things going.
1,The Amazon Echo is a great friend in the room who will play whatever music you ask for. It's great to just ask Alexa and the echo responds accurately.
0,Ok overall but brakes easily with obly one fall to the floor
1,"We have a tv that already has Netflix and Amazon but still wanted all our other apps that you just can get on other devices. We love this this thing and highly recommend it just ask Alexa for stuff instantly you have music, movies, and shopping."
0,Little disappointed in. Item very hard to turn off but it is easier to read.
1,you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music
1,I got this for my mother who isn't very tech savvy as I needed to get her something to get use to touch screens and smart devices. Its fairly user friendly and she is doing well with it.
1,Excellent device. Light weight and easy on eyes. Next time I'll get a black one instead of the white to minimize glare in sunlight.
1,the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time
1,"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice."
1,"The tablet is good for my son, he enjoys using it to play games."
0,I'm use to android so this was hard for me but I returned it and got something andriod
1,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. I was undecided between the Fire stick or the Fire TV and since a coworker has the Fire TV and loved it I went with the Fire TV as opposed to the stick - especially since there is more memory in the Fire TV (the TV is about 50.00 more but worth it)
1,I really enjoy reading books on this. Glare in the sun but great indoors.
1,Very good!
1,I had purchased the Fire stick before the box. It runs a lot smoother and lags far less than the stick.
0,Good for the price. Low memory but good descent graphics easy to use
1,Great tablet for the price! Perfect for my son !!!
1,"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it."
1,I love using this to stream movies instead of using my old PS3. Great picture quality and pretty fast.
1,This was an upgrade from old Kindle. Screen is great and love the size of the screen.
1,It is very easy and lightweight to carry around and use
1,Got this for 35$ thanksgiving day. Lighter than the original and actually faster than ipad air. The 32 micro sd only cost me 9$. There is no way ipad can beat this!!!
1,"Fathers day gift. Bought the Google home, could not connect to his wifi. I took it back and got this. What a pain to set up. It was the new router he bought not the Echo.He likes it so far."
1,I am so glad i got this tablet i can take it with me anywhere and use anytime
1,Great products. Haven't used the shoulder bag much. I don't travel much. Nice to have just in case.
1,I love my Echo! Bought a second one for a gift and a Dot for my upstairs.
1,The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
1,I purchased these as door prizes and they are always loved to those who win!
0,Works well but after memory builds it starts acting up. Shuts on and off randomly. But for the price it's ok.
1,Easy To Use · Long Battery Life · Quality Build · Quality Display
1,Great simple to use light weight and love that's its wireless
1,Well worth the money. Bye-bye cable company bills.
1,"Haven't used much or found out all that it is capable to do, but, so far it is fun. Will say more later after I try a few things."
1,This is the third time I have purchased this item for the tv's in my house. I completely love it
1,"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
0,"For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix). So be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage."
1,Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup
1,I love how clear and bright the display is. Also love how light it is.
1,Many features this tablet has and is a great price!
1,"Bought it for my wifes Yoga Training Course.So much cheaper than buying all the paperback books she needed, and she loves it!Cheaper books, music, emails.. What more do you need?"
1,"Very nice product, works seamlessly. Very easy to setup. easy to down load apps and has a faster processor. You can down load the movies/songs and other stuff if you connect the hard drive. Voice activated remote is an added benefit."
1,"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy."
1,I feel giving a kindle to kids is better than losing an iPad
1,"Initially I figured this would be just a fun toy, so I resisted buying one for a long time. I finally gave in and kept my receipt in the event I needed to return it. I absolutely love it and even purchased the Echo Dot. It is a great way to tie all your smart home products together and to simply ask for something to happen. There are plenty of YouTube videos of unique ways to use Alexa. I use Wink (not too happy with it), but with Alexa, those products work very well. The speaker is excellent when you pair it to your phone to listen to music. Alexa is not 100% perfect and she does not always understand what you are saying, but it is improving."
1,It has been a great streaming device. Its very reliable.
1,Well worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account. Easy set up....excellent streaming quality. My only complaint is that I wish the speech search feature (there is a speech recognition search feature) worked with other apps.
1,"The more I thought about using my phone to read ebooks, the less I wanted to read. But the Voyage has gotten me back into reading. Light. Holds charge for week at least. Only request is I wish it could do white letters on black at night."
1,The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.
1,I saw this item on Amazon if I had ordered it from them I would had to wait 30 days. Best Buy had it in stock for the same price. Having uses it for several weeks I found its a great small tablet for a great price. I plan to buy several more as stocking stuffer. For an entry level tablet you can't beat it.
1,"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against."
1,I think this is the best purchase I've made all year. Nothing better to say
1,i have been wanting a kindle for some time and am very happy with it
1,"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."
1,You always go back to the product brand that serves you well! Great price for the top rated quality!
1,"I purchased this instead of the fire stick to pair with my new 4K tv. Easy to use, huge selection, small sleek design blends in to my entertainment system."
1,The fire is good had to buy a extra memory card. The charger is shorter than it should be. My son likes it
1,I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.
1,"It is very easy to set up and use. It has great functions, but am waiting for more to be added to give 5 stars."
1,The tab is very good for the price what is being offered. Allows to have separate kid profile as well so that they don't have access to unwanted stuff. YouTube app can be installed as well.
1,I got it for my god son and he loves it .it's east use to
1,"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis."
1,For the price it has great sound and very good responses to tough questions.
1,this kindle was for my 3yr old so she would stop using mine. she really enjoys it and caught on really quickly to the updates compared to mine that was purchased 2 yrs prior.
1,My granddaughter love it works good she is on it all day.
1,This is excellent for toddlers and also as they grow. Numerous things they can do on it and also nice to be abke to control it as a parent.
1,"The kindle fire has all the things you need to read books, surf the net and play!"
1,"Works on wireless networks, awesome for streaming 1080p AND 4K content."
1,"What's not to like? This thing does it all. If you are a trivia buff, you will be occupied for hours, So much info in a small cylinder with a tiny footprint. It is unobtrusive, fits in with any decor. Keeps the grandkids busy for hours.What will they think up next? It's already been replaced by a similar unit with a screen. (the look). It performs as they say, with enough microphones that can hear across a loud room. The speakers are good, but don't expect to be blown away.My advice...find it on a big sale and enjoy."
1,Bought this to read out by the pool. Works great! Only thing that could make it better would be if you could adjust text size for imported PDFs.
1,Bought this for my 6 year old nephew and he loves it!
1,This is a very fun and useful devise. Very easy to setup! It has great sound. I was able to setup with the apps to turn on/off my TV along with my lights. I love how there are so many new apps. I can't wait to connect it to my Sonos speakers.I love it so much I purchase several of the Amazon Dot for my family members for Christmas gifts.
1,Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
1,I bought two for my kids for Christmas. They love it.
1,Would recommend - it does what it claims in the commercials
1,"Bought this for my mom. She mostly plays games on it, but loves it."
1,"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
1,The new paperwhite reaches the sweet point of price and specs. I'll not pay for the extra 80 bucks just for the page press.
1,"I bought the echo in white. I think it looks better than the black one. Also bought a dot for the bedroom. If you get this and an Insteon starter kit, you can use Alexa to control your plug in lamps. It works well and I recommend buying it."
1,The Fire TV is an awesome device. Great for Netflix and Hulu streaming.
1,Nice tablet for the price. I wish the colorful ones available in the store.
1,Bought this so my brother could watch his videos on something other than my phone.
1,"So far I've had my Fire Tablet for over a month. Its my first tablet. The lack of the Googlke Play store means the Amazon apps are pretty limited, but I found avway around that. The front camera is grainy but acceptance while using Skype. Battery doesn't last long, and it seems to take hours to recharge. For a $50 first tablet, I suppose those are acceptable flaws. Feels robust in the hand, though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight."
1,Works as described. I really like the ease of use when it comes to the interface.
1,"I've been considering the whole ""smart home"" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say ""table lamp"" instead of ""table light,"" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations. You have to judge the overall value for yourself, but if you're already considering the Echo and what it can do for you, I strongly recommend it."
0,"I returned and got the 8"" since this turned this product and would not turn on. I got another since it was a gift."
1,Got this as a gift for my sister. She was running out of book shelf space this was the great idea. She loved this gift and it has a light so you can read this one in the dark.
1,"We have a couple of these now for our kids. Create a kid account and allow access to a few apps, add a memory card for more storage for movie video files that you have and it's enough to entertain the kids on car trips or keep them from going nuts in restaurants occasionally."
1,"If you are looking for a decent tablet for a great price, look no further because this is the bee's knee's."
1,I bought this for my 2 yr old. (For his first experience with plane rides and airport waiting) it was very helpful in keeping him quiet and occupied. It can be a bit slow depending on your wifi connection but not problem enough for me to dislike it.
1,It is fun to tell Alexia to play Bruno Mars on Pandora
1,"I had my doubts about the utility of the echo but with amazons continuous updating of its skills, I've come to rely on it for a lot of things, even mundane tasks like my morning alarm clock. I just tell Alexa when to wake me up. Can't wait to purchase some more smart home appliances to integrate other stuff around the house."
1,"I love Alexa! She is so helpful to have in my everyday life, and so entertaining too. And I love her smart home connections; I can control my smart home with my voice through her. My only complaint is that you can't give her two commands at once, but it's easy enough to separate the commands."
1,"Easy to operate once you get the hang of it! Loooooove that it lights up so no reading light is needed. I love reading so I don't need the games, movies etc that the Fire has."
1,This product blows ROKU out of the water! I would definitely recommend this to my friends!
1,Text is very crisp and easy to read. Would recommend to others
1,We bought this for the grandkids to use for school homework and it wotks very well. Easy for them to use.
1,Great for my grandchildren when they come over and then I use it also good for all ages .
1,My nephews are always playing with my smartphone so I bought this for them and they are happy to have their own device to play with.
1,I had the fire stick before buying this and though I liked the fire stick i thought it could be faster. The fire tv definitely bumps up the performance a bit and having the voice search really helps a lot and makes it better.
1,Works well also great for reading recommend 4 star
1,The Amazon Fire TV is very reliable and worth the price if you are a serious streamer I recommend it highly!
1,I like that the reader has a backlight for reading at night
1,"I do not have a connected home, but the Echo is fun to use. More skills are added by Amazon each week. The accuracy of the Echo understanding my voice commands are excellent! Unfortunately, only the Dot can stream via Bluetooth. I would give the Dot a look when it begins to be generally available..."
1,I bought this because of its great price as a gift. It is a great tablet for someone entering the tablet experience. It has so many features just like the more expensive choices. Happy with purchase especially since we can add a memory card too . To
1,Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
1,"It's still confusing trying to figure out how to use Alexa and the app. To me, Alexa does not answer many questions at all or she does not understand many questions at all but I just need really be able to sit down and play around with the app. Is real funny though."
1,I bought this for my bedroom. I have it to control lighting and wake me up. Awesome.
1,"The tablet is almost perfect, needs to add more apps"
1,Amazon continues to improve Alexa. The product has unlimited potential.
1,It's really good for reading and for having a small tablet. To browse with.
1,"This isn't the best tablet, but for casual gaming, youtubing, the price was perfect for this tablet on black friday."
1,I took it on vacation in the Bahamas and Bald Head and read in the sun and in the pool.
1,I bought this product for my grandmother since she has a hard time reading the small print in books. The Kindle Paperwhite has a large font setting that has made reading much easier for her and the matte screen provides for minimized glare. She can now easily read a book again!
1,"For those on a budget, this tablet gets the job done. No buyer's remorse."
1,This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.
1,Good for someone who loves music. The speaker is loud and I enjoy using it.
1,"Good platform, easy to use although a keyboard might prove more helpful that having to ask Alexa."
1,"Not the most powerful tablet out there, but excellent for the price"
1,"Great product, would recommend it if you need a low budget tablet."
1,This was a gift for my daughter. It's easy to use and can do a lot
1,Great tablet for children and for entertainment...
1,"I purchased this tablet for my 2 year old and she loves it. She able to watch all her shows abd play games , its great..."
1,with the Alexa voice it saves a lot of time and worry
1,No surprises with this purchase - Works well and am pleased with it...
1,I love this tablet. Easy to use and has a lot of features.
1,"Setup went smoothly (vs. Roku that could never detect wifi), picture quality very good. Menus a little squirrelly and navigation/selection could be better, but not awful. Only negative so far is that remote seems to devour AAA batteries."
1,"We have 2 Echo's, one in the living room and the other upstairs. Alexa will not only play whatever music you ask her to, but she will tell you the weather, a joke, is a timer, an alarm clock, keeps a grocery list, will notify someone of your choosing of an emergency at home, is a companion for an elderly person, or even keep a paraplegic company just by using their voice. There are hundreds of Apps that you can download, that enables Alexa to do on your command. We use the Echo everyday and have listened to our favorite songs from our past as well as current hits and/or radio stations. She has become a welcome addition to our home. Buy one, you won't regret it."
1,This item is great! We have an apple TV for our other TV in our house but this item blows it out of the water. the ability to access so many additional things and apps is exactly what we needed. Plus being able to access the Amazon Prime music options and TV/Movie rentals makes it so we do not need to run to RedBox any longer.
1,"There's a lot of growing functionality with this product. I have a Philips Hue setup in my home, and it's nice to just ask for a certain lamp or set of lamps to turn on, off, dim or brighten. Saves me a trip to the lightswitch!The bluetooth speaker functionality seems spotty, as I have it connecting to my PC and it will arbitrarily disconnect, whereas other bluetooth speakers within about the same radius will connect and stay on.Aside from that, it's rather like having your phone handy and constantly listening to you, so you need not pull it out and ask for your appointments (or make them), and other things you might be used to doing with the Google Voice feature (or Siri)."
1,"The product is easy to understand and use. If you have already viewed a series from Plex, Hulu, or another provider, the remote will take you to where you left off. If you want to view something from Amazon Prime you press the button and speak the name and it finds it for you."
1,"It make take a little getting use to, but it is very helpful."
1,"This is great. It's pretty quick, it works, has USB connections for data, or for a mouse + keyboard, it's small, strong and neat. 4K is okay... but still not a ROKU 4 in terms of screen quality in my opinion. Although Fire is feels a little snappier, less noisy and heats less than the ROKU 4. I like it and will obviously keep it, but 4 stars just because there's room to improve it to be a nicer 4K streamer."
1,"Performance of the device is good, meets expectations."
1,The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls
1,doesn't allow for my apps but with memory card it will.
1,Was a nice deal for 50 bucks can't beat that and its fast and works great
1,I love the easy access to all of the apps especially the Netflix app.
1,"My grandkids love these, purchased 3 for the 6 - 7 year old. Per them ""the best gift I got"""
1,Works well for my children. They both have one and seems to run smoothly for the games and apps they use.
1,Easy to navigate with plenty of apps. Simple connection
1,"This tablet performs surprisingly well, especially considering it's just $50. The HD screen produces good images & great video. I own two iPad Minis, and I must say that while this is not quite as exotic as the Mini, the price makes it the better value hands down. One key feature is that it has a micro SD slot, which allows you to instantly increase storage capacity (up to 128GB, I believe). This makes it very capable of managing large amounts of photos & videos."
1,I got this tablet for my daughter and it does everything that's she needs it for. It runs all the apps she has downloaded and not much lag when opening the apps.
1,.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet
1,I found the Paper white Kindle so easy to get used to. I always preferred paper books and could never get used to reading on my iPad or iPad mini because of the weight of them. The Kindle is user friendly and light to hold. I love it!
1,I just need to learn about all the ways I can use this. But love it so far!
1,I bought this for my dad for Xmas and I ended it up using it more than him while on vacation and I loved it!
1,"A little nervous about buying this product online since I always buy in store products, but this was the best service I could ask for. I was able to follow my order at anytime . The order was received quickly and without any hassles."
1,"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
1,The size and how easy it is to navigate all the features is a super plus.
1,If you have a smart-home you're going to love this device. I have it integrated with my Hue and Nest products and it works flawlessly. Highly recommend for voice command to smart devices and easy ordering from Amazon.
1,"The Kindle voyage is an improvement on the paper white. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to use."
1,Works great! Still trying to figure it all out but I have no problems so far. I am looking forward to expanding my uses for it but so far it makes for a great speaker!
1,"Echo is fun to play with, but doesn't understand a lot of questions and the ""skills"" don't work if you don't use the correct wording. The app needs some work bc you have to look through all of the skills to find the right questions, you can't just search the skills that are enabled. I'm sure that it will get better with time, but for now, it's fun to have around."
1,It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.
1,We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching
1,Listens to my every word and isn't insulted when i tell her she is dumb as a stone!
1,I absolutely love my Echo.I greet her in the morning and she greets me back and sometimes has an occasion to talk about.I love that she plays music too.
1,I had an old Kindle and this product is a lot easier to hold. I like the feel of the screen when turning the pages it almost feels like real paper.
1,"WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME"
1,Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
1,Alexa is so much fun. Love the jokes and the ability to get any information I need by simply asking
1,good product***********************************************
1,I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for my son along with the amazon fire 7 case. The tablet has a neat kid free time feature that you can use to limit time spent on tablet and control web sites viewed. The features are great but a little time is needed to enable these features. Over all four stars/ 5 if it was easier to use and didn't have to much advertising on locked screen.
1,The Kindle is very great reader and recommendable for people.
1,Love this. Great for bed- time stories & timers for kids.
1,"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
1,Love fireTVs and Firesticks. They always work well.
1,"If you want a good e-reader Amazon has a number of options, but some of the newer ones are unexpectedly expensive. This one is great if you want to read any time but not break the bank."
1,This perfect for my mom who loves to listen to auto book's.
1,I chose this product over the fire stick because it's hardwired to my Internet box give great speed without buffering I would recommend this if your router or modem is nearby w I chose this product over the fire stick because is hardwired to my Internet box give great speed without buffering I would recommend this if your router or modem is nearby your unit.
1,"great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value."
1,The best gift for someone and you could download a lot of games
1,It has good sound and can pick up my voice in a normal speaking tone.
1,"I bought this for my sister after her child stepped on her laptop and broke the screen! She is in love with it - it's just the right size for her to do her photo editing, surf the web, watch videos, etc. It's quite durable as well - seeing as how a four-year-old has his hands on it quite often :)The only thing that could be improved is the camera quality - but we didn't buy it to take pictures with. Just to edit them!"
1,Who needs a laptop that takes up so much space? Go for this Amaon Fire that fits in your hands. It has capabilities for multiple accounts and time limits for children...or even your spouse. Worth the price and very convenient. No lap required.
1,Bought this for basic web browsing and low-requirement games. Serves purpose at a cheap price and has good quality and help support.
1,"Useful for weather, news and listening to music while in kitchen. We have used to control some lights. Great for grocery lists."
1,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
1,The amazon fire tv is great in all aspects and is so fast
1,The amazon kindle paperwhite is perfect for reading before bed and anywhere really. The paperwhite is lightweight and easy to use. The paperwhite allows me to read my saved books from the amazon kindle app from anywhere.
1,my 2 almost 3 year old son for Christmas it is great even for adults as well very sturdy and holds but to a wild 2 year old
1,I got this tablet for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it
1,This can be used in any conditions. Very user friendly.
1,Good fit / feel in your hand when using this device.
1,Easy to replace old Kindle. Like larger screen and light
1,Simple hook up to smart phone and Internet. Love this product and learning more uses for it every day.
1,"The first one had a lag with the remote as it would randomly stop working but once I replaced it, it worked just fine."
0,No longer takes charge from manufacture charger or any other type of charger. Product did not last very long since had 7 months.
0,The screen is Crack already with the kids proof case
0,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
1,"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous."
1,"BestBuy had this Echo for sale at half it's regular price. We bought one and are having all kinds of interesting fun. Imagine when your hands are full and you say ""Alexa, set timer"". Not to mention all the other requests that may come up. Use you imagination."
1,Perfect tablet for my niece. Don't have to worry about her getting into anything she's not suppose to. Also don't have to worry about her watching things that aren't appropriate for her age.
1,Once u get her updated and on track she is ok.you download the app and away she goes
1,"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
1,I have 2 of those and work great and fast is a Bluetooth.
1,"I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage. But the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. After purchasing this device, I immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. Which, sadly, is more than I've read in about two years. This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. I would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes. This little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. Plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library."
1,I like the tablet it has a slot for a memory card for extra storage. It is easy to use and inexpensive.
1,"Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary"
1,This Fire TV works great for playing some games and streaming content. It's a plus that it's 4K enabled. Haven't really been able to use the 4K so can't comment on that
1,"Difficult to get set up and logged in. This product was a gift to an elderly person and she had difficulty logging in. Had to go to Best Buy for assistance. Kept repeating log in was already being used. I have purchased 4 kindle fire tabletsas gifts and everyone seems to be enjoying them. Two were for kids, they enjoy downloading games."
1,I use it for audiobooks a lot of the time . It has a good clear sound. Very easy to download books from the library .The battery seems to last a reasonable amount of time.
1,A great price for an e-reader with a great battery life. Love the e-ink too.
1,Alexa easily understands and responds. Great tool to use make lists...I do not have to reach for a pen and paper!!
1,"We are trying to make a smart house and Alexa here is the best. Alexa turns on everything we ask her to as long as we do not speak too fast. She is great for telling news briefs, weather updates, sports facts and conversions. She even plays the amazon playlists. If I am in the other room, she can still hear me if I speak a bit louder. I love Alexa!"
0,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
1,"I've had my Echo for a few weeks now, and it is awesome. It's so easy to use the voice commands. There are also a lot of possible connections and add ons in the Alexa App. Great purchase."
1,"i HAD both an Echo and a Google Home. I ended up returning the Google Home and kept the Echo only. The list of skills is great and the big advantage. Also all of the CES 2017 announcements made it clear that the industry, at least at this point, loves the echo. I couldnt agree more!"
1,"I bought this after I bought my Firestick, and this is faster. Works great with Netflix, easy to install and load, picture quality is fantastic."
1,"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet."
1,"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price."
1,"I find this satisfies my desire for a book reader and small tablet at an excellent price ($39.95 - on special sale). It is a version of Android, and will take many but not all android apps. Actually, I haven't used many conventional android apps with it, and none of them has failed to work. I have been able to use Bluetooth accessories such as keyboard and powered external speaker. I would buy this again, and actually have. But the second time is as a gift."
1,Brought it for my mom and she loves it . It is easy to use and it works great!!
1,A steal for a tablet to surf the internet or control automation
1,"love my new echo, works well pros easy to install does not take to much room. The sound is crisp. My only grip is i paid 50.00 more then what the price was in xmas."
1,Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
1,My wife and I love our Kindles when cruising or out at the beach. They work great in sun and are compact and travel well.
1,This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad.
1,I love the adjustable font size and the front light which allows me to read in any lighting even without my glasses. Pagepress allows me to turn page effortlessly and i can close my book turning it off and when i resume reading I'm right back where i left off. Love it. Capacity is unbelievable.
1,Work good with my internet. Have basic cable and use this to watch movies and steam tv shows.
1,"solid product by amazon, for streaming with various services."
1,It's very convenient for readers and online use! It works quickly and is great
1,"I bought a few of these over the holiday for my niece, nephews and step daughter. They love it. I especially love the parental locks and restrictions that can be put in place. Helps to minimize what the children have access to."
1,Very useful. More better for reading than ipad. good for eyes
0,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
1,Customer service rep took my sale was horrible. Would not recommend her as a customer friendly person
1,"Awesome Video streamer, once rooted, unlocked and loaded the possibilities are truly unlimited."
1,it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
1,Imagine my 4 grandkids joy when they opened their gifts. Love love love them!
1,This is as much fun as I expected it to be. Love that I can play music and change songs hands free while cooking.
1,"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!"
1,Absolutely love Kindle Kids Edition. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids.
1,"The amazon echo works great. News, sports, weather, and so much more! Excellent purchase."
1,Bought just for fun during a special sale and we love it! Bought the Echo Dot too. Easy to set up and use. Love it for bedtime to get music or sounds to fall asleep. Timer is great and alarm feature is very helpful as a back up to my phone.
0,"Ok, but sometimes alexa begin speaking without being asked, and sometimes light spins around when asked alexa a question without any answer."
1,This has met all my expectations and they are continually adding features to Alexa without any updating or upgrading by me.
1,"Bought this as a 2nd tablet for my mom gor xmas. Its been well over 6 months, it is still going amazingly well!"
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is light and I love the backlight. It's great for basic reading
1,"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
1,Works great with sling tv to fill the gap in shows I watch
1,I love my new paperwhite. I can download books quickly and now read more books.
1,"With the backlight, I can read without turning the light. Also the paperwhite is really easy on the eye."
1,Sounds great. Picks up voice very well and responds quickly.
1,I really like this Kindle. It has more features than the Kindle Fire 6. And the processor is a little bit faster as well. It is great for reading for the price and it is very economical as well.
1,"Amazon has created a great, smooth, intuitive and responsive interface. It works and works well."
1,My son likes the tablet well enough. He really only watches videos and plays games on it.
1,"Good for price, could have bought android tablet but it was no name for the same price. So went with it and my 5 year old really likes it. Just be careful of putting your credit card in. My son charged a bunch of games before I caught it. I thought he was just downloading free apps."
1,My husband gave me one for Christmas and I love It!!!! My entire family uses it. My son is visually impaired so he has access to so much with alex!!!
1,My kids love them very good and they enjoy playing there game and music
1,"I enjoy being able to ask Alexa to play music, tell me the weather or give me the latest headlines on the news all while I'm walking around my house. Totally love it"
1,"Usually, a $50 tablet is some cheap knockoff/no name brand limited capability tablet. For an Amazon tablet, You can't beat the price. If you're an Amazon shopper/user, this'll be a great tablet for your kid, an elderly adult in your care &/or you. For $50 (or less if you catch it on sale), I'll take the ads"
1,"Very simple, very light and has all the basic features you will be looking for in a tablet but don't expect a fancy device"
1,I love the small size as it is very comfortable to hold... the look and feel is very much like an actual book!!
1,I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.
0,I have tried to get it work& still can't get it to work!!
1,"I found the Amazon Fire TV responds faster than the Amazon Fire Stick. Plus it has an ethernet port! On my setup, this helps out a lot since I have 8 Fire TVs running Plex. If all of those were on one WiFI AP it would probably kill the bandwidth. The Amazon Fire TV loads quickly and works as expected. The only thing I don't like is I wish I could customize the home screen so it would only show what I want it to."
1,"In terms of mid-tier streaming devices, (Apple TV, Roku, etc.), I think the Amazon Fire TV is by far the best. The interface is neat and well designed, and the product has the most recent technology to allow for fast streaming over lower-tier streaming devices like the Chromecast or Fire Stick. In addition, I think the Amazon streaming devices offer better features for Prime members than what other devices can offer."
1,"I got this for basic internet access, reading kindle books and watching Netflix. Works great. No problems. Now, if you want to download a ton of shows, extra memory will be needed."
1,Waiting to see what developes .So far so good. Hooked in now
1,"I love the fire tablet so much so that I have purchased about 9 for my son, nieces and nephews"
1,WORKS GREAT BUT NEEDS SOME WORK WITH UPDATES TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND GIVE MORE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
1,haven't opened it yet as i bought it for my grand baby for christmas!....i'm sure she'll love it!!!
1,This tablet performs very well. It is great for someone that does not need a sophisticated tablet. Great value for the price.
1,My son loves his kindle fire tablet. It is perfect
1,Just a great product and the price is very competable
1,Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
1,Led to more echo dots and significant home automation.
1,Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
1,I love this tablet and it's easy to use. I would buy another for sure!
1,It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.
1,Great for reading in bed or reading on the beach in the sun (with or without sunglasses).
1,Worth the extra bucks to buy the TV over stick and plug in your Ethernet cable.
1,I bought 2 for my kids for reading and they are slowly but gradually picking up how to use them. They thought I bought it to download games. I told them one game each and the rest books.
1,I was just looking for a tablet that wasn't expensive and had good quality graphics and I was please with my purchase.
1,This table working perfect. Ir has very good resolution
1,Paid 50 bucks for it and with that you can't complain. Great for a general use tablet
1,I couldn't pass this one up for the money. Buy them for your kids so they can stay occupied for hours and get fat.
1,The person who I gave this to is enjoying this gift
0,It's silly these aren't provided with the purchase of a Kindle. Super expensive.
1,"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
1,"This is a very good tablet for use with streaming. It does lack some apps like youtube however, since it isn't connected to the google play store. If you are an amazon prime member this is an extremely good buy since you can easily access all of your prime benefits right from the home screen."
1,"Not disappointed, if you want good screen for movies, this is it"
1,"Works for what my mom wanted it for. Some of the questions we ask Alexa she doesn't know, but I guess they will work on getting updated information."
1,"It washer, it vacuums and it dries the floor in one easy touch."
1,"Love the blue tooth remote, does freeze up from time to time"
1,It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
1,Product work great. Loaded Kodi to watch movies and have not had any trouble. Definitely recommend this for anyone who has decided to get rid of the cable/satellite.
1,As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.
1,I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
1,"The paper white is a terrific reader and, for all light conditions, is superior to the kindle fire we had previously. No glare, easy read, easy use, with adjustable type print. We recommend it highly."
1,"It's a nice upgrade from the 6"" screen. Size is just right for small kids hands. Reading kindle books is much easier."
1,"So having this device has been great, Amazon prime aside, (as you can watch all of the great stuff Amazon has to offer if you are a Prime member) this devices allows excellent DLNA media streaming, access to online media applications such as netflix and many music sites as well.On my Smart TV i've always had an issue with the Netflix application crashing or not being able to connect for reasons unknown, and I constantly had to reset the entire ""Smart TV"" to get it working again ""maybe"".Using Netflix via the Fire TV, has never been easier, it actually makes the picture seem even more crisp than the native netflix application on my 4K Ultra HD 3D TV, go figure. the app doesn't crash on me, and i don't even use the Netflix app on the dumb i mean smart tv i have, i go right to the fire tv.This is a must have device for all things media."
1,"Profound content provided by this TV box. Plus 3rd party apps, you can watch free tv and sports."
1,"outstanding time filler, weather traveling or just relaxing. SD card expandable to hold several movies. Oh, and hey, front and rear cameras. And all on the cheep."
1,"The kindle paper white is Lightweight, easy to use, works great outside, love reading at night with the built in lighted screen too! Love how you can adjust the size of the print so easily too!"
1,"Kind of slow,but with the price it's acceptable. I bought it for my son and he doesn't care for speed."
1,"Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory."
1,Great reader for elderly. Bought this for my mother. She loves it
1,"I did my research and purchased one of these for one purpose, to side load Kodi on it. I was told in the store by an Associate that Amazon had blocked this ability, but this was not true. I had no intention of Rooting the box and it was not needed. It side loaded so simply that anyone could do it, no PC needed. It has a faster processing speed and better picture quality then the Amazon Fire Stick..and this does 4K video. Amazing little media box that has tons of entertainment for a small price. If you have fast enough internet I would highly recommend picking one up!"
1,Got it for my wife but I keep it. Got to get her one now.lol
1,"Without costing a ton like the Apple TV, the Amazon Fire TV has everything a cord cutter could want."
1,What a great device. The paperwhite is much clearer to see than on an iphone or android. Easy on the eyes
1,First kindle. Only used a few things. It was easy to set up. Now to purchase another for my daughter and see how easy to link.
1,No issues with the product. I am a satisfied customer.
1,"Performance up to expectations, but battery life less than expected and advertised. Backlight functions well."
1,My 9 yr old daughter loves to play with it. Be careful children don't order prime.
1,Probably the best priced tablet on the market. Works well.
1,"No complaints. Works great, even in the bright sun and at night!"
1,I purchased 2 of this Amazon Tablet for my 2 kids - 4 & 3yrs old.They just can't keep there eyes off this they fondly call IPAD.My wife laugh every day when they tell her to recharge their IPAD.
1,Had troubles at first as I was using a dual modem/router. Once I bought a separate modem and router it worked great and the picture is even better than what I was getting with Xfinity!
1,Great addition for reading on the go and shopping online. Compact and good battery life
1,"I bought this originally for my wife because she is always reading and was interested in a Kindle, though wasn't sure she could ever part with physical books. She loves it! Now with the Family Library option available we can all share our favorite books. I'm looking to buy one for myself and my teenage daughter this week, actually. Oh, and my wife has given up on physical books after this ;) She likes the backlight when reading in bed at night and the fact that it lasts for at least a week on a single charge."
1,"Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its ""Hands-Free"" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)..."
1,"I have always wanted to get the best products for the money for my audio video experience. The Amazon Fire for 4K has not disappointed. It was exceptionally easy to set up and attach to the internet and my TV. The updates for the Fire are seemless and fast. The visual quality is what was expected. If you already own the Fire would I recommend the upgrade? Do not know, but wish there was some sort of buyback program and then the choice would be easier. I do like the gaming ability of the system but have yet to explore those options extensively."
1,I bought 6 of these for christmas for my nieces and nephews. Best gift for the price. they love them for the online and app games.
1,The Amazon Fire TV is great. It was easy to set up and start using. The menu is very user friendly and easy to navigate.
1,Wish I didn't have to sign on with a card but great product
1,"got this for the wife, her first tablet experience was horrible. She loves this and can't live with out it!!!"
1,excellent
1,"This is a great little tablet for the money and does nearly everything you would want to do with a tablet. I plan to use it for travel and leave my expensive iPad Air 2 home. I was impressed with the resolution when viewing photos and it works well for reading email and Internet surfing. It is also great to have adequate storage by adding a micro card to the unit. Probably the major drawback is the camera, which does not take a very good picture when compared to cell phones and other tablets. Again, for the money, it's a great value for a small tablet."
1,All my friends have a computer and I figured I would start with the tablet. I am very pleased with my choice.
1,Works great when connected directly to wifi router.
1,Got this for my 4K Sony. Works great. It's faster than the apps on the tv with more selection. Plus I really like the Alexa voice remote. You can just tell the remote what you want and it goes right to it. Searches all your apps!!
1,Purchased as gifts & have not heard of any defects
1,"My mom was perfectly happy with it, very user friendly for someone who is not really tech savvy."
1,Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.
0,Good for beginners. Wanted something simple and that's what I got
1,Seems to work great for my teenage son. He uses it to watch videos on it
1,I purchase the Echo Alexsa for my wife and nest temperature gauge. She absolutely loves it. From adjusting the house temp to asking her about the weather
1,"Purchased as a gift for tech-challenged loved one - setup and quick start very simple and straightforward. Ease of loading lots of free library books alone made it well worth the purchase. However, if you have reservations regarding outdoor glare, I'd recommend trying it out first-hand before buying."
1,I'm getting rid of my DirecTV subscription for this. I love it! I don't have to forward through commercials :)
1,"I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie."
1,"Good tablet wish I could download apps on it like on my phone such as bank info, n other app I use would b more beneficial for kids"
0,Responds quickly. Hears my command from quite a distance. If you buy into google schedule (monthly fee) it helps you keep track of appointments birthdays etc.
1,Bought to use with harmony hub to control tv and it does! Also very handy for things you used to have to look up on the internet - for example in the morning Alexa what is he weather forecast for today?
1,"For the price that I paid, 35 dollars, it is more than enough. the best is the front and rear camera."
1,I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.
1,"I dearly love my Alexa, She is able to give me the latest weather update. along with other very useful commands. Plus she can make me laugh on a regular basis."
1,Everyone in the family can enjoy asking Alexa questions. Where it doesn't know everything it does seem to get better. The skills available are fairly diverse and useful. This is a good place to start if you are interested in having a smart home. I bought the echo and the dot with the battery pack.
1,Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
1,"This ereader is honestly the best that I could have bought for my first one. Now, I don't actually read often but wanted to buy something to help me read what I do have within my kindle account. I was stuck between getting this and the original kindle. Thankfully, I got this. Mostly because of the textured screen and backlighting. The backlight is what did it for me. I read reviews about the original kindle being hard to read in the dark, and that's when I would be reading the most. If I had seen how hard it really as to read, it would have gone back immediately.The weight is a little heavy for constant reading but nothing to really complain about. The battery life could supposedly last 8 weeks. But, apparently I am a bookworm. I have to charge it every other day with max settings.One thing I am thrilled the most about is the easy of accessing a dictionary or encyclopedia, the notes, and the highlighting. It tells you when others have highlighted other sections of a book I am reading as well. Im not sure if this is in general a feature of the kindle products, but it is extremely useful.Overall , I think this is a great ereader for beginners and bookworms."
1,My husband bought me this for Christmas and I love it! Bigger than my phone but small enough for me to hold. I also bought a case for it that helps it to stand up.
1,I love the kindle.. Reading is so much easier especially traveling and at beach
1,The set up was complicated and I had to go to the Amazon web site to get it rightIt finally worked
1,The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.
1,So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
1,I got this on sale for 33 dollars and I expected something different because of the low price. I would pay a hundred for a replacement if this one ever breaks. Very good product.
1,Who could could pass up such a deal under $50.Full color H D viewing and easy to use. Read a book or watch TV or a movie. This is an all around fun piece of equipment.
1,The Fire TV works just like it is supposed to. I got it mostly to watch CBS all access and it worked so well I purchased a second one 1 week later for another TV.
1,"I was very surprised by the quality and speed of this tablet, since it was only $40! I would highly recommend. Good for kids too - don't spend the extra money for the kid version, just buy them this one."
1,Battery wouldnt hold a charge but was able to get it teplaced.
1,The only time I really have to read is late at night when I don't want to turn on the lights and wake everyone up. The back light and touch screen make this version of the kindle much better than the previous ones.
1,I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
1,"Love the back light, fast response to changing pages. The kindle voyage is lite."
1,It was on sale. Worth it for a first time tablet buyer for something inexpensive
0,Easy to setup but doesn't do everything without additional products. Better than google home.
1,"I have the older Kindle with keyboard. This one is lighter, touchscreen, and has the back light. It was worth the extra $ to buy this one with the backlight. My daughter doesn't need to worry about whether she has a book light with her when she reads on long trips. A+"
0,"This is a ok tablet, worth $50 is a little slow, but for the money it's ok"
1,Easy to use. Sometimes does not understand or have the information. Use regularly as a kitchen timer and for weather updates.
1,The built in backlight is fantastic. Let you get a slimmer case that's easier to carry around
1,"Works great IMO altho when I first got it home the remote didn't work and appeared corroded insidewe called the store and they said I had to call some parts store, which said they were out of remotesKind of a run around IMO I got the remote fixed myself Other than that the box works grest"
1,She says this was the best gift she ever received.
1,My fiance loves that she no longer has to go to abook store to purchase a book. she can now simply click download and read a book.
1,i have never used this product before found it to be very easy
1,"Bought one for my wife and my daughter who is in college. They both love them. easy to use, great screen and endless choices of material to read."
1,The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.
1,My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
1,"Great product, works as expected. Cool features, my kids love it."
1,"this is one of my wifes favorite things , plays games , reads books ,"
1,"I love having books at my finger tips, 24/7. In addition to accessibility, my kindle white increases my vocabulary by offering word wise."
1,I love to ask it to play my Pandora station while I cook!
1,This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance.
0,Easy to use.Easy to connect with cellphone and tablet to play YouTube. The product said it will upscale to 4k quality but the picture show on the TV is the same as regular product without 4K.
1,"This is an OK device, decent speaker for casual listening. The voice recognition is not good though. When you have to yell and repeat commands over and over it gets frustrating."
1,Quick to set up. Fully satisfied. I protest about you review min letters
1,"Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer."
0,I would say that it is not for kids is because my kids have been downloading game after game even with a 64 gig sd card the main operating system only allows about 2 gigs of games that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited
1,Great for my grandchildren to keep up on the reading during the summer months It's so easy for the parents to actually monitor whether they do or do not do the reading.
1,"Great item for someone who is home alone, most of the time. Talking to it is an helper in accomplishing complex tasks. Listening to it is pleasing in sitting still."
1,"I bought it for my daughters gift, she loves playing"
1,Its little improved than previous version. Good deal at this price.
0,"After reading how fast this unit was, I was highly disappointed. My Roku 3 leaves the Amazon Fire Tv in the dust. It takes forever to load up, then freezes several times while being used."
1,"This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's ""awesome"", which is high praise indeed."
1,What a cool gadget. Great to have by the pool and change music without getting out.
1,I recommend this item and it works great. Go for it.
1,Love these firesticks its a very good device love the selection of movies.
1,work great sounds good work fast Good 4k tv you can add more thing
1,I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
1,"I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle.

1,This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
1,Great device for someone who is not very technologically advanced. Easy to use and understand.
1,"I cringed at laying down paper to pick-up technology. However, it was the best thing I ever did. I have been very pleased with this reader."
1,This is so much better than roku. It's a must buy.
0,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.
1,This unit is great. It has everything that I need in it plus more. It's fast and responsive with great voice recognition. The UHD content is awesome.
1,"VERY parent friendly! Extremely thorough parental controls. We were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. Then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the Fire and gave it a try. It allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. Also, very easy set up and use!"
1,I highly recommend the Amazon Echo. The range of information and music are fun and help keep me up on current events.
1,"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars."
1,"great little tablet for price, great if have amazon prime"
1,"don't have a smart tv, so this fire tv is perfect for downloading Netflix, vudu, and any other apps. a must for tv watchers"
1,This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!
1,"For me, the Amazon Fire TV is an amazing way to hook up with my favorite Netflix and Amazon Prime shows or explore other streaming sources. So easy to use. No more ""hunt and peck"" input for searching for the show I want to watch. I simply push a button, say the name of my fav show and it comes up on the screen. I love it so much, I bought one for both of my TV's!"
1,We enjoy this product more than our roku device. It works great.
1,I enjoy this product . I own 2 in addition to the fire sticks in the kids room.
1,store sales person was very helpful. price is always the bottom line.
1,"The Amazon - Fire TV with Alexa Voice Remote is a great product. The setup is easy. I do advise you to set up an Amazon account prior to make the setup easy. I am an Amazon Prime Member, but it's not necessary to use the fireTV. I also purchased the fireTV stick for a 2nd bedroom. I will tell you though, the FireTV is worth the extra money. Not only is the FireTV still small, but it has 4k definition and you can use Ethernet and Wi-Fi. The biggest difference between this and the Fire Stick is that fireTv has expandable memory, excellent to add photos, apps, movies etc. The app store on the device also has games you can play on the fire tv and for an extra $40 you can get a remote that looks like an xbox controller."
1,"Love paperwhite version. Perfect to read at beach, at night ,on plane, etc..."
1,The backlighting is great and it's much easier to read and turn the pages from the original Kindle. Highly recommended.
1,"I don't use echo as much as I thought I would, or should I suppose but it's a nice accessory to have. I have some trouble with it responding to my voice correctly but overall it works well."
1,Facinating product. A genius of a marketing tool for Amazon. Having a great deal of fun using Alexa.
1,"I bought this tablet for a gift for my nephew. It was a bargain on black Friday. I have not heard any complaints from my nephew yet.The only thing I did not like was the setup, it took too long."
1,"Amazed that with the Kindle Fire my kids are able to play games, view movies and read"
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter or companion tablet for watching videos, reading, internet browsing, and the like. If you have Amazon Prime, then you better get this!"
1,"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
1,"I previously only had the dot until I got this one. This is so much better for listening to music, the weather report .. everything."
1,Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
0,"Traded in the Echo for Google Home after trying both. Did the training questions but still found it could only answer 6 of 10 questions. There were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult. Google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question. Can ask for driving times to destinations without an app, same for getting a cocktail recipe. Very dry responses where GH has personality. Try them both before deciding what is best for your needs."
1,"Great charger. Somewhat pricey however. If you attatch it to the cable that comes with the e-book reader, this allows you to plug it into a wall socket."
0,"navigation needs more work, no pointer feature sucks, definitely NOT a point-and-click systemes explore for web browsing is antiquated and needs replacedvoice alexa feature does NOT work inside apps to control the app, so careful what you say or needless purchases are madeno disable option for voice featurestill one of the cheapest ways to run kodi program direct to telly in HDMI tho.one can still load app for plex server for NAS playback via streaming, though it is extremely difficult to navigate the plex download page in es explore.its faster than old version, has Bluetooth 4.1 instead of 3.1, has a quad-core instead of dual-core processor, and doesn't seem to get hot after hours of play like old version did.But, If Amazon ever blocked third party apps like kodi and plex I would never buy an amazon product again tho.Not an amazon prime member and never will be, why pay for programming that I can get for free."
1,Nice product..Was difficult to figure out how to download books onto device. Could use better instructions. Once I figured it out it works really well.
1,We purchased Amazon Fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost 2 year old for a 10 hour drive to Florida. Works great and I love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection.
1,It was the perfect Christmas present. Made everyone smile
1,Have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time. Its an extra for us we keep it in the living room.
1,This is the latest kindle model and is just awesome. Highly recommended
0,It's ok. It does not have all the apps you might be looking for.
1,Good upgrade to the Firestick. Alexa search works well so you can quickly find titles.
1,Would definitely recommend very convenient and very quick and responsive
1,If is the easy to set up and use ...Got everything I wanted and more the speed of the tv box is great !!!
1,This thing has everything you need to watch movies and shows in 4K. I watch it almost everyday.
1,This is an ideal unit to use when cutting the cable from your provider. Very easy to install and there are great YouTube videos to get even more out of the unit.
1,"I got this tablet to replace my sons old one, I love the adult/child profile and the ability to have the 2 year replacement warranty. The case has also came in handy many times."
1,Bery good product for the price. Can't beat it. Id recommend buying this for a first time tablet.
1,"Daughter uses it constantly for games, texting, Web surfing, and email. Great alternative to more expensive devices."
1,Like the large screen for reading books and watching movies.
1,Great tablet starter for kids and also like that it comes in different colors
1,Bought for my wife and she loves it. Screen size is a huge plus. Easy to use I.
1,Overall this unit does everything it is advertised to do. It's hard to review something when it works exactly as described. I've had no issues.
1,You can keep watching your movie on the go if you have to leave the house.
1,"Took it on vacation & loved it! Read on the beach with no problems as the screen is bright & the font can be made as big as you need..Easy to download books too. If you're looking for just a great little, very portable reader I highly recommend this Kindle."
1,"Wish it could do more without subscribing to Amazion Prime. Bought this for my 19 year old daughter. She likes it a lot, but I think it could be improved by not tying it to a monthly subscription service."
1,My son loves his kindle! It was relatively inexpensive and he has dropped it multiple times and not a scratch!
1,"The Amazon Echo is very useful for all sorts of things, like playing music, telling the time, doing arithmatic calculations, etc. etc. Paired with a smart plug, you can tell it to turn lights on or off (for example.) All this is great fun and the Echo is adding new ""skills"" to its capabilities every day. The Echo has a decent speaker for music. Highly recommended!"
1,My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.
1,I purchased this kindle for my daughter inlaw for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!
1,Love it! Really like the camera as my old one was backwards and hard to use.
1,I'm pleased with the Amazon Fire. It puts web browsing and a reader in a device that will fit in my purse. As a Black Friday special the price was almost 'too good to be true'.
1,We brought this as a replacement for the fifteen to fifty books my daughter wanted to take with her to Hawaii. Books of course would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloths. Pesky airline and their poundage issues. Now she can take a hundred books and she has a mini computer. It's a win win but no win for the airlines!
1,"Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
1,"With a high functioning WIFI and an Amazon Prime Account you have all of the personal functionality of a Pad of I. My kids use them, bang the heck out of them and they keep on ticking. They have destroyed 3 Ipads, so for a kid at home, it is very nice. -Borat"
1,Pleased with my purchase.
1,this is my third or fourth one liked it so much got one for each of my grandchildren easy to use small enough for mom to carry in her purse or tuck away in the back seat pocket of the car and very durable
1,You will be amazed by the sound that comes out of this device. So easy to use and the voice activation allows me to change the station even from a distance. We plan on buying another one because our grown son has enjoyed ours so much .
1,"I bought one for myself and really liked it.Bought this one for wife, so far shes pleased.perfect size for purse and portability."
1,"This is a great little tablet. The price is right, and it offers a clear picture, with good speed for browsing the web. The interface with Amazon is perfect. Great for kids and adults too. Plenty of fun colors to choose from."
1,"Great apps!, Works great playing amazon movies! Very happy!"
1,Works well. Like that Android apps can be sideloaded onto the device. Easy to set-up and use.
1,Better than anticipated. Would recommend. Can't wait for q battery operated version.
1,Love the ease of Alexa. Easy setu and has great sound.
1,Not the greatest small tablet and Amazon does have it locked down pretty well but it functions.
0,You get wath you paid not comparable to a apple tablet never
1,Received this as a gift and is very useful. Battery power stays for atleast a week. Does not strain my ryes.
1,Purchased as a gift for my son...He LOVES it!I may need to get one for myself.
1,"Gave the family the Echo for Christmas and we are still learning how it can be used. So far it is a hands free Siri, not a bad thing, that can be used by the whole family. It is an easy and fun way for us to learn about the IOT."
1,Some channels still glitchy but overall great hardware.
1,love this tablet! has a lot of apps for free and great hd screen
1,"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
1,"Got this included in a package deal with our Harmony Elite a few months back, and it has served as a decent add-on accessory throughout our home. We mainly use it as a bluetooth speaker for our mobile devices since the Amazon Prime Music library is pretty sparse, and Alexa isn't nearly as advanced as Siri in terms of answering questions. However, I was able to create a rule using Amazon's API that allowed me to link Google search. Alexa is also inconsistent with performing smart home tasks, but I'm sure this will improve over time. I wouldn't pay full price for this device, but I would recommend if you can find it on sale."
1,"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows"
1,great tablet for the size. will be giving this to the kids from santa this year.
1,Grandchild loves the tablet. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly
1,"It is a lot of fun and my grandkids have a ball with it . Even my 3 yrs old can talk to it , he has fun asking for songs."
1,Works great and fast. Just the right size for my work needs. Great Apps available.
1,We both got one and we enjoy it very much!! We both can read our books and play games it's great for traveling too. Have no complaints here.
1,Delivers on all counts. Lets me read anywhere I want and download easily from my local library digitally!
1,"Enjoyed this tablet. Easy to use, light weight to hold and good size carry in your purse"
1,Love this kindle reader it is super easy to use and it has a long battery life!
1,It's a really good tablet for kids my kids love them
1,Purchased for my son works great and great price..
1,"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip."
1,Love the paperwhite! no glare- easy to hold. The built in light is also great for night reading. I had the Kindle app on my Galaxy tablet but never used it because of the glare.
1,My kids loved it. They use it daily. I would recommend to any parent.
1,"When I picked up this product, I ordered 2 additional for Christmas. They sent me to the MOA store and said they are in stock. I received the text from Best Buy stating that they have been picked for me. Once I arrived they had one, but stated the other one had been sold. I asked if they could get another from another location and they simply stated that it was a popular item for Christmas and they are probably out of stock. After asking four times, I picked up the phone and called Duluth since the website stated that they had some. The store manager looked at me and decided I was serious about checking another store. I spoke with a rep in Duluth and he state that he just got off the phone with the manager of the MOA location and he was shipping one to MOA. So, I hung up the phone, about 5 minutes later the manager came back out to talk to me and he stated they didn't have anymore. I mentioned that I spoke with someone there and he spoke with the manager at MOA and was shipping it to him. The manager denied that he spoke with him. I requested someone from Best Buy leadership contact me and still have not heard from anyone at best Buy. The manager I dealt with at the MOA was Link."
1,"My wife gave this to me for Christmas and one for my daughter. For the money, I thought it wouldn't be worth it, but I was wrong. It is really way more powerful than I thought. I can do Word and Excel, PowerPoint, pdf's, work email, surf the Internet, movies, books, games...pretty much everything I thought I needed to spend 10X the money to get. I'm very surprised and happy with it. Only two I would change: a better picture and stop the ads on waking. This is a great value."
0,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
1,Fantastic price. Large amount of app to choose from. Good parental controls. Helpful technical support. Of course don't expect this tablet to not getting slow when multiple apps are running in the background.
0,This is my 3rd kindle and my last-i'm moving on to something better!For me -following all packaging insert guidelines-they only lasted a year at the most.
1,"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
1,Love this kindle excellent price I just carry it everywhere. Fits perfectly in my purse.
1,Fascinating device. Voice recognition is best yet. No irritating wise guy responses like Siri. Integrates spectacularly with Spotify Premium. Can't wait to get my back ordered Echo Dot for my sound system.
1,"I use this device to watch Playstation Vue and SlingTv, amazing device, it streams SlingTv more smoothly than my xbox one, also the quality of video hardly ever drops, if it does its my internet and not the device. Great for the price, 100% recommended."
1,got this for my mom and she loves it good for games or reading on
1,"I love being able to say ""Hey Alexa, play the Beatles"" and she plays a mix of my favorite songs. And not to mention playing Jeopardy every night!"
1,very user friendly. my daughter has no problem navigating around to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime
1,Alexa is a blast. Had to go with it rather than google
1,"This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety."
1,The fact that it has parental control so I can verify what they are downloading is great
1,Better than Fire Stick. Great quality picture. Clarity with ultra hd.
1,I strongly recommend this item a lot of things to do
1,"This tablet is a great gift, specially if you have lil ones. They will be entertained for hours."
1,this is a very good product and is the better in the market thanks
1,Luv watching movies on the Amazon prime box.great price
1,Got this tablet for my daughter and she loved it again great tablet.
1,good sound quality and understand what you are asking without repeating yourself
1,Thinking that this would be just another gadget proved to be way off. The Amazon Echo has far exceeded our expectations! The sound is stellar and the timing is spot on!
1,"This is a great product, great for teenagers to read and play."
1,"Bought 5, 1 for each of my kids. So far so good. No issues with anything."
1,Works great. Less buffering than Fire TV Stick. Like the voice search on it.
1,Very fast and no problems loading apps onto the screen. Great price
1,"Upgraded from an older model AppleTV to this, couldnt be happier with the amount of features and apps available. Voice search is surprisingly great!"
1,"Got two, one for each of my grand daughters. They love the portability and it allows them to both be up at the same time."
1,Bought this for my mom during Black Friday. The screen is big enough for her to watch her movies and play her games. She thinks it's so easy to use. She was using a little cracked screen phone before so she treasures this.
1,Purchased this for voice command capabilities which work great. Great product.
1,Amazon Kindle is a great product - I bought one as a gift for my nephew and he absolutely loves it.
1,The fridge started to work earlier than indicated in the brochure
1,The Amazon Fire TV is simply awesome. I use it for HULU AND NETFLIX
1,"Bought this tablet for kids. Great price for what you get. Not as nice as the 7"" HD but price is right. Quick and responsive, would recommend for anyone looking for a tablet for child use. Parent controls are a nice touch."
1,This Kindle is so easy to use and the screen is very easy on the eyes!
1,"This product is the greatest thing.. Not only is it a speaker, but it is also a little computer at the palm of your hands. You can do so much with the Echo that we are having so much fun talking to her. There are little games you can play with her and she also has a variety of other things she can do. If you are on the fence about getting an Echo I wouldn't hesitate and run to the closest Best Buy and pick it up now. You will not regret it."
0,I already had an iPad and just bought this to see what all the fuss was about. Haven't used it hardly ever.
1,Lots of fun and educational- you can learn a lot and save the walking by talking to this device
1,This is good for the price battery is good quality of picture is ok
0,Its good for the price. Amazon store is not as huge as Android play store
1,"You aren't going to find a better tablet for this price. Loading non-amazon apps can be a pain and the OS is not the best, but it's great for games and reading."
1,The lighting makes this kindle the best I 've seen.
1,Pros: Look no further if you are a book lover and shopping for a ereader. The price is slightly on the higher side but well worth it. You might want to consider the upgraded Kindle Paperwhite with 300ppi if price is a concern.Cons: The Bookerly font update is not available yet although it is available in the Paperwhite.
1,Keyboard is a must for ease of use. Sometimes apps don't want to close.
1,I had a lot of eye strain issues when trying to read off of my i-pad and I just couldn't get comfortable while reading a book in bed. This purchased changed everything. I am now going through 4-5 books a month and I am doing so cheaply.
1,Easy to use! Reading clarity and background light/color is perfect. Lot's of free books to download and lot's of categories to choose from. You can also sample books that you would like to purchase..
1,Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
1,Very simple to set up and easy to use! If you are looking to start or add to your smart home this is the way to go!
1,I am happy with this streaming device. Easy to access and provide all the app that I am looking for.
1,good quality product will buy again best buy always has what i need
1,"Is there any better e-reader on the market? Not when you consider the overall quality and low price. This model has the same razor sharp resolution as the Voyage but with longer battery life. If you want a backlit e-reader, this is the one to buy."
0,We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.
1,"Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen."
1,We already saved money purchasing this and getting rid of direct tv monthly charges
1,My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
1,I bought this to add voice control to my Smart Things lights and other devices. It was easy to integrate and works very well. Also purchased an Echo Dot for coverage in a second room.Only slightly disappointed that the assistant is not as smart as the Google app on my phone. Still pretty good though.
1,"Just does what it is supposed to do, Put together well and should hold up for years."
1,"Great price, used for my 6 year old daughter on a 12hr drive from texas. kept her busy. used mostly for games."
1,The amazon Fire tv is the best of all streaming devices a must have for Netflix
1,Simply great and easy to set up!!! I would recommend this to anybody.
1,This radio was bought at and then installed at Best Buy. They did an awesome job and it works great.
1,Love this Kindle. It's a great value for the price.
1,"Great value, does everything you want it to do. I would recommend to those who want a simple tablet experience."
1,"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
1,This device has a lot of good features. Once you pay for Amazon prime your able too watch a multitude of movies.
0,"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for."
1,Good if you like movies and have prime membership.
1,My special needs son frequently drops his tablet. This is a great low cost option when no protection case can hold him back.
1,"This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!."
1,"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use."
1,This is a wonderful tablet for the price. I do a lot with Kindle based books and the size is great for reading. That it has the ability to take a 128GB Micro SD card really makes this a steal for the price.
1,Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop.
1,"This is a great product. I downloaded tv apps like directv, HBO go, tnt, ESPN, etc. then I take it where ever I go, as long as I can get wifi, I won't miss a show or a movie. Fire stick is a little more travel friendly but this is faster between clicking on screens and had more internal memory (with option to add sdhc card)"
1,like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.
1,Bought this item for my nephew. Loves it. Recommend buying the rubber case also
1,The set up was easy and fast. Just plug and play. You even get one month of free service.
0,"I haven't really used mine that much, therefore I cannot rate it to its fullest. So far its been good."
1,"Easy to use, the only problem appears to be with the remote control. Seems like it stops working at least once a week."
1,Terrific purchase that was enabled with an Amazon Prime membership. We just love watching TV shows and movies in the privacy of our home using the Amazon Fire TV device. Simple to setup...less than 5 minutes and we were on our way.
1,I didnt realize how much i would actually use this thing. she does everything. my 10 year old uses it for school. i use it for everything else.
0,"I have two Google home devices. They seem to be lacking in smart5 home controls. Now I find out that additional devices are necessary to use Echo in a smarthome configuration. Although currently somewhat limited, I expect that Google home will surpass the Echo with addon smarthome devices. I'll wait, rather then buy these devices twice."
1,It's great to read in any kind of light. There is a tiny bit of bleeding at the top edge but nothing noticeable unless you are actively looking for inperfections. Makes reading easy and accessible in a light for factor.
1,"I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker to use to play Amazon Music, and this product allows to to listen to music and do so much more. If you have an Amazon Prime account you'll enjoy this product."
1,Best buy had the best deal on this item. The echo is great and does that you can imagine.
1,We love this thing! And for only $50! It works perfect for quick netflix
1,Bought this mainly for my grandkids to play. The time limits you can set is great because they don't argue about who's on the most.
1,Love mine so far for reading. Good price and super easy to use.
1,I purchased this as a replacement for an original Kindle. It's a great reader that works everywhere.
1,"I do not use anything other than Exodus, so I see no difference between this and the firestick."
1,This version makes it incredibly easy to read. Much better than an iPad.
1,Great for reading on the go. Kid friendly. Easy to use.
1,"I don't have a smart home, but it does so much more than that! I got mine strictly for my own entertainment! I have not been disappointed! My daughter has a smart home and I got to see what it did for her. While controlling her lights and thermostat is nice, I am happy with playing my favorite songs. It will give me the forecast as I lie in bed! It sang me happy birthday!!!! I am still finding all of the neat things it can do!!!"
1,Have had nothing but an amazing experience with it
1,My fire stick is one of the best electric devices I have ever bought.
1,"Great to search songs, check out news n weather. Ask information about a subject you are searching. Grandkids are forever playing with it!"
1,Easy to set up. So far I like it. I added CBS All Acess to it and work great.
0,Bought for lil brother its a ok tablet for a kid especially apps like WWE and cartoon
1,I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.
1,"Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera"
1,Making a gift baskey and choose to place this Kindle Fire as the main surprise. Great price!
1,Finally an affordable name brand tablet with all the bells and whistles. Amazon has outdone it's self with this little gem.
1,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
1,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
1,"Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing."
1,"This is great for family use. For the price it was great. I can leave it out,and the children LOVE it. The TV is very lonely now."
1,"Easy to use, purchased it for a child! Great tablet for kids!"
1,It's easier to read my books and stuff on this than my phone. Also had a micro SD card lying around to expand the storage.
1,"Really love the Echo. Have not learned how to use all the features, but really enjoy the ease of getting the music to play."
1,We got this for our 6 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.
1,Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.
1,"The Amazon tv works great! Fast loading, and no buffering. Works awesome with the Kodi app!"
1,Great gift great price light weight battery lasts long time
1,"The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. Anything and everything you could imagine at your fingertips to watch. If you are on the fence about the purchase , I highly recommend this to anyone. It's a great item."
1,"We searched for months, wanting to cut our cable bill. Bought the Amazon Fire TV box. Amazon has their own programming and is adding more all the time. Also, downloaded a bunch of apps, and have been watching TED talks non-stop. Also bought an HD antenna for local channels, of which we get about 45. Deprogrammed the foreign language, shopping, preachers, and still left with about 35 which offer the 5 main broadcasters, and a LOT of 50s-70s repeats."
0,"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services."
1,"I bought this so that I could read in the bedroom without waking my infant, and without bright lights shining right in my eyes. I'm so glad I bought it! And the battery life is amazing!"
1,"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
1,"This is my second Echo. If you are NOT into home automation, the speaker is worth the price just as a speaker. However, if you have an amazon Prime membership, the Echo really shines with access to prime music and other Amazon services. It is also a good way to start into home automation. I personally have the wink Hub and Relays; Alexa (Echo´s Siri) integrates perfectly with Wink and IFTTT. I am placing Echos in rooms where I want Wireless music and the dots in the rest of the rooms to control my Smart devices from anywhere in the house."
1,Great tablet for the price. If you have Amazon prime it's even better
1,Very good product. Works well with all televisions.
1,I was tired of my cable bill being so high so I got the amazon Fire TV + Digital antenna. This is a great alternative to Cable TV.
1,Can't say enough good things about this product. Very happy with the way that Alexa integrates into my life. Well designed and well executed. I'm waiting for Amazon Dot's to put around my home.
1,This gives me so many app and avenues to watch and stream directly.
1,"I purchased the echo for 179.00, it is no on sale for 139.00. My friend bought one at home depot and they gave $40.00 refund. I had mine for 3 weeks but Best Buy would not give me a refund. Alexia is working great. I am going to buy me the smaller echo. At Bed Bath And beyond I get 20% 0ff. At home depot I get 10% off."
1,I really like not having the bump on the bottom like the previous Kindle reader like the previous Kindle readerI dislike the fact that the screen is not recessed like the previous Kindle reader so that you cannot set the unit down facedown
1,Easy to read. Great for travel. Has been an excellent purchase.
1,Still needs more compatability for things it controls. Needs some sort of access to maps
1,My previous kindle's home page was more intuitive than the Paperwhite I just bought
1,"I like this tablet a lot. I now own 3 of them and feel good that I can have one close to the tv. If I step on it and crush it I am only out a few bucks. It is clearly not as nice as my ipad, but I can get 10 of these for what one I device costs. I use it to watch tv, read, and surf the web. As a sports fan, sometimes I line all three up so I can watch three games at once."
1,I love the Echo Alexa is great the features make life easier especially with all the compalibility options there are
1,Really enjoying our Echo; listening to music and using for alarm and reminders
1,"Amazing fire TV is simple, works seamlessly. I like the streaming speed, and cache on the device. Amazon has lot choices interms of movie. Big bang for your buck."
1,I like the tablet. It is pretty awesome. Easy to use and you can download lots of free games that you couldn't download for free on other devices and underground Amazon is the reason why.
1,this product was amazingly fast n has made my smart tv even better
1,I started out looking for an iPhone 7 Plus. My company wanted my iPhone 7 and $400. I looked into tablets and found this wonderfully sized Kindle. It does everything a phone or a tablet does for a fraction of the money. I love mine.
1,Alexa is ready quickly and very easy to use. Accurate information and good sound quality
1,Sales guy didn't have much knowledge about the Kindle. He wasn't very helpful in getting me started.
1,She loves it and it's easy for her to use. Perfect for the younger child growing into adulthood.
1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON TO USE TO WATCH VIDEOS & PLAY GAMES. I HAVEN'T BEEN DISSAPOINTED AT ALL SO FAR. MONEY WELL SPENT.
1,"I bought the Amazon Fire TV about a month ago. I reviewed the Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast. This one was rated the highest and i haven't been disappointed. I also have the Apple TV. It was more and difficult to operate for my wife."
1,Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
1,Great product. Great value. Worth every penny. Ads do not interrupt reading or alter the experience significantly.
0,"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!"
1,Fathers day present. Really enjoy Alexa. Works great and comes in handy by the kitchen.
1,we love this fire box.It gets all of the channels and even new movies that are still in the theater
1,"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it."
1,Does everything we expected! Great for the price. Had it over a month now and no problems. I'd recommend it!
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great way to be entertained and stay well informed! Thanks to technology you can ask Alexa, questions and because it's a blue tooth speaker you can play your music in a stylish way!"
1,"I bought this as a Birthday gift for my son. He saw videos about it and fell in love with it. Once we plugged the Echo in, it was an instant hit in the home! Setup is simple and Alex is ready to assist in moments. Amazon hit the nail on the head with this one."
1,My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!
1,"I am really happy with my Echo. So far it has been very easy to use, although we havent completely figured out all the functions. It was fairly easy to set up."
1,Easy set up. Very easy to use. Was easy to install.
1,"Bought one of these to get something to try out Kodi, as a streaming media device it works really well. I love the fact you can have your Netflix and other apps right at hand, I can still run plex and Kodi installs In a matter of minutes. Nice to have a single device to run all my needs and totally replaced the need for cable. The sticks work well but the extra grunt of this is worth the additional spend."
1,There are no words except greatest thing created! We use this thing every single day! We watch old and new movies and tv shows!
1,"Great for playing music, asking questions, and playing around. You will discover new uses for it every week."
1,"the Kindle Voyage is the very best ereader that I've ever used. The light is great and does bother my eyes in the the dark at all (iPads, Fire and Nook tablets bother me in dim light and extended reading) while providing light read by. The controls are simple and easy to learn. However it is slightly pricey. For me the quality and relief are well worth the price."
1,Bought 2 for our grand kids Great price and very good graphics
1,"Decent price for a nice tablet. Got it for Kids, I set it up and got ready to go, kids love it and spend time playing their fave apps."
1,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my wife. I have always loved the Kindle products. This is her first Paperwhite and we are incredibly pleased with it. Very lightweight, the touchscreen aspect doesn't get in the way of things, and the backlight doesn't compromise the e-ink quality of feeling like reading on paper."
1,Our kids ranging from 4-12 like this product. It's very versatile for all ages
1,"This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra."
1,It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
1,It great daughter loves it! She loves how fast it is
1,"I used a couple of the brands that are just priced under this product and well...you get what you pay for! This tablet was much easier for my granddaughter to learn on. She can access her camera, pictures, videos, and games, much better than the ""other brand""."
1,This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
1,Kindle paperwhite reader is great. Easy way to buy books.
1,I love this device. I love learning all the stuff it can do and I look forward learning what Amazon is going to do to improve it in the future.
0,This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.
1,I use my Echo everyday! When I want to listen to music or just one song it will play it. I use it for the kitchen a lot! When I want a kitchen timer it works perfect. We will get a group and play games with the Echo also. It is a great overall addition to a home.
1,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The Echo is an excellent product and gives out excellent clear loud sound. This was a great buy! You can ask Alexa to do anything from songs to buy on Amazon etc. thanks best buy for all your help!
1,"Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough."
1,This ia a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for entertainment.
1,Bought the new for Father's Day. Works well sometimes have to reset it to connect to Internet. All the apps are easy to access.
1,Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
1,"works as described, but still needs some improvements such as more languages, more convenient menu... overall, it is one of the best TV boxes in the market now."
1,I bought this for my room but my teenagers wint let me use it. They live. I'm thinking about getting another for myself
1,This product does more than I thought. Outstanding.
1,"Tried Voyage and Paperwhite. I like Paperwhite, why to spend more."
1,"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
1,Great product a like a lot .works perfect in any tv
1,Good for searching the web & email. Good game apps. A bit disappointed that I don't have access to apps thru google & some videos will not play.
1,Got it as a Christmas present. Recipient enjoys It very much.
1,This box was definitely worth the upgrade than the stick. It's snappier and easy to install programs on.
1,"I decided to cut the cable and bought Amazon fire tv. That along with a high definition antenna is all I need. So easy to set up and use. Tons of apps to choose from and I love Alexi. I simply tell her what show I want, she searches through all the apps and shows me where it is. How simple is that? Love it."
1,"This thing is awesome. It plays my music, turns on my lights and cools my home all by way of my cell phone. I couldn't ask for more."
1,My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
1,Purchased for grandchildren and they love it. They are five years old.
1,Absolutely amazing. A must have for the home and Ethernet connection makes internet connection fast and reliable
1,My son loves it! This is his 1st tablet. He uses this for his reading assignments and research too.
1,We have 2 fire sticks and 1 fire TV. This is a great into. Love the voice search remote. NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS APPLE ITUNES.You will not be able to stream Vudu and Apple on this device. Recommended. We are Amazon Prime which I also highly recommend to maximize value for this product.
1,"We switched from roku 3 to Amazon Fire. It has take some getting use too, but we like it. Several friends recommended it and I would recommend it."
1,Purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle. She loves it. Great product.
1,I think this is one of the better streaming devices
1,I have 2 FireTV boxes and 2 Fire Sticks and love them both. The sticks buffer a bit sometimes but the box never does for us. I use it with Playstation Vue and it works great!
1,Unreal black Friday deal on a great product. Wish there were more like it.
1,Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do.
1,"I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product."
1,This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass)
1,"Good battery life, Good screen clarity, Easy to use."
1,"Its a good product within this price range. Though the processing is not very fast but its ok for this price. For me, i bought it for my 2.5 year old son who just want to view video's and try out some basic stuff. So good to start for a beginner."
1,This is our second Amazon Fire TV. They are great and we've never had any issues with it. We really love the Amazon Prime membership as well.
1,"Excellent price, good quality, you can't ask more for so little money."

1,It's a really good thing to have a round the house
1,Love this TV box does everything and even more. Everyone needs one.

1,This is a great little tablet for what you're paying for it! Gets everything done that I need it to
1,"I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."

1,Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.
1,Is easy and nice tablet. I love it... I can share my account with my husband.
1,Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.
1,Love my new reader. It took a while to sort out all of the functions as it is quite different from my old Kindle. Now however it goes with me everywhere. I especially like the back light that makes reading always easy.
0,My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
1,Love this device!! Easy to set up and fun to use. Highly recommend.
1,Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes

1,I got this for my wife. With a little help from our daughter we got it set up. So far so good.
1,Sales people were helpful controller cable should be longer
1,My wife and I love the Amazon Echo. It is very easy to use.

1,"Can't beat kindle fire, already have 2 and got 2 more Thanksgiving sale for $33!!!"

1,This is a great tablet for the price. It comes with amazon app store and has plenty of apps and selections. Don't miss this deal!
1,"Fast,reliable, and has everything you need!!! Use Kodi for free everything you'll want to get rid of cable/satellite ASAP"
0,After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.
1,Is this the best Wi-fi speaker in this price range? No. Is it the coolest? Absolutely. The echo is easily one of the most unique gadgets I have in my house right now. It's pretty cool as a stand alone speaker but way cooler considering the smart capabilities of this device. My favorite part about the echo is that as time goes on it gets better not worse thanks to new skills being developed on a regular basis. The only complaint I would have with this speaker is that at high volumes the low end gets very distorted.
1,I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
1,This is a great product. It works great and is fun to use.
1,First got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition.
1,"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
1,The the price and size it works well my mother loves it
1,Bought this to view movies and shows online - worked out pretty good so far!
1,Read a lot about my product and would only purchase at Best Buy
1,"This is a great tablet, if you keep your expectations in check. Is it going to rival the likes of the iPad or even the 2013 Nexus 7? No. But there is a lot of junk in the $50-100 tablet market. Thankfully the new Kindle Fire isn't one of these. The screen quality is adequate for reading and watching youtube, netflix, and hulu. I had multiple apps open and it didn't feel too bogged down. If you can find it when it is on sale for $39.99, it's an even bigger steal."
1,good add thirt party app watch chinese tv.speed fast .and stady.
1,MY KIDS BOUGHT THIS FOR ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
1,Great little tablet I gave as a gift to my mom. She is not tech savvy at all and she seems to have no real issues using it.
1,"Bought these for Christmas, and it was the hit of the gifts! The kids and adults loved them. The adults appreciated the ability to monitor the fires, liked to use them also."
1,"I now have 3 Bedroom,kitchen and shower area and I will be getting one for the media room in the future. I think that says it all. The only down side is since it's operations is in the cloud, if Amazons servers go down then it's a brick but you can connect to Bluetooth on the phone and also use it as a Bluetooth speaker. There is one thing they could fix and that is when the volume is up high then if you try to talk to the Echo, it can't hear you and you'll have to manually turn it down."
1,Very affordable and very easy to set up. It has great features. Makes you use your phone lesser.
1,I am in love with the tablet. It is a perfect tablet for me to use at home and on the road for basic internet tasks. I am able to download apps and also use it as a reader. I love it!
1,His amazon echo is a must for a smart home Apliance.
1,Easy to set up and works great right out of the boa
1,"Love Fire TV. I have since cut cable, with the exception of my internet connection, and have no regrets. I get more channels through streaming media apps. and at cheaper prices.

1,Works as advertised. Will be interesting to see that additional apps that Amazon rolls out for the Fire device.
1,"Easy setup , when you install very very easy, good"
1,Quick starting and easy to use. This tablet is great for travel and games at night. E-mail checks are a snap. Low cost makes it something you do not need to worry about. Even supports e print to my HP printer. Buy 2 and enjoy it. No downside found yet.
1,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law on thanks giving and this is the best gift...They just love it to the best
1,"I love the free time application you can set it to, but don't care for the ads that always come up."
1,"I received the Dot as a gift and didn't even want one but I set it up and WOW! I was blown away with this little ""hockey puck"", device! Now this is coming from someone who still has a full stereo/phonograph system in the corner in a cabinet, but has not had it hooked up in years...just because. I did play music once in a while through Pandora on the tv but that's it. I liked the convenience of the dot and what it could do so much I took it bach and got the Echo and I like it a lot."
1,My family and I enjoy spending time together watching movies for relaxation and entertainment. The Amazon product has been easy to use.

1,"Really enjoy the echo. Can ask it just about anything. Has great speaker sound, love listening to my music on it. Excellent product. Glad i purchased it."
1,This makes it so much better to charge the kindle. It's small and easy to put in a case along with the cord and kindle.
1,The fire tv is super easy to use an super fast compared to the fire stick. Easy setup an all.

1,"Used several TV box before, and amazon fire TV's major pros is the root privilege to install app. So far so good. Quickly delivery!"
1,"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help"
1,"As an Amazon prime member I figured this would be cool to play my Amazon Prime music, but it's also a Bluetooth speaker that I can play My XM radio or iTunes through. Alexa is getting smarter and know my voice better with every question. She has my appointments and traffic and weather covered every morning. Great item here and great sounding speaker."
1,This is the first tab my niece is using and she is just loving it
1,I already have kindle 7 hdx love it. So I got this cheaper one for my son. He uses it to watch movies etc. Works great.
1,Endless number of titles to choose from at a very reasonable price. This e-reader is a great value.
1,"This tablet is so great. It's easy to use, the price tag is amazing! The App Store has a great selection. I would recommend to just about anyone."
1,This is amazons cheapest tablet and probably oldest in the market. Good for the price.
1,This Kindle works great for reading outdoors in daylight and can also download books using the Wi-Fi from the device.
1,I love the Amazon Echo because it is so interactive. Alexa responds to your commands and the speakers are excellent.
1,Purchased two of these as gifts for Christmas. No complaints.
0,Decent tablet for the price. Expect just basic use and function. This is no iPad be sure you aren't expecting that.
1,It was great for my 73 year old mother.She uses it for the Bible.
1,"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
1,I got this for my mom who wanted to cut down on her cable bill. It has worked great!
1,"The flush bezel and display are a huge improvement. The text is crisp and easy on the eyes. The page press function and inclusion/position of the touch sensors is perfect. The price seems a bit high for something as simple as an E-Reader, but if you love to read this is a must have. You will not be disappointed."
1,It was easy to setup. The kids love it! Pretty good battery life.
1,"The tablet was a gift and we are very happy with the standard options on the tablet. It's easy to use ,has a camera and is a great size ."
1,"If you don't have an echo or never played with one, you will be in for a treat. Words can't describe how much I love this thing. It controls home automated devices, finds information such as recipes, can do shopping for you, find reviews on products, play music, tell jokes, and so much more. I want one for every room. Now it will do phone calls and voice texting to people who have Alexa devices. The phone call on my weak internet was flawless."
0,"2nd kindle liked the first one better space bar located to close to change menu icons download is slow and have great internet service, device freezes up a lot and have to shut down and reboot, must close out any open tab to open a new one one happy with this model"
1,This was a perfect gift for my son for Christmas of 2015
1,"Echo is fun for the family. You can play music, games, get news and weather."
1,I like the fact you can talk to the device. More convenient than the others.
1,Great product for those interested in a simple e-reader and don't need to stream video.
1,"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!"
1,This device is amazing. It has all the latest tv apps as well as cable channel apps. It definitely will cut your cable bill in half
0,"Bought as gift, don't know the details, but kids love be it!"
1,"It's fast, content is great and as long as no HDR isn't an issue, it's a great alternative to the Shield at half the price."
1,I like this!! Its pretty cool it has a huge music library
1,I love my Kindle. It's fast and very convenient to carry around.
1,Bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!
1,I got this for my mom. I have a Kindle and there are always free games available for it but not for the tablet she had so i got it for her and download a bunch of games for it. The only problem is the games seem to drain the battery fairly quickly
1,I have 'Alexa' in the living room. Each morning I ask her the weather forecast and plan my day. If I need to go out I ask her the traffic conditions. While watching television I can always get inside information on shows as well as the actors and actresses. While playing cards with friends and family 'Alexa always finds the right background music for us. This is a great product!
1,We bought this for my Mother in Law for Mother's Day. She's not very tech but she's had no problem using.
1,My second Kindle and I was really glad to see that I didn't lose all my photos and books.
1,"Thank you amazon for making an affordable tablet that lasts! Enjoy the ease of navigating the apps. Good picture, and sound."
1,"Pro -Inexpensive, compact device.Con - lack of protective covers"
1,Love my Amazon Fire tablet because it's not too small and not too big. It's just the right size. It's light weight and the resolution is very good. I recommend it highly.
1,Great device! Fast response with remote control. Great voice recognition! Very reliable in terms of connectivity. Streaming 4k is a big plus. Overall great product.
1,"Has a great processor for its size, it's robust with lots of features and has a wonderful small remote that fits nicely in your hand. The remote has much fewer buttons then your standard remotes, which makes its very simply to use and along with Amazon GUI interface makes its simple to get around. I had other products that it competes with and this is by far the best, easier device to get around with."
1,"Great tablet for my grandchildren. It's sturdy and they can do many things on the tablet. Watch movies, listen to music, play games and text."
1,"Gave it to my mom, who hasn't turned on a computer in 20 years. Showed her a couple of things, now she is a pro."
1,"I'm not sure this device would have gotten much use if I didn't have any home automation devices. It is very continent to ask Alexa to turn off certain lights, set my thermostat to a certain temp and trigger events through IFTTT. I really don't use any of the other features like creating lists or scheduling events, but I do use the timer function while I am in the kitchen.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 -Other devices cannot utilize my Echo's speaker, I would like for SmartThings to be able to integrate with my echo to announce when someone walks through a main entry door, or if my garage door opens, which I know other Wi-Fi connected speakers are capable of doing.Echo to Echo connectivity would also be a nice feature, being able to say ""Play music in all rooms"" or while standing in the kitchen ""Play music in the living room"""
1,Alexa has been amusing and informative to say the least. She is a wealth of information. She saves time and energy also.
1,It's a great tablet for my kids at their age. I recommend it to anybody looking for one.
1,This fun device has changed our viewing habit. The diversity is great.
1,"Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching amazon prime ,YouTube or just checking face book or any other chats. Love to play games. The family loves it all."
1,Generally it is good. Sometimes the touch screen does not respond well.
1,I listen to my favorite music and podcasts with surprisingly good sound.
1,"I purchased this for my fiancé. She reads books with it,surfs the web, and watches Netflix on it. Very easy set up and easy to use. It also comes in different colors."
1,Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
1,"love it, great hd, smooth streaming with sd card--I've bought 3 as gifts and one for myself I like them so much"
0,"I purchased this firetv to upgrade my from first firetv version as I have a samsung 4k tv, this new firetv recognized my hdmi port as 4k compatible when I set the resolution to 4k on video settings, after trying all posible settings, this bug only gives 1080 even playing 4k content. firetv1=firetv2."
1,Enjoy the fire kindle and would recommend to people
1,Bought two for the kids. They are very happy. My only problem it that I have not been able to download movies to the SD card. I keep getting a message saying that the Kindle does not support it.
1,"kid love this, it can use for multipurpose game, video......"
1,Its a good product but the OS is kind of slow.Also when connected to the internet it will sometimes disconnect itself.
1,I've been using it for a while and can say that watching 4k streaming movies and shows are awesome.
1,"Excellent product for the price. Larger screen , light weight. Easy to download apps"
1,I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
1,Buy it. These are awesome. Love them! So much can be done with them. Best on the market. Worth the extra over the fire tv stick.
1,Easy to use...long cord.
1,My grand daughter wanted a tablet and this was a wonderful purchase for her birthday. The price was excellent and it does everything she was looking for and more. She never wants to put it down!
1,These are better for kids instead of those fancy and costly kid tablets if you set these up with right content they need. Resolution is not great though. You get what you pay for.
1,Great product for watching movies or using with kodi doesn't heat up as quickly as the smaller firestick
1,I purchased this for my husband as a replacement for his old one. He is very hay with it.
1,Got this for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it
1,"Best value tablet for the little ones. Great warranty, great parental controls. It's a shame Apple hasn't caught on to the needs of parents when it comes to digital media."
1,Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.
1,Good product. I will recommend this product because it is an amazing voice controlled item which does way more than you can imagine. The speakers are also loud for the size
1,"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product."
1,we got it in a deal of the day and gifted to my friend. HE is happy about this product
1,Very light very well made feels durable Easy to use everything Amazon
1,"The Kindle Fire is nice to use as a tablet to play games and surf the web as well as download and read books on. It has good speed, keeps a good charge and is affordable."
1,Very easy to use. Great for putting music on to use with wireless speaker
1,Excellent alternative to paying the big companies a bunch of money.
1,"For the price this is a great value, I considered a laptop, or larger tablets but am quite satisfied with this purchase"
1,"Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it"
1,Easy to use and similar to using a book. Love it! I would buy again!
1,"We got this tablet for my aunt so she could read, check emails, and play games. It is very easy to setup and use for anyone!"
1,Love to read and this little thing is perfect. I carry it everywhere. I read all the reviews and was on the fence since I used my phone or Kindle Fire to read but the lighting on the paperwhite is so much better for my eyes and the size is great.. Love this and highly recommend.
1,My daughter loves it and so does my son and wife too.
0,"The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those."
1,"Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price."
1,"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets. Awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others."
1,I got the Amazon Echo for my SIL for a Christmas gift and everyone in the family was jealous. They all want one! Purchasing it at Best Buy was easy and the best way to go since this was a popular item this year.
1,Love this echo well worth the price. No complaints
1,"Amazing tablet, does everything I need it for and upgrade tricks to make it even better. I like this tablet and all I can do with it...watch my shows, stream music, browse the internet and read my favorite books and comics."
1,"This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!"
1,Tablet work like charm and I never have issues with it
1,Never have a problem with my kindle fire got 4 of them
1,The Echo does everything it is advertised to do. Mine does things without a hitch that others have a problem with. Mine does lighting through my alarm system in a few simple steps. Works great!
1,This tablet works just as well as the big name one at half the price
1,"Even though I own both an iPad Pro and an iPad Mini, this is my preferred e-reading device. It's light and the battery lasts a good ten times longer than my iDevices."
1,We love Alexa!!! Awesome speaker! We have recommended to many friends and family!
1,"Good tablet for a travel companion. Good for playing games, streaming movies and as a reading tablet. Can add other apps as well. ."
1,I enjoy the my Amazon Echo so much I purchased a Dot for my bathroom.
1,Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.
1,This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate
1,I love to read and have other tablets but the kindle fire is light weight and was easy to set up There are alot of books and audio products that you can buy and get for free.
1,"I love getting weather, trivia and Music all from one sleek source."
1,"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do."
1,this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...
1,Its a great tablet for a low price. There are thousands of apps and electronic books to read.
1,Fun and easy to use. My son loves for Alexa to tell him jokes.
0,Was3nt used to an Amazon was used to android.this product is good just wasent used to it
1,Great product built structurally solid no issue and purchased 2.
1,Good interface but not as good as the Apple TV. I got it so we can get our cable TV app on our TV.
1,"With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time."
1,"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
1,The best product that I've ever watched a movie on I love the Amazon tablet it's does amazing things
1,"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
1,This works just as advertised. Wonderful to use this in an another room.
1,The Amazon Echo is a very nice addition. It's kind of like Siri without the need to hold a phone. I have it paired with my WeMo switches and so far it works great!
1,"If you want to stream video and use Kodi. This is the one to get. I bought this especially for the fact I could hard wire it to my router. No video pausing, skipping etc. Works great."
1,"I love the picture, easy to navigate, light weight and easy travel size . I bought 4 for Christmas presents."
1,"I had a kindle fire 3rd gen and I liked it a lot, but this one is better. I like the SD card slot for extra memory or to move pics from camera to kindle, book reading is great, I don't do many videos, but those I have watched seem to be fine. Graphics are good. Small enough to fit in my bag on the go, but big enough that I am able to type easily. Would recommend."
1,It's great and always getting better. I have three now. I listen to audiobooks constantly and use the white noise options while I sleep.
1,"Had the kindle 7th gen with no backlight and upgraded to the paperwhite. Was one of the best decisions I've made. You don't even notice that there IS a backlight because it blends in so well, and compared to the 7th gen is a night-and-day difference. Buy this, you will not regret it."
1,Boys gift to their mother for mother's day. She was thrilled to get it and still enjoys it. Great!
1,"I've purchased several kindles over the years & this is the only one that has given me issues. Purchased this one & exchanged it. I Eventually exchanged the exchange for the same reason. The first two kindles didn't want to turn on & would freeze. So far this one hasn't had any issues what so ever & does everything my mother needs it for (downloading thousands of books & watching videos non-stop)Docked a star due to complications with the first two. If I have to visit a store within the first month of a purchase twice, that is an issue."
1,"The fire stick has more than enough to offer in entertainment, something for every one's taste. The programming is not disappointing. The equipment is inexpensive and you.have control of any other expenses like subscriptions. Your bill will be far less than a cable bill and you will have more enjoyment from the programs. The only thing that needs to be done is having local channels available,. without an antenna which may or may not help reception.. I also miss OWN."
1,"I have the Fire Stick and added the Fire TV. The Fire TV is noticeable faster than the Fire Stick and more reliable. If you like the Amazon interface, which I do, go for the speed."
1,Bought to keep the kiddo entertained. Works perfect. Tons of free games.
1,"Love the tablet, my 4 year old uses the tablet on a daily basis! Perfect tablet for kids!"
1,I wanted a portable speaker that worked with Amazon prime music. There is nothing in the market right now that does that except for the Tap. For the $100 price its fine. I would rather spend $200 and get a better sound quality speaker though since it will be used outside as well as is in the kitchen.
1,Love the Amazon Fire TV line. I have fire sticks and the Fire TV for my parents. Both are great and easy to use. Nice set up and the ability to add memory is a great feature for gaming or for heave app users. Very convenient to have.
1,"The product overall is great. I got it as a Christmas present for my mom and she loved it.The only problem I had was with ordering. I was unexpected put on backorder when a Best Buy employee had stated and showed me I would receive the product the Tuesday after Christmas. Fortunately, I found the product in another Best Buy store and canceled my back order of the product. Great product overall, but 4 stars from me because this was the first time Best Buy ever let me down like that so I hope it doesn't happen again."
1,Perfect size for travel so kids can be entertained in the car and checking emails and watching shows and reading e-books very convenient for mom's on the go. worth the every cent
0,Not as good as the HDX but does well for $50. Also much slower than HDX. Screen is more pixelated than anticipated. Would probably spend more next time and get a quicker unit.
1,Excellent product. Simplifies wifi television viewing.
1,"I have the firestick but once purchasing this firetv, the firestick is now in a spare room and the firetv is my main device downstairs. It's very quick with minimal lagging. If you have a decent IP you will be very satisfied with this product!"
1,"We bought these kindles for a gift for the kids on Black Friday. The price was amazing and they are durable. I know we will get our money out of them. I love that there is parental control, you can password protect areas where you don't want the kids to discover yet. Overall, great value for the price."
1,My 6 year old grandson navigates on the tablet with ease. He's even taught me some things.
1,Kid prof and comes with free books and games I like it
1,Saved on cable bill and bought this on sale at best buy. Great device! Its better than roku and the google chrome.
1,It has some learning to do but its great to have it play my amazon music anywhere.
0,One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.
1,Got this for my nephew for Christmas and he hasn't put it down :) he loves it
1,Was given to my husband as a gift. He loves it. Said it was a great gift. Purchase it at a great price.
1,I like my echo because of the things it can do/tell me.
1,Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.
1,fire tv offers so many more channels to watch. Give you more than you ever had
0,"The tablet is okay, I mean it does the job. However, the wifi is really spotty. We even changed the wifi password (based on a YouTube video) to ensure that it works..but it keeps going in and out"
1,"This is a great product, the cost is incredible and proves other manufacturers prices are inflated."
1,One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
1,My son really likes the kindle fire and it so easy for him to use
1,"If you like to read books, I totally recommend this product. I love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. I used to read books on the iPad all the time but it would strain my eyes. After reading all the reviews I decided it was finally time to get a ereader. Since I had my iPad already I just needed one to strictly read books, so I got the paperwhite. It is so nice to read from especially in the sun. It's almost like reading from the actual book. It's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go.  There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad. At times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. The other con is that it's only black and white. It really isn't a problem when I'm reading, just for the children's books."
1,great tablet for the price easy to use and came very quick
1,Source of information and entertainment for the whole family! Would definitely recommend.
0,THIS ITEM IS GREAT FOR A 15 YEAR OLD. IT IS JUST WHAT SHE NEEDED.
1,She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school
1,"I got this for my husband because he only uses a tablet to read and occasionally look up items he's interested in on the web. It has been perfect for the light use he puts it to. He doesn't have a lot of knowledge about using computers etc. and this allows him to read, play simple games and check out guns and other things he's interested in without having to learn how to use anything more complicated."
1,"Super light, the paper white is a huge success and the battery life is as advertised. However, it is so light and small it mandates a protective case-BUT they are never in stock or otherwise available."
1,I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
1,We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
1,This was the perfect gift for grandkids. I bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color. Lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added.
1,I bought this for quick reports about latest news and for playing music.I tred for 2 days with help from Amazon technical services To hard to understand Tech. Had to send back and get a new one. Google home much easier to set up took only 5 mins.
1,Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
1,I bought four of these for.my kids for xmas. They haven't put them dwn willingly yet! I think it was a great deal for a great product!
1,It's alright personally the picture quality is pretty bad but I guess that's what you get for paying 50.
1,"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
1,Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment
1,Good picture for video and reading. Wish amazon would expand app store or use Google play
1,my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable.. I can put parental control on certain things.. great buy
1,I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.
1,Was a gift. The receiver really enjoys it and was an upgrade from her previous kindle
1,Very easy to setup. The navigation through the system is very simple. Great product
1,"This little box gives you endless TV episodes, tons of movies, 5 million songs, And Photo storage and display when linked to an Amazon prime account. It also allows you to get apps from all over the place and even play games. I am also streaming live TV with Vue thru this little tiny, shiny, black box. I am impressed."
1,Can not beat the quality of the product for the cost.
1,"Light weight, great upgrades from the paperwhite. Love it!"
1,I bought this to replace my Kindle touch. Since Kindle's no longer have speaker options. It's good for reading but to small to be used as a primary tool.
1,I liked this item so much that I purchased 2 more as Xmas presents.
1,"It is little slow at start up. But once its up. it works great. For the price, it is a great device. I play basic games, they run smoothly."
1,This was a perfect fit for my in-laws. Their lack of knowledge with tech made this the perfect gift
1,Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.
1,I'am having a lot of fun with the Amozon echo there is so much to learn i get email letting me know what she has learned and up dates The sound was really amazing for something so small
1,I had no Idea that this device would be so much fun to use. It's not an iPad mini but in many respects works just as well. It is the best $50 I've ever spent. I was able to root this tablet and install a custom rom which makes this even better. Its nice to know that you do not have to spend a fortune for a big name brand device to get the same quality Android experience.
1,"Works well - I used to have Kindle and Nook on my tablet, but find having the Kindle separate so much better. Holds a charge a long time and easier to tuck in my purse and take with me."
1,"I bought the Amazon Fire with realistic expectations. I have an iPhone SE (outstanding phone), so the intention was to be able to play some free games, view Facebook/etc on a slightly larger screen, some light web browsing, and maybe read an electronic book here and there. It has served this purpose with excellence so far. Not the fastest tablet you'll ever find I'm sure, but no slowpoke either. And I would venture to say you will be hard-pressed to find a better value for any piece of electronics at $50. Highly recommended."
1,My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.
1,I bought these as gifts. They were simple to operate and you can't beat it for the price.
0,I picked this up on Black Friday and ended up returning it the following week. This may be greater for an e-reader but can't replace a tablet for emails / amazon shopping.
1,My other kids have a tablet like this one and my youngest wanted one. They all love having their own and really like these. They were not a bad price either.
1,This product is excellent with apps available for many strraming services and capable of third party app implementations as well.
0,My God Daughter loves it it's just next time I should also get a screen protector for it because a few weeks later it has a small crack in it
1,Love the speed and apps offered through the unit. Had eliminated most of the buffering issues I've had with other streaming sticks.
1,"Love the look,feel and the light that this device has."
1,Wife enjoys the smaller version and the non glare screen
0,"Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account. It even asks for your credit card, but can be removed afterward. All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need."
1,"This unit is AWESOME! I totally did not expect it to be as good as most of the reviews but they were correct. What surprised me the most is the music sounded MUCH better than I would ever have expected. Even a technically challenged 59 year old grandma (me) was able to set it up with no help from sons, lol. SCORE! :)"
1,Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.
1,Works great! This tablet has a great picture and moves much quicker than I expected.
1,"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"
1,"This is my second purchase of a Kindle Fire, an upgrade from the original, which failed due to unintentional very rough handing by this user. It is an excellent device with significant improvements over the original. My only issue is that a particular app that I routinely used apparently was only available on the original and is not available on the latest model."
1,Does what it said on the fire tv. Not a bad Device.
1,It is everything it promised. I use it to download books.
1,I wish that they could be use simultaneously to create surround sound in the home.
0,Okay don't like the setup. I like Android way better. Cannot download you tube. It is for my six year old who has lost 3 3ds xls if he can keep this one from damage's for 6 months he gets an up grade.its very small
1,"Superb sound quality with deep bass and loudness, excellent voice recognition with noise cancelling. Lot of Alexa apps with integration with Logitech remote, Philips Hue home automation devices."
1,This is my first tablet. It's very user friendly. Like the parental controls on it. So my kids can use it.
1,"I love my tablet so far! It does everything I need it to. Movies, music, games, and books. I love it for streaming movies. The video quality is fantastic. Reading is also super easy and I don't get headaches from the screen. Definitely happy. Bought my hubby one too."
1,Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.
1,I love my Alexa she is great. I can ask her guestions anytime and she will answer. I would buy this again
1,My godson loves it. He's only 4 and thinks this is the best thing ever.
1,"Love that I can access my amazon prime, along with the other services I subscribe to."
1,"Really pleased with voice recognition and the different apps that work with it. Google Home does a bit of a better job when it comes to search queries, however."
1,Alexa is such a great addition to our home. I would recommend to anybody.
1,"I like the ease of speaking to Alexis, she understand voice request even in a noisy room and she is able to distinguish between my voice and TV or radio. She can instantly fill most request for music and info and I love the stages when you set an alarm. I am a bit concern that she is not loyal to just my voice and anyone around her can input to her and override my music or commands"
1,"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop."
1,My kids love them I brought four so far for my kids good quality at the right price....they still haven't put them down
1,"Got this to replace a Roku. Similar content but more features and a seems bit faster. Only knock is minor: could be a bit more customizable. But overall an excellent, sleek interface."
1,This is the most incredible device. I absolutely in love. The kids can play games on it and I can check the weather. She can do anything!
1,I especially like the ability to name an artist and have random songs played. My 3 year old grandson loves talking to Alexa also....asking her to play nursery rhymes that he has recently learned in pre-school.
0,"In my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. Limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. Also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. So I would not recommend to anyone."
1,It works good for kids and wherever you need for and good size
1,"Great Gift, can't wait to see my family's faces when they open this on Christmas!!!"
1,"Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps."
1,The Amazon fire tv has a better resolution 4K and it already has most Apps installed on it and you can install your own too. I haven't regretted purchasing this amazing amazon amateur!!!!
1,Tablet is good for all around use. My kids use most and like to buy music and books through Amazon.
1,The tablet is easy to access and it was affordable.
1,This is my second kindle. I bought the original kindle when it came out and loved it! I upgraded to this newer version only because I dropped my old one and damaged the charger port. I'm extremely happy with the new version and use it daily.
1,"This is just what my father wanted. It is portable, light weight and has an amazing backlight."
1,My entire family has fun playing music and asking Alexa questions. A great purchase for our home.
1,I am shocked at the super low price for a very functional and handy tablet. Easily the best tablet on the market under $50!
0,Slow with limited application. Battery doesn't last long and the download speed is less than expected.
1,Performs as expected. Appreciate the posting of new skills.
1,It's a good little tablet. I don't know if I would get this as my personal main tablet but the whole idea was for my son. He's loving it!
1,We love asking alexa stupid questions and its nice to just say what you want to listen to and it does it
1,"I have had several Kindle ereaders over the years also Nook, Kobo, and Sony as well, I even had the original Rocket Reader (I still have it) and they have all improved over the years so it's not surprising that the new Voyage is the best one yet. Over all I prefer the Kindle readers now and Amazon has perfected the eBook experience so why go anywhere else."
1,HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. GREAT TABLET . !!
1,Very ha day Very handy to have this plug I will use it what was that Very handy to have this plug will keep it as a as a extra extra one so that I can so that if I lose I lose the other plug I will have this one

1,This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.
1,"I love the convenience of using Alexa for anything from a timer to answering questions. Being able to get music on voice command is great as well, as I can pause and resume without grabbing my phone or a remote all the time. I would highly an Echo to anyone interested."
1,very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.

1,My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
1,Great gifts!! Very much enjoyed by my family members.
1,Like all the features and voice recognition is very good. Although the product was setup for Berlin weather which makes me think this was a returned device and resold.
1,Its a great alternate for expensive canle tv services!
1,"It is an excellent gadget for getting information on lots of things like weather, playing music, traffic etc. I highly recommend this for household uses."
0,Have a nook as my first e-reader. I like downloading library books better on the kindle but prefer the format of the nook.
1,We purchased 3 of these tablets for all of our children. They are perfect for them with little worry that they will get destroyed. Still functional for everything they do on them.
1,"Recommend anyone wanting to watch a wide variety of things from movies, TV shows or sports to get one."
1,Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
1,Love the kindle. Easy to use and lots of free books to read
1,"I bought this for my son, and I'm going to buy myself one because I keep using his."
1,Gave this as a gift for my daughter so she can read and now she loves it.
1,"Didn't know how much I would like this but after trying to read on my tablet outside I decided to give this a shot. Love it, I can read in the sunlight or at night no problem, and the battery life is great"
1,I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.
1,"It is a great tablet, I bought it for my 11 year old and he uses it responsibly. I also bought the glass screen protector and the sky blue cover for it in case he drops it. My son loves it and enjoys being able to not only play games on it, or take pictures, or even movies, but most importantly for the use of the advantages of it for its help when it comes to his education. I strongly recommend this product to everyone."
1,We have a lot of fun with the music asking questions Great tool
1,Bought 2 of these for my grand children. 4 and 2. They love them.
1,I really enjoy my echo. I also bought a battery for it so I can take it places
1,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! You can't beat it for the price!
1,This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
1,The Jetsons are finally here. This is technology that we only imagined watching episodes of the Jetsons
1,4k quality is great! The Alexa ffeature works awesome!!
0,I bought it for 34 $ during thanks giving. This is average product. I would suggest to go for Fire HD.
1,"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more"
1,"I don't use it nearly as much as I could. The kids love it. When they ask me questions I now tell them ""ask Alexa!"""
1,"lightweight, convinient, feels like book. Great at outdoor and night reader."
1,This was simple to install and allows me to stream all of my favorite programs.
1,This is very easy to use. Opened up so many show possibilities.
1,"I had a 1st gen Fire and enjoyed it but this one is a lot more fun. Love the dual cameras, the more user friendly interface and the ability to add apps from google play, so my apps are in sync with the apps on my phone. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a versatile tablet."
1,I buy several of these tablets each year as giveaway for clients at conferences and they are always a hit!
1,Love the larger speaker. Works great. use as a music source mostly.
1,"Wife purchased she said does what she needs, loves it."
1,"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
1,Cancelled my cable and i saved a lot of money from this..
1,Got this for my wife. Uses it everyday and performs great regardless of where your reading just like it's suppose to
1,"It had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate"
1,"I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time."
1,This is an amazing item for the money. Cheaper then my first scientific calculator many years ago.
1,I love that I can ask questions withouto having to go to a computer or cell.
1,"Great price, bought it to work with home automation products but haven't purchased those yet, that's next. Couldn't pass up the price and had points as well. We bought one with multiple accessories for our son last Christmas and he likes using the automation products. Generally similar to asking Siri things in an iPhone question wise. I like being able to add things to a shopping list and view then on my phone at the store. Still get several 'I don't know's' so only 4 stars so far. Probably a learning curve on our part too. Also good for cooking and converting measurements quickly. Like being able to control music and volume from my phone also. Glad we got it, looking forward to adding the home automation products."
1,Great little tablet for kids. Fast and easy to use.
1,"Makes reading books so easy, never loose your place when you stop."
1,"I purchased this device to use it in my work, and it's really did the job.."
1,This is an upgrade for my wife as her old kindle wouldn't charge anymore. She likes the feel and the games plus reading material. It rolled over most of her games easily tried to get her to buy an iPad but she has all she needs on thus device
1,"I had a Kindle Fire HD 6"" but felt it was too small a screen and too heavy for how small it was. The Kindle Fire 7"" is perfect for me. I don't watch movies or videos so not having HD doesn't bother me. I am enjoying this one more."
1,"I absolutely love the Amazon Echo. It was by far one of my best purchases. It can sync with nearly everything, and on top of it you don't need to get off the couch or out of bed to use it. It recognizes your voice and answers right away, without delay. I would recommend this for anyone!"
1,A great choice for children ages 3 to 13. Or even a great tablet for adults. It has many apps and games to choose from. The case it came with is very practical for beginners.
1,"The amazon reader is everything I dreamed it would be. I can read in the dark. It helps me get to sleep sooner, because the light is not as bright. My love of reading has only increased! ! A great purchase no doubt about that! !"
1,The Amazon Fire was a great price and exceeded my expectations.The picture is so sharp.
1,Great tablet for everday use and the screen has nice resultion
1,"Not only can you read books, you can do everything on it such as play games, order from Amazon login to Facebook and so much more!"
1,This was a great tablet for reading and searching the web!
1,Love this product has so many movies old to new as well as tv shows tv episodes. Its super.
1,Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.
1,Bought for my 8 year Old Granddaughter. She loved it
1,The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the inability to download directly from the Google play store. Otherwise good image and quick response.
1,I was impressed how clear the words on the screen are!
1,I wanted to find away to get rid of my extra cable boxes and that was it. It gives me even more than my smart devices.
1,"I love reading before going to bed, but backlit electronic devices tend to keep me awake just when I should be getting tired enough to fall asleep. The screen has a great resolution, the device is a snap to set up, and there's little to no glare if you take it outside. Additionally, the battery lasts just about forever. Straight out of the box I used it for almost three weeks before I charged I, and I still had nearly a quarter charge left. It's now my preferred reading device as compared to my tablets, which include an iPad and an LG Gpad. Highly recommended."
1,"I bought the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet while walking around and saw the price 34.99 at the time. got home and set it up immediately and added the Play store app by Google ( a bit tricky ) the device is nice to hold , battery is above average and the screen is nice to look at. my kids started using it and after that , I couldn't even get a turn to play with it. it's a great device for the $$ , even at regular price of 50 dollars, it still is a good purchase. my only ""concern"" about it is that I wish it had another 1 gig of ram , totalling 2 instead of just 1 gb ram. enjoy :)"
1,"I have been a kindle owner for years, the original kindle had be great but I hated the absence of a backlight. and the kindle fire was similar to reading on my phone with hurting my eyes. so when the paperwhite was released I was intrigued. I finally received this as a Christmas gift and it's perfect. the battery can lasts weeks on a charge. There's no glare. my eyes never hurt. this is perfect for anyone who just wants to read ebooks. there is no headphone or speaker so audio books will not be able to be used. when typing the letters are a bit leggy but you get used to it. I did have a problem registering my amazon account but was able to contact amazon via chat and they fixed it within 5 min. definitely worth the money, I can now have books with me at all times."
1,The ads aren't as annoying as you think they would be. Pretty lightweight and good battery life. Good for casual use.
1,My daughter loves her tablet. Amazon has plenty of games for her to play. It is also easy for her to use.
1,I wanted to find a tablet to give to my grandkids. Being able to spend 37.50 on Thanksgiving made this a no brainier for a tablet to give them. I was able to purchase 3 and they are really enjoying it. It may not be top of the line but it works great for them.
1,The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.
1,NEW LARGER SCREENIS GREAT FOR WATCHING PRIME MOVIES AND READING BOOKS
1,"Debated between firetv and Apple TV and ultimately went with firetv due to price. Works great, easy set up and easy navigation. I have not had any buffering issues."
1,I have all bought all three of my girls Kindles and they have all been happy.
1,Great product. Except you have to have it plugged in all the time. No battery! So using it wherever you want becomes a little more complicated.
1,"Love this! So easy to use and great for music or to get a quick question answered. Can't wait to get it set up all the way to control lights, etc."
1,I bought this for my daughter. I like that there are security features. She enjoys it and I have peace of mind!!
1,"my niece love it, of course her older and wild siblings like taking it from her but overall she say she love it."
1,easy hook up no fuse no hassle just plane easy plays music nice and loud the speakers are nice no distortion i enjoy it very must im glade i purchase this item
1,"Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline."
1,Purchased this black Kindle as a gift for my niece after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.
1,I personally love this because i can bring it every where i go and sing and its fun
1,This is a good beginning tablet. Works well and has lots of preloaded apps to start you off.
1,Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.
1,I control everything and am having a blast. So cool
1,"I purchase it for my wife, is very good, small and fast."
1,I got this kindle at a black Friday sale at a great price. My daughter loves it .She was able to set it up for more than one user so her and her boyfriend can both use it.
1,Love the echo. Great for listening to music and quick information
1,"BEST thing that ive ever owned. my review is a comment i left in response to someones unfair, inaccurate 1 star review:sorry to hear that YOUR echo is useless. Mine on the other hand is awesome. just today alone, i used it as an alarm clock to wake up, turn on the lights and music to wake the kids for school, check how much gas was in my tank without going to the car, re-order toilet paper and laundry detergent for a price cheaper than the grocery store, hear the news headlines while drinking the coffee ""alexa"" made me when she turned on the coffee pot, roll a 20 sided die for a dungeons and dragons game with my one kid who managed to avoid summer school, pipe music into my home all day, order pizza for dinner, and get help with the kids algebra homework. After dinner we played jeopardy on it after the show aired, and used it to dim the lights inside, and turn on the porch lights outside when it got dark and i couldnt get up without disturbing my sleeping baby on my chest, who incidentaly fell asleep to the echo playing soothing music....she can also tell you facts about EVERYTHING you probably dont know, including starwars which pleases the kids, tells jokes, plays rock-paper-scissors, AND can call you an Uber. Have you tried activating her ever increasing fuctions via the alexa app? Oh, by the way, her speakers sound better than the bose speakers in my car so...yeah"
1,Can't beat this lil tablet on value.Purchsed on black Friday so we got a great deal.Good battery life and the user experience is good too.I've had no problems with it and I am happy with my purchase.
1,Amazon has made a device that's very easy to use for a first time tablet user like myself.
1,Couldn't wait to get my hands on the fire tv. Better than the Apple TV
0,"Works fine for a $50 basic tablet/reader. Other functions, not so great. Very entry level."
1,Got them as Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts during the Black Friday. Works perfectly as an e-reader or as a basic tablet for watching youtube or reading anything online. You get what you pay for so don't compare this with Apple or Samsung. Happy with the purchase.
1,"BOTH CAMERAS WORK WELL. Videos are Great on this product. Down side is the on and off button seems to stick, I decided to see ifit can be fixed because I Like the product."
1,"I purchased the Echo for my husband as an early Christmas present. He loved it! We used it all during the holiday season to play holiday music. We use it every morning to check the weather. We also bought a smart plug and use the Echo to turn on our table lamp as we walk in the door in the evenings. We compete against each other in Jeopardy every day - he usually wins! As a result of my experience with the Echo, I bought 4 more for Christmas gifts and my enthusiasm for the Echo resulted it one being under many of my friends' families Christmas trees!"
1,"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
0,Data is tied to skills and should just be a blanket open forum of knowledge. Still has other benefits to explore.
1,This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
1,Works great.Great buy.Wouldn't have anything else.
1,"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!"
1,"Tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent."
1,"It is an excellent tablet, however it's app store is not as good as android."
1,"After using the amazon fire tv for about two months, I can say that this is an excellent streaming device. I connected the fire TV to through the Yamaha receiver to my TV, therefore I get a perfect 5.1 sound. Amazon service is acceptable except the fact that they kind of force you to buy different subscriptions or buy movies if you want to watch the new stuff on the market. But here is the good news, you can use the device even without an amazon subscription - with Netflix, PBS, and so many other downloadable applications. With an 128 GB USB flash drive formatted in FAT32, this device may become an ideal player connected to your TV"
0,"Decent screen, kinda slow response on the touch screen."
1,"Simple tablet that does what it is supposed to do. Don't be too worried about the 8 gig memory, you can use a memory card to upgrade"
1,"This is an android based devise, so you can do anything with it. Install Kodi and you are good to want anything you want"
1,"Loads of apps available, Netflix , PlayStation vue, Hulu , etc. very useful to setup in a basement with no cable outlet."
1,"Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies"
1,"Gave to my brother as a gift, and he takes it everywhere with hin"
1,Easy to set up and easy to use. The description is exactly what you get. I love this product for all its content.
1,"Tho she wouldn't make herself real for me, this is a nice gadget."
1,"This piece of electronics is amazing. Alexa can answer questions for you, give you weather and news updates, and play your favorite music. Have had the unit several weeks and am very pleased with it."
1,I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
1,I like the slick size and the whole voice remote. Now with Alexa you can even control your smart home devices. I upgraded from Fire Stick and the interface needs getting used to.... I like the stick lay out .
1,"Got this on black Friday sale & for the price, you couldn't beat it. I ended up purchasing 3 of these. The graphics & camera are definitely limited, but if all you need is a basic tablet to run Amazon apps, this is great for the price. The fact that it is expandable with an SD card puts it above the more expensive basic Kindle that my kids use that constantly is full."
1,works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well
1,I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it.
1,It works great for Netflix and amazon streaming I love these boxes
1,"Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to ""fade in"" animation in PowerPoint. I would prefer more seemless appearance of next page."
1,Highly recommend this box best box I have ever had
1,"The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook."
1,"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. I set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped. Free apps are good, some l get on my android are not available here. School websites dont work. Wish I had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase."
1,"We bought this for our second grader. It is great for her practice math apps, her daily reading, and fun time too! Plus it grows with her. As she gets older and likes different games, apps, etc., old stuff is radily erased and new stuff added"
1,I bought this for my daughters for Christmas but it has some limitations and doesn't let you do some stuff the other kindles did.
1,"I love it. Long battery life, easy to use, perfect"
1,Love the new look and feel of my new Kindle Voyage. I especially love how it adjusts the reading light automatically.
1,Great sounding speaker and microphones seems to work well. Good options for playing music as well as easy to set up. Wish there were better connection with iPhone so it is easier to request and play songs from iTunes as well as to make calls from phone.
1,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
1,We purchased this tablet for our 3 year old daughter. She loves playing learning and interactive games. This is great!!!!!!
1,"The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8"" tablet is just the right size."
1,I love this product. My wife was not too happy at first because I placed in our bedroom. Now she loves it as she can listen to music when she is putting on her make up in the mornings.
1,The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb - Pink is a great tablet
0,"I like Alexa, but limited. Can't connect with I-Tunes account yet. Can only set a one time alarm with 24 hours and cannot make it recurring. I see improvements weekly, but still a long way to go."
1,"I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase."
1,I love my firestick. We choose not to do cable to save money in our first apartment and it has been great with the firestick.
1,"If you are a reader, this is the e-reader to own. I have ipads, Samsung tablets and two nooks, but this is the one I love. Get yours!!"
0,The product is relatively inexpensive but the performance could be better.
0,"it does what its supposed to do, turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone"
1,Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.
1,Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
1,Researched this ahead of time and pleased so far. Good processing speed and no issues streaming. Got this specifically to get PlayStation Vue.
1,"Greatest item ever . For me, it is way better than cable. I bought one, it was so great, I bought 2 more, and gave away as a gift."
1,"Brought it for my toddler for xmas, so hopefully it works great."
1,Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
1,I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
1,Really have enjoyed this item.
1,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He uses it every day. It is easy to read on.
1,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked
1,"No idea as I haven't opened it up yet. I bought it for my non smart TV and as a potential replacement for Xfinity cable box. From the reviews, it should work fine for what I intend to do with it."
1,Just wish I could remember everything we can ask Alexa.
1,"A must have for music lovers. Alexa has enabled me to play Amazon prime music as well as Pandora, etc. I love the hands free operation. I am learning how to use Alexa to find out information and other new things. LOVE it......."
1,Not too big not too small. He can take he tablet for long rides so he's not bored and also learn with it.
1,Awesome tablet for the price. Great experience in store there to help when I needed it and not hovering over me while I browsed
1,"I decided to get the Fire TV after one of my remote Media Centers failed. With my movie collection on my server, I was able to install Kodi on the Fire TV and continue to stream my movies over the network. Add in our subscription to Netflix, HBO GO, Stars Play, and Amazon Prime membership, the Fire TV offers a wide range of entertainment."
1,"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!"
1,"Upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! Just it's kind of expensive for an e-reader."
1,"Is very easy to operate, bought as an extra for when Grandchildren visit because I love to use mine to read and couldn't if they wanted to play with my reader !"
1,"Amazon always has great products, I would purchase again"
1,"I got this for a Christmas present for my son, but couldn't help myself. It's awesome. Looks like momma is rewrapping for him, or buying another :D"
1,"Purchased to replace old Kindle. Was surprised at cost difference, though."
1,Great tablet if you have an amazon prime account. Not able to download some apps that are current. works better if you stay with in amazon.
1,Great product plays my music controls my lights tons of info also makes an awesome alarm clock and it keeps getting smarter.
1,"I read a lot, this tablet makes it convenient for me to carry many books without all the weight. The screen lighting is adjustable for different light situations."
1,Bought the tablet for a larger screen than my phone. Love it.
1,"It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI. Haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. In the end, it's a >$50 tablet, but a decent one at that. But you defintely get what you pay for"
1,Bought kindle for a gift as the one my daughter had 5 years ago starting not to work right. She loves this rader and got good reviews about it.
1,I loved the amazon echo. Been wanting one since it came out and broke down and got it. Great choice
1,I bought this for a Christmas gift. They love it! Very happy with purchase.
1,"Replacement charger for my son's Kindle, works great, highly recommended."
0,"This is definitely not an iPad or a high end tablet. Nevertheless, for the discounted price that i paid on it (so, less than $50), it is well worth getting. I wanted something bigger while waiting for the next iPad Air to come out, and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet. It is geared towards Amazon media consumption, ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than HD. If the sale comes back again where it is $15 off, I would not hesitate to recommend it again."
1,This is a great product to purchase I love that you can watch whatever out there too watch with out leaving the comfort of your own home
0,"We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8."
0,"My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one."
1,best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
0,Bought this for a friend in the hospital.very easy for him to use as he uses it endless hrs.the picture quality is good also ..would buy product again
1,I love these because they are able to be programmed and watch anything and everything in the world!
1,I bought this as a raffle prize and it was a big hit of the young as well as the old.
1,I love the convenience of the Amazon Echo! Alexa is amazing! Very easy to use!
1,"I had the 1st Kindle, but this one is much better!"
1,Kindle e reader is a wonderful device. I like the inbuilt light. It does not hurt eyes and it does not have side effects (headache or hang over in the morning) if used in the night unlike tabs.
1,"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
1,Great tablet that can be used for kiddos and those not great with technology.
1,"The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
1,The best ebook reader in the market. The text is crisp and I love the backlighting.
1,"ECHO is great, still learning but Alexa is full of apps skills. Love how responsive it is."
1,"This box has it all! Does 4K and also has a super fast Quad Core Processor. Has great WIFI AC, and also has the Ethernet plug in. Great Streaming machine, but the best thing about it is the PRICE!"
1,Works well.great for playing games and daily information
0,"It takes a lot of time and subscribing to get the channels I want, so I will write another review next year when I got them all..hopefully !!"
1,Excellent device to have if you travel a lot. Hooks right up to the hotel TV and gives you access to all of the great content you have at home. Works great!
1,Alexa is the most useful product I have purchased. My Husband is handicapped and home all day while I work. He asks Alexa to put the lights on for him and she does. He ask her to tell him a joke and she does. Anything he wants to know he turns to Alexa...
1,"I Love The Sound, The Sleekness, And Help With Questions, The Music She Plays While Im In The Kitchen Cooking.No More CD,S, Or Tapes. I Have Her Sister The Dot In Another Room, I Use Her For An Alarm Clock.I Think Every One Should Have One.;)."
1,For the price. You can't go wrong. If you're looking for something basic and don't want to spend a lot of money. Here's your tablet. Good for kids that will pretty much will ruin you're expensive ipad or something.
1,Excellent love it works great love design..wonderful
1,"My wife bought it for her office but they wouldn't allow her to use the wifi so she brought it home. Use it mostly for music and asking silly questions, but we enjoy it. Broadens our musical library."
1,Bought as a gift for my husband. Works as expected.
1,"My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday and immediately I realized I needed a cover. I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it."
1,I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I can read at night without my eyes bothering me. The builtIn light is an awesome feature. The screen looks just like the pages of a book.
1,"Great gift for a kid to read, surf and play music!"
1,Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend
1,"The echo is a great product to play hard to find music and keep you updated on weather, current events, and trivia information."
1,"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
1,Great for kids. Has many applications that can help kids learn more and easier
1,Very nice people and good product. I would buy from again.
1,"I bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. I like the size, the sound and picture/movie quality of it. It was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice.. I didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact I can't get all of my important apps that I used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. Other than that, not too bad for the price and other features I named previously."
1,I purchased this tablet based on price and the reviews for tablets in this price range. It has performed well for my child. I especially love the parental controls that are easy to setup and the ability to have multiple profiles on 1 device. I'm now thinking of buying one for myself to replace a stolen iPad.
1,Does just what it says. Easy to set up and use. Great alternative to cable.
1,I bought this product for my 4 year old grandaughter and she loves using it
1,I really like the echo for controlling my hue lights. Sometimes it will do stuff with out even saying alexa though other than that decent product
1,"Good tablet for the price. It is fast, battery life is ok."
1,"I love this streamer. The fact that all the apps I use are on this machine and the service from Amazon is amazing, it's very worth the money. Alexa is easy to use also. A recommended buy."
1,Works great wife uses it everyday she downloads books from amazon
0,"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality"
1,"So easy to use anywhere there is an outlet. I had a charger that would work,so I debated about buying this. I'm so glad I did."
1,Second Alexa in our house and we love it. Don't need a radio anymore. She plays a whole CD or will scan through all the song of one particular artists or group.
1,The Amazon Echo is one device I could not imagine being without. It is always there for music and any random question I have.
1,i no longer us tv this is my new go to for my tv show needs
1,Love reading on my Kindle. So many book selections.
0,Bought this for my 12yr old son. Can't get him off of it. Gave it 3 stars because it doesn't support google play store and doesn't load most pics on pinterest sometimes. You might need a memory card if you purchase 8gb tablet.
0,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
1,I love it. Work good well .like to get a few more of my home
1,Great iream i use it kodi and runs great easy to install.
1,Great Tablet for the Price. It was on sale for $39. I was surprised by its quickness.
1,"I have an Apple TV and was skeptical at first to buy the AFTV. However, I am so happy to have switched to the AFTV. So much freedom, yes!"
1,It is inexpensive so you can get many of them. It also has a speaker.
1,Bought it to replace my nephew's tablet that I broke. He loves it.
1,Great tablet my 2 kids have 3.They have an extra one for the roadI would definetly recommend it.
1,First time I have ever used a Kindle Fire and I wasn't disappointed. It is very good tablet. The only downside is that there aren't that many apps like the Google store has.
1,My daughter like her tablet it's so simple to use.
1,"And this is amazing. Blows Apple TV out of the water with all the customizations..especially Kody. I have every apple product that currently exists, including all their computers, however, I will be replacing all my 4th gen Apple TVs with the Fire Tv."
1,"Old Kindle was not working consistently very well, so purchased an new Kindle Paperwhite that is backlit and it is a great improvement over my old Kindle...loveit!"
1,Only negative is pop-up ads. Don't quite understand the need for ads.
1,This is a good product and streams very well for all of our favorite online services!
1,I bought for my mother for a gift and she lI've it
1,Enjoying this Streaming Device. I can watch my favorite Movies and Shows on 4K UHD Quality
1,I am very happy with my Amazon Fire TV. I set my 19 year old daughter to install it and she had it up and running in a matter of a couple minutes.
1,My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play… Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.
1,I've had several kindles over the years and this is by far the best one yet! I love the paper white and will never go back to anything else. I use it everywhere! You will not regret this purchase!
0,My 2 year old loves this thing. Uses it mostly for Netflix. Major issue with this is that it barely has any memory. It is very limited as to what and how much you can put on it.We have about 10 apps/games or less and Netflix app. It will not allow anything more as it has no space.
1,Very handy and easy to use! I recommend this product!
1,Would recommend for anyone great value big screen great features
1,This is the most amazing thing!What can't it do? Say a command and instantly you'll get it. Incredible!!
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandchildren over the holidays. they are 3 and 6yrs old. they love it . it's easy to use - and they are able to scroll through the programs easily.
1,Not very much 4k content but it still get the job done
1,"The Echo is great, I use it every day! Great for music while doing the dishes, all I have to do is give a voice command and don't even have to dry off my hands. Every morning I wake up and can't open my eyes because I'm so tired, so instead of looking for the weather I just ask Alexa and plan my day accordingly."
1,"It's a great product, I would buy another for a family member. I do hope they lower the price a little in the future"
1,I really enjoy this new kindle much brighter and easier to read
1,"Very large, pretty quick processing, great picture"
1,you will never be lonely again she talks to you and answers questions she can read your kindle books too and tell you the weather she will tell you jokes she is well worth the money also play music from your library and ihart radio and much more things
1,"It has a great picture. But, This is not different from the original fire stick."
1,This adapter helps free up computer ports so that charging my kindle is not in my way.
1,I absolutely love reading on the Kindle Paperwhite. It's great being able to sit outside and read and not worry about the glare. It's very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand.
1,Absolutely love my Kindle fire. Would buy for friends and family. It is the perfect combination of a tablet and e-reader.
1,Good streamer especially helpful for children. Having a Netflix account helps.
0,"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to."
1,"The amazing Amazon echo. That is the perfect heading for the speaker. Actually it's far more than the speaker, this may be one of the best purchases I've ever made. I use it to order an Uber, to order pizza, to look up recipes and to buy things on Amazon simply a genius product."
1,Loved the item - worked great. Packaging was good. I was very pleased
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it Many apps for kids
1,This Kindle is better than any I have had before. Love the multi-brightness dimming ability. I have zero complaints with this item.
1,"For the low cost what's not to like. Be careful what/how much you load into the limited memory. An excellent entertainment tool especially when powered with PRIME. Screen (movies & Tv) display excellent. I recommend a ""glass"" screen protector. Helps greatly manage finger smudge. EZ to setup. EZ to use. EZ on your wallet."
1,"This is my first E-Reader but I have numerous mobile devices and I can say without hesitation that this reader is awesome. It's just like reading a book. I have no complaints, fits my needs perfectly. Very pleased with my purchase."
1,I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
1,"We heard the hype and did not think we would like it or use it...purchased it on sale for $89. This gadget is way cool and is fun to use. Very useful for playing Amazon Prime Music. We like it for getting the news and weather instantaneously. We integrated it with Nest and WeMo and it works pretty well. We had hoped it would work with our Sonos system but allegedly that integration is coming by the end of 2017. The speaker isn't bad and overall, we are happy with Echo and it's a nice to have for what we paid for it."
1,"Great for reading books. Print is easily readable. There are a couple of font sizes to adjust to your eyesight, as well as different font types to choose from. It's very easy to change them on the fly without going deep into settings.It has nice features, such as dictionary, where you can quickly check unfamiliar words while reading, create notes, or write and read reviews.Getting books to the reader is straightforward as well. If you have wi fi connection, all you need is to create account. The selected books will be automatically transferred to your reader.If you don't have wi fi, connecting the reader with USB cable should be enough, but make sure if that works before you buy it.Battery charge lasts for a few weeks. You don't have to worry to charge it every day.The charger is not included though. Either you can charge the reader through your computer or buy the charger.Charger is faster and more convenient.There are a lot of websites offering Kindle books, there's a big selection of free books to choose from too. Public libraries, Amazon, number of various websites provide wealth of readings for Kindle.Overall, I'm very satisfied with it.On negative note, I wish the screen was a little bigger, as I don't carry it around, and it's not cheap either."
1,This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.
1,"This is my 3rd Kindle, and we are very pleased with the ease of use and features Amazon has to offer. I suggested my brother get one for his kids and he too is happy. He actually uses it as much or more than his kids do. If you are looking to buy one, I suggest buying a case to help protect it from any bumps or bruises. I lost my 1st Gen Kindle because it was dropped without a case."
1,"An excellent product, easy on the eyes when reading. Lots of apps and access to a wide variety of books, catalogs, magazines and news outlets. I would highly recommend it."
1,"I use it every single day. In the kitchen for cooking timers, to listen to music, and to control lights in our house. It has definitely made our busy lives convenient. Highly recommend it if you are thinking of automating your house."
1,I was searching for a tablet that would be great for reading books and downloading games. This kindle is the right size for a tablet. Works great!
1,Such an amazing product. Sounds great and works perfect.
1,This holds my grandson attention on a regular basis.
1,was skeptical at first because I thought it would be the same as the fire stick.Boy was I wrong.4k is awesome on my 4k tetevision.
1,"The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser, and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet."
1,If you like to read and travel this is the answer to that problem. You can read just about any paper in the country at any time.
1,"Real easy to use. Great price. Got 2 of them. One for me and one for my friends son. He uses it to download free books to read, and games to play."
1,If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
1,I got this on thanksgiving! It was super cheap and I'm glad they had it in stock!
1,I love these Amazon products! I have so many Amazon products at home I refer everyone gets one
1,Bought this for my nephew for christmas who has been asking for a tablet. It was on sale for an outrageous deal and couldn't pass up. Works fine and he love it. would recomend
1,I really enjoy this kindle. It's fun to use and cool.
1,Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case
1,"I purchased he Fire because you can do more with it. I have an Apple TV (2nd gen) and I enjoyed it, but was looking for something a little faster. So far it's been great. Being able to side load other apps has been great and the Amazon Prime content is pretty good."
1,Set it up for my husband and he loves it. Was a great value for product.
1,Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
1,"I bought this for my aunt. She reads all the time. As she got older she hated carrying multiple books with her everyday and when she traveled. This Kindle solved all those problems. She especially likes being able to read magazines, periodicals, and check out library books electronically. She loves this thing!!"
1,I love my Alexa product. Even considering getting the smaller speaker for my bedroom so I can listen to music to fall asleep
1,I bought this one for my mom because I love mine so much
1,"After reading several reviews, I purchased this as my first Kindle because it wasn't the lowest-level Kindle but I didn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive one. I purchased this specifically because of it's size and ability to read outside with no glare issues. The ads are not annoying enough to make me wish I paid more for the ad-free versions. It is a perfect price-point for reading outside and on the go."
1,This was purchased for a 2nd TV. No issues- love it
1,"I'm currently living in Korea and needed American television to keep me entertained. I had Kodi installed on a FireStick, however, despite having a 100Mbps service plan, my wireless connection couldn't keep up with the bandwidth hungry programming. My solution was to purchase the FireTV and hardwire my internet connection via ethernet. The difference was immediately noticeable, I haven't had any buffering issues and programs load up immediately. I would definitely recommend this device if you live in an apartment where the air is saturated with WIFI signals and plan on using bandwidth heavy applications such as Kodi. The ethernet connection ensures that you are getting a clean signal and using the maximum bandwidth speed of your ISP."
1,Have another ereader but wasn't able to read it outside. This is much easier to read outside. It has lived up to expectations.
1,i got tihs so i can watch hulu and netflix and it is pretty fast
1,"Love it, talk to it all the time. Even tell it good night every night !!! She is pretty smart !!!"
1,Came in great packaging. Everything is there. Works great!
1,"I bought the Amazon Fire for my granddaughter for her 8th birthday. She just loves it so much. She said it was the right size and everything. Truly excited her, Grandma gets an A+! I would like to add that the $49 price tag for this high quality tablet can't be beat."
1,The plug seems to be working well. I think it's the connection in my Kindle that is worn out!
1,"Bought them as gifts for my nephews, who are teenagers, and they love them. Obviously you cannot expect them to be as high quality as the $400-500 tablets, but for $35 on black Friday they will serve their purpose."
1,My niece loves her kindle tablet. She uses it all the time.
1,This is by far my favorite tablet on the market. Has all that high priced tablets ioffer
1,"This nice, color e-reader doubles as an excellent low-cost tablet."
1,This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
1,"This Amazon Echo Literally is a plug and play product. Even an old man, old school non-techie like myself was playing stump the band in no time."
0,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
1,Works fine as advertised. Will recommend it to anyone.
1,Bought this tablet just to use in 1 room. It works great!
1,The Amazon Fire TV box is a wonderful device. I love the Alexa voice search feature. Wish there were more movie options for Amazon Prime members.
1,This was a great present for my husband who is extremely tech savvy and very particular about his choice of equipment. He was overjoyed with this. Glad I choose to stick with Samsung.
1,This is an very good to use in all areas. The letters are very clear.
1,"I love having this in my home. It does so much I have barely scratched the surface with it. I have Amazon Prime so I can call out whatever music I am in the mood for and it will more times than not play. I haven't yet used it for lights, Uber, or any of the other many things it can do. A lot of fun."
1,We love this device it controls the lights in home
1,My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.
1,This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
1,I can get to anything I'm needing to from the home screen. Helps simplity everything!
1,Bought the two tablets for two of my younger grandkids. So far the tablets have held up well. My daughter likes having the ability to limit what the kids can use the tablets for.
1,It's pretty fast response time on switching between apps and pretty good 4k visual also.
1,"I bought one for my 7 year old and one for my 3 year old. I love that I completely control the content and time use. It's easy to use, and small enough for kids to hold."
1,"Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!"
1,"This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it."
1,"Love this Amazon Fire TV. I hooked it up to my bedroom TV and started watching all of my favorite shows on Netflix, and other apps that comes on this! Great!"
1,The sound is not good but it was easy to set up. Alexa itself his limited capabilities.
1,great tablet and great price that I purchase 3 for all my children. They have no complaints. And if it breaks I can easily afford buying a new one.
1,Easy to use grandson enjoys it .plus the two year warranty you can't beat kids can be rough on tablets.
1,I got this for my wife and she loves it. Uses it every day
1,"I purchased this tablet for my 2 year old niece, and it works great, no issues at all, she mainly uses it to watch barney and Elmo episodes... easy to setup parental controls for safety... easy to handle especially for a child, very small and lightweight... recommend to all"
1,The Echo is awesome! I purchased this with the intention of controlling my Hue Lights through voice however it has much more features than expected. My wife now turns it on daily for iHeart Radio. I purchased this almost 1 month ago and I'm still discovering new things with it. The only issue is there is no Plex app however I'm sure one is in the works soon.
1,"this is a great item, I used it to replace my tv. A+"
1,This tablet is perfect for my lil brother. He love it
1,I have owned a few kindle's in the past and this one works as good if not better than the others. I'm an avid reader and I get a lot of use out of my kindle and it's small enough to fit just about anywhere. I love that it comes in different colors too!
1,"Bought as replacement for Kindle HD 7 2012 model. Works great, considering the price. The expandable storage is awesome!"
1,This is a nice tablet for the price. Functional for your basic needs.
0,"I purchased this device to stream movies to a room that had minimal apps. The I tried to activate Netflix, I kept getting an error on log-in. Then after contacting Amazon Tech help & researching found out that Amazon & Netflix parted ways and do not support each other. So, I returned the device and purchased the Roku4 instead to great satisfaction."
1,I am able to read in any sort of light and able to change the font size.
1,I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
1,Very simple setup and a great little item for the price.
1,"I wasn't looking for anything complicated just something to read books on, play a few games, watch videos. At those things it does very well."
1,This was purchased for my daughter. She absolutely loves this tablet. It's a perfect size for her. She has not stopped using it since we gave it to her. It's an excellent product to keep her busy and entertained. The graphics are awesome. The price we paid was well worth it. We will keep shopping at Best Buy
0,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.
1,"I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied."
1,Our child has had one for a few years now and his cousin wanted one so we bought one as a gift. Cannot get the two of them to put them down.
1,My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now.
1,I bought 2 of these for my niece & nephew! They think I'm awesome now!!! I'd say they were definitely worth the purchase.
1,"Small yet powerful; HDMI connection, 4K capable. Amazon content plus Android framework. Nearly perfect!"
1,Works great with my older Kindle!
1,One of the best streaming services out there amazon fire tv is a great product.
1,So cool & easy to use. It was easy to connect & sounds really good.
1,This device works like butter. Better than Roku. Tx
1,We bought Alexa for Father's Day.. my husband is so attach to this Robot and we are too!!
1,"The Paperwhite is an excellent product. It is very lightweight, easy to hold for long periods of time, and user-friendly (software wise). Be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet (or Amazon Fire); this is because of the e-ink. However, I will take the trade off, as you are able to read e-ink in every environment (sunlight, dark rooms) without any eyestrain -- something that is not possible with a regular tablet. Screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this.If you have a Prime membership, you have access to all of Amazon's library, which has a large selection; however, most disappointingly, you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to Amazon's Kindle App, which is an additional $10/month. I find this to be mildly frustrating. However, you are able to rent books from your local library whenever you would like.Overall, I think the Paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading, with only a few drawbacks. I enjoy reading on it very much."
1,great for the kids and protection is good ! and best buy is making me write more stuff here so that people can go ahead and buy this product...
1,Great item.... good addition to home and family. Recommended for everyone!
1,"I recommend this to everyone, the ability to get information that is quicker than a push of a button. Awesome"
1,This was a gift to a friend and she loved it! It's great for a starter tablet and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tablet at a great price!
1,"Don't hesitate to purchase. Works great. My son has the Fire Stick which works great, but this Fire TV is so much faster and more responsive. Love it."
1,Does well when you speak loud and clear. Easy to setup just use your phone and add the WiFi password
1,"I'm a computer geek so I excited when my Wife go me a tablet for Christmas. I enjoy playing games, reading books/magazines, and like the small compact size with power."
1,Amazon free time great for small kids to get entertained
1,"My 2 year old grand daughter loves it. Amazon has a lot of age appropriate apps to download. I know longer have to have my precious girl snatch at my phone saying ""My toy Papa!"""
0,My 4 yo grandnephew and 3 yo daughter love them! The tablet does freeze but that's what happens sometimes! They love them!
0,"When you buy an Amazon product from Best buy they will not take responsibility after two weeks and said to speak to Amazon directly,But you cannot return any Amazon products bought from Best buy to Amazon, Do not buy Amazon products from Best buy but ever again as you are doomed with it"
1,"I love my new Kindle! I have owned them all and each one improves on the last. It's a great way to read! I have the origami book cover as well and did not expect to like it but actually, I love it!"
1,Having fun exploring the capabilities. The sound quality is great!
1,It is amazing! Most wonder product ever bought! Would recommend it
1,I need the Geek Squad to help me with the Amazon Prime I purchased it for 2 granddaughters but I don't want them to have access to my books.
1,One of our best home purchases. The echo has been very helpful to us daily.
1,Easy to set up. The parental controls and safety features make this a great purchase.
1,The tablet is not bad at all for the price I paid during Black Friday. The only issue for me is the occasional pausing during streaming on netflix
1,It's a great table for kids and first time user of tables.
1,Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.
1,I purchased it to read books and I love the fact that I can play games on it also. Works fine and is easy to use and for the price I do not think you can go wrong.
1,Love my Amazon echo! Everything exactly as advertised
1,I love Amazon now there's so much functionality especially with video. This works great and the quality is amazing
1,Reading in bright sunlight is now easy on the eyes
1,My daughter can't get enough of this tablet. The only thing I would suggest that you have YouTube kids as a pre installed app. The adds are ridiculous for children when you download it from the App Store.
1,I bought three of these units. On sale for $34 apiece. Great deal. Great price
1,"Runs better that a fire stick and it buffers faster two, great for streaming Netflix, and Hulu in HD, I haven't had any issues with these programs and if you have amazon prime you can link your account for streaming, purchasing and renting titles."
1,Bought three of these during the Black Friday sale for family gifts. Everyone loved them. Cheap and fun little tablet to have.
1,"If you plug the prongy side of the adapter into the wall, and then plug the big end of the USB cable into the non-prongy side, and then plug the little end of the USB cable into your Kindle, it makes books magically appear on the screen. Use your eyes to read the words, and your eyes will transmit the information into your brain."
0,"I had originally decided to get a kindle instead of an iPad due to the cost. It's a great screen and has good sound, but the battery is pure junk! I should have went with an iPad."
1,This device is wonderful and very handy. I really like this very much.
1,"So far, I've enjoyed all that the Fire TV has to offer and its functionality. It's very responsive and loads shows/movies/music instantly. The only thing that is annoying, is that the remote will intermittently not work. If I tap the remote, take out then reinsert the battery, it will work again. I've tried replacing ""new batteries with ""new batteries"" with the same result. Not sure if it's a glitch with emitting diode signal from the remote to the unit. It's not very frequent, so I tend to over look it. The unit and the remote will occasionally go through software updates, so I'll see if that takes care of it first."
1,"The echo works great around the house. From setting timers, to listening to music, to reordering paper towels."
1,Bought the Kindle for my grandkids they just love they play with it all the time they use it to read books play games they just love it
1,"Purchased after reviewing online, and it has lived up to all expectations."
1,Echo dot on steroids! Love it. Own the dot AND the regular echo.
1,"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
1,STill learning all that goes with Alexa. I also appreciate the email updates on the product
1,Bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it. Fairly easy for him to use and me to monitor. Definitely recommend the case.
1,The tablet works great! No problems or concerns! Great for kids also.
1,"This echo does just about anything, just ask her and she has the answer. She works together with my harmony remote perfectly. Cant wait to link her to my hue lights !!"
1,"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
1,I recently cut the cord with cable and couldn't be happier. This fire TV box has made it so easy with so many ways to watch programming. I love it!
1,I am so pleased with each and every product I purchased!!!!! Everything is GREAT!
1,Blazing fast and ready to go if you are an Amazon fanatic. All I had to do was link it to my wifi and my account - and DONE!
0,"Hated it ! You have to purchase everything from Amazon ! Took it back within a couple days! Got the roku ,,,,, way better !"
1,I use this device in my office to stream music and keep up on the news. Overall a good experience so far.
1,"Great tablet for kids since it's price friendly, and it has an option for child users."
1,I would highly recommend this product!! I wish that I had purchased this item a long time ago!
1,"We have 2 Roku 3s, and we like the Fire TV better. It works so much better with our SlingBox...you don't have to go through your cellphone. Our Rokus freeze up frequently, but the Fire TV has only done this once. (So far!) We will probably buy a second one for our bedroom and move the Roku 3 to a guest bedroom."
1,Easy connection and very good playing different apps.
1,Alexa is the greatest product ever I use it around the house all of the time
1,"I had to pick this up, for the deal of the day, when I saw it."
1,I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.
1,Very stable system. Pretty much identical to fire stick. Only pay more money to stream limited 4k content.
0,"The Paperwhite is certainly better than the regular Kindle, primarily due to the back lighting feature. If you buy a Kindle eReader, this would be the one to buy. You could spend more for the higher end models but there's really no need. The main issue with this eReader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen. I tried two Paperwhites and both had the same issue. Perhaps this is just how they are."
1,"Love it....the color is bright which makes it easy to find in a suitcase or carry on bag. I carry lots of stuff in my pocketbook because the color is neon yellow it stands out. So easy to grab and read. Took it on vacation loved it. I recommend the color cover rather than black one,"
1,"I am extremely happy with the box, well over the stick. Twice as fast, twice as much RAM and up to almost 30 times as much memory"
1,Good tablet for a good price. Great for our 8 year old
1,I hope to find all my books in the electronic format.
1,My daughter loves it! This device provided all the services she wanted.
0,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old it's a good tablet for the 33 dollars I paid. I just wish I could remove some of the Amazon apps.
1,Works great. TV how you want it watch movies and tv shows anytime.
1,"the price was right and I wanted it for it's ease, because I will be using it in my door to door ministry. thank you,"
1,I love my kindle paperweight! It is great upgrade from the kindle touch
1,Purchased this blue kindle as a gift for my nephew after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.
1,This was the perfect gift for my mom and she loves it so much. She reads like crazy and this does not hurt her eyes like other devices. Great product and recommended for anyone who reads at all!
1,The Amazon box works so much better than the fire stick less lag and buffer.
1,Thank you they were great gifts for my sisters loved it
1,Nice tablet. Great gift item. Gives me flexibility in being able to check email and play games anywhere in the house. My only wish is that the screen were a little larger.
1,"This is a very good tablet for the price (about $50 regular price). Good image quality and battery life. Have been a Prime member for several years, so the included media access - videos, audio and books - is great. It is NOT an android tablet, so much of the Google ecosystem is not available. The Amazon AppStore has lots of options, but not nearly as many as the Google Play Store.Would recommend adding a microSD storage card. Also would get better file manager and video playback apps. There are several good, free options from Amazon's AppStore."
1,I'm buying 2 more for gifts. I love them. I have 2 already
1,Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.
1,"I bought a few of these Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) boxes and I don't notice it performs any better than the older model even its specs are showed that it has better hardware components. Just for the fun of it, I have rooted and am still learning what else can I do with it..."
1,This tablet is perfect for my needs which are mostly online books.
1,I like the Kindle but have had to restart it twice as it froze.Still a great way to travel and still have books available to read.
1,I have so many different apps that I use to watch my movies and TV and this device groups them all. The remote makes searching a breeze and Alexa is entertaining to talk to. I would get multiple of these. Amazon is adding a LOT of great features to prime. Oh and I hope you have PRIME when you get this. If you dont your wasting money. Get prime and get the fire TV
1,"well worth the money, it's just a pretty well thought out tablet, the interface is designed well enough for a child to a grandmother to use with relative ease.it's also powerful enough to play a great variety of fun, good looking games. which is pretty amazing at this price point."
1,My wife loves it plays games with her all the time and shows it of
1,Bought for my 14 year old and she loves it. Reads books on in all the time
1,I will buy another one. Very convenient and portable.
1,This is great! Wish I had more instructions on what she can do
1,I like Alexa device. I am using this since one month.This is future of communication.
1,"Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity."
1,Fabulous new functionality love the night reading capabilities
1,Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.
1,The parent said she loved the tablet but her son loves it more. He sleeps with it to keep his siblings from touching it. Best gift ever!!!!
1,I got this for my 7 year old daughter. Serves its purpose. It's easy to use and for the price you can't get anything better.
1,"Perfect technology for my 11 year old son for games, reading, and homework."
1,This item is great got for my sister as a birthday gift. She uses it for reading and music
1,Roku is great! I would recommend! You can watch a bunch of Movies.
1,"I 'm very please with the tablet haven't had any problem. It does everything I need it to do. I would recomend it.,"
1,We pay over six $540 a month for Verizon I would never ever pay for cable again all you need is fast Internet I was never the one to sit and watch movies but now since I have the fire stick I love it
1,so much better than my 3 year Fire for versatility.
1,My son loves to play it...........::::........:....
1,"I take my paper white reader every where with me. It fit nicely in my purse. I read all the time, even in the car where the sun is shinning in on it. I just love my paper white and wish I had bought one sooner."
1,"Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it."
0,This tablet works perfectly for my eight old. She loves it.
1,Very easy to use. Very fast & good price. Would recommend this for a beginner
1,Installed the Echo in to my house that we have Nest thermostats in and WeMo light switches its interfaces with those devices are flawlessly. I can ask Echo to turn on or off lights or set the temperature on my thermostats. It does too many things to list. The voice recognition is the best I have used on any product.
1,The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
1,"Not a cheap plug from the check out, this works for my phone and kindle without the nasty reminder that the cord or plug are not strong enough."
1,worth the pennybought for my 2 year old daughter who loves playing the games on the amazon store (a decent collection of free games)+ watch you tube or stored videos.Only prob is that haven't found any cable so that it can stream the videos on TV (have to go for Fire TV stick)
1,Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
1,Had no problem with the instructions available in the system itself. Enjoy the 'easy on the eyes' lighting.
1,"Alexa is awesome!!! She tells jokes, plays my favorite music by requests, sets timers for me."
1,"Easy Setup and easy to use. I get new, weather and traffic before I get out of bed to look for the remote."
1,So much fun and can do tons of things. Great to ask questions and get info. Can even control temperature in the home as well as lights with added products.
1,Alexa is great! I would recommend it to anyone! She answers any question. I ask. I love her for the speaker aspect of things .
1,"OMG! This product is awesome. I never knew my children can be so quiet when they are playing or reading a book on this device. I love it and it makes them not want to play with your phone anymorte bc what thy find on your phone, they can find on this device. Thank you for this.They have learned a lot already and still learning. Recommended it to all my freinds with children already. Great for the price!"
1,"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
1,This is my first kindle. Reading a book always been a pleasure but now is awesome.
1,"we love this Fire Tv, just hard to find shows for now."
1,My original Kindle was no longer working. It was 6 years old and had been used a lot. . I especially like the smaller size of my new Kindle and the backlight.
0,"As an OEM replacement, I suppose its worth a bit more but this price is excessive. A similar product for my Amazon fire was purchased at Walmart for about 3"
1,My granddaughter loves it best thing ever I highly recommend it
1,I a few of them for gifts for Christmas. I love mine and I thought they would enjoy them too.
1,Very helpful product that is fun to use and easy to use
1,The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!
0,I don't like this tablet as Android is not working well
1,We love the parent controls and durability. We would definitely buy another.
1,got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
1,Amazon tablet is great to have. Now I wish I bought more gb.
1,It does what it is suppose to. No problems with it...
1,"Bought for husband's grandmother. Works great for her, she has not called for help after setting it up with her:)"
0,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear"
1,Tablet was purchased on sale and worth it.It holds a good amount of memory. Lots of games can be downloaded.
1,Bought this tablet for our family to use. Does a great job and my son uses it for videos and games and school apps. The parental controls were a little difficult and time consuming to set up but other than that it has been great! I would definately buy again.
1,for an inexpensive tablet it works great. does the basics very well.
1,I love this product it is well worth the money that I paid for it.
1,"Though I was leary of paying that much for a streaming device, it is well worth the price."
1,"Originally purchased the fire TV Stick, upgraded for more bandwith and storage, awesome product."
1,This is a great little android box. Already had one but when I found out it was on sale I bought another. Just sideload kodi onto it and it has everything you need. Wired connection to the internet is a must for streaming HD content.
1,Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
1,I got me the echo and my daughter the dot. The echo is loud but she can be a helpful tool if I need a quick answer to a problem.
1,"Works great! Get all my shows and movies. Even gets my hockey channels. 4K, 1080p, HD, and standard viewing options. So worth it, i bought 2 more!!!"
1,"I am an avid reader, and have purchased both the first and second generations of the Kindle Paperwhite products. Upon reading about the Voyage, I knew I had to have one. Although it's a bit pricey for an e-reader, it's definitely worth it for me. As much as I read, I believe the new screen will result in less eye strain. It's a beauty to look at. Especially when held next to the Paperwhite 2nd gen and compared."
0,My wife bought one at Best Buy. I had to go back and get her $40 dollars when the price went from $179 to $139. I decided I would get her one -- but they were out of stock. I ordered one thru Amazon --- but it still hasnt gotten here.
1,I love the Amazon Echo. This is a great product that simplifies the Automation in home.
1,My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!
1,His product is exactly what we thought it would be. No complaints
1,"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers."
1,I bought this as an exchange Gift for Christmas!!! My Mom fought over it and eventually won it! She Loves It!!!
1,"The longer i have this product the more i use it. My most useful feature is the list capabilities. I just say alexa add "" "" to my shopping list and when i got the the store i'm able to pull everything up. It makes life easier for sure. highly recommend everyone to have one."
1,The white background makes it easier to read a book. The small size makes it easy to take on the go.
1,"This is a nice basic tablet for those not wanting to spend a lot of $$. Easy to use, nice HD resolution for games and even watching Netflix etc."
1,"This is larger than the dot but it provides a nice built-in speaker. I use it in my bedroom, where there are no external receiver/speakers and leave the dot downstairs connected to a larger speaker."
1,Easy to install and worked great - highly recommend
1,It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use.
1,This device is slick looking. Connects to the network easily and if very fast. I does the job really well.
1,Excellent product with decent sound and form factor.
1,So far it works well. I don't use it to control any lights or smart devices as I am in a temporary residence. But it responds well and is clear. It some time comes on by itself.
1,"My kids love it they watch their programs when they want and also we don t have to miss any programs also we can watch them when ever we have time, best purchase I have brought."
0,"I have bought 2 tablets for my son and didn't open it after I received it because it was a birthday gift for them and when they open it on their Big day 1 of the tablet didn't turn on ,the screen is just purple I m out of country right now and will be back on August 4,2107 and I emailed BEST BUY ""Geek Squad "" and told them the whole situation but nobody responded,very disappointed it was a surprise gift for my kiddos and 1 of my son was really upset that tablet won't turn on,let's see if Best Buy read my review and take some action !!!"
1,"I bought it for my son, who really loves to read. He is very happy with it. It has a nice design, screen is very comfortable to look at. And it's lightweight. Perfect for home use and travel."
0,"One of the simplest tablets probably out there, only good for those that want to get into Amazon.com shopping. Good value for bargain proce."
1,"Bought as a Christmas gift, everything seems great."
1,"I bought two of these for my parents while they were visiting. These were an excellent choice as my parents are older. Being able to adjust the font size, the backlit display touch screen all easy to use features. My parents read alot and have said many times now how much they enjoy them."
1,"I love my Amazon Echo and have already purchased a 2nd one for me and 3 more to give as gifts. The sound is great and it's so easy to learn to use. We love the versatility of playing music, setting timers and alarms, giving me the latest sports scores of my favorite teams, and making shopping and To Do lists to share between us."
1,"Most tablets in this price range have the quality to show for it. That is not the case with this unit.While only $50, it feels more sturdy and acts more responsive and capable than other bargain tablets that fit into the same price range.The amazon app store has a lot of great options and the popular apps you would expect from apple or Googles app stores. The only downside is the navigation. Even then, it is only a personal problem as I am used to Google play.All in all, this is a great tablet at an even greater price!"
1,"A present for my wife, she says she really enjoys the larger screen."
1,"I have one myself and I bought 2 more as Christmas gifts while they were on sale. Sometimes Alexa has a hard time giving you the answer. I guess I have to work on how I have to ask to get the correct response. Otherwise, I enjoy Alexa Echo."
1,Does what it's supposed to do. On the spot hands free entertainment system.
1,Great product and like the features of it. It makes carrying a book obsolete.
0,"Santa brought this for my 8 almost 9 year old for Christmas. Santa would have rather brought her an Apple but cost for one is too crazy to spend on one child so this was a good alternative and she loves it! She mainly uses it for games and YouTube videos. I think the graphics are great for someone her age. Great starter for children,"
1,It is only a USB 5 Watt charger. Had now issues with the actual unit as it produced 4.6 watts on a check load but comparing it to what is available to do the same thing there are cheaper options. So minus one star for over priced and that it doesn't come with a cable
1,We recently purchased this as a gift for charity. We chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and couldn't be more please. It's very easy set up and super user friendly. I would def. recommend this for a child rather than a more expensive product.
1,"This device helped in my decision to cut the cord. Works great, abundant material to watch, especially with prime."
0,I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.
1,Excellent speakers for this price range. Combines Bluetooth playback and streaming services. Alexa voice commands are a very convenient way to navigate and get general information.
1,"This product is amazing.If you are thinking of or are already transitioning to a Smart Home the Echo is a must. It turns the inconvenience of opening different apps to work your home into a one stop station that does it all.Compared to Google Home it currently has more compatible brands, which is really nice because the chances of you buying a product that is not compatible is slim.This product is much better than the Amazon Dot. The Dot is riddled with issues in addition to being less responsive and much more frustrating. I have both in my home, go with the Echo tower."
1,Use my tablet everyday. No problems. Easy to carry
1,"My 15 year daughter love her gift, even when the apps are limited its good for the affordable price."
1,"I spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen; when it comes time for leisure reading, it is nice to have relief from bright light. The paperwhite Kindle provides a very eye-friendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. And there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be. But the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text. Cross-book text searching is a great feature, if you need it, too."
1,I bought this for my granddaughter she will be 2 in a few months and she loves it! Very sturdy and the bumper that it comes with has shown to do what it is intended to do. Would highly recommend this product for kiddos!!
1,Love that you can take this anywhere and hook up to my Bluetooth. Great sound quality.
1,"I didn't know much about the dot/echo but when a friend showed it to me, it seemed like a great gift for my husband who is hard to buy for. It's something you could live without but once you have it, you're so glad you do!"
1,Enjoying being able to see the words on the kindle everywhere. Being able to dim is also a wonderfuI feature
1,"Ha my anticipated my purchase having to wait to purchase it, I read a great deal and it did not disappoint. I love my Echo!"
1,"I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device."
1,The amazon fire is a great value for the money. Lots of functionality for under $50.
1,Best investment ever. No more cable. Glad I decided to get this.
1,"Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice"
1,love the fire tv box. its faster and runs a little better than the firestick. Both are great products. love that you can add 3rd party apps to them for even more movie and tv options.
1,"This is my 2nd unit. I liked the first one that my son gifted me so much, I got this second unit for the downstairs. The fact that it was 50% off form BestBuy didn't hurt either."
1,I love the Amazon Echo. We are having so much fun with it and it was so easy to set up. We're still learning all it can do. I was very satisfied with Best Buy's service and delivery also.
1,I got this as gifts for my kids and other family then even myself. I wish I would have got this tablet along time ago.
1,Easy setup and the Echo voice activated searches is a nice touch. Good set of applications as well.
1,This tablet was purchased for a 10 year old but anyone could benefit from it. Very easy to use. Processing speed is good for a bargain tablet. Battery lasts a long time. Overall a great starter tablet.
0,Son loves it........................................
1,I love so far. processes at decent speed I've been able to do what I need without problems. I only wish all the apps on screen didn't have to be visible. Can't enjoiy a screen saver if its covered with icons
1,Like it except that it wont call people for me when hooked up to bluetooth. Would be nice to be able to call out.
1,Gave this product to my nephews and they love it. Easy to carry and easy to use.
1,"I like my ECHO, she however will talk on her own sometime. Still getying used to it. We mainly use it fir the bluetooth so we can play mudic from Pandora and Youtube."
1,"Easy to set up and easy to use. My only complaint is that even with the 32g scan card, it fills up quickly."
1,The Amazon Echo was recommended by our IT department at work and is easy to use. Alexa is smart and usually right. Highly recommended.
1,"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
1,"It was a gift for 10 year old granddaughter. She is enjoying it very much and can do all she wants (games, music) without any issue."
1,Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.
1,"Lots of fun, but also very useful. Have it connected to my Nest Thermostat and going to connect it to my Casta Wireless switches. The speaker has great bass for its size. Search YouTube videos for tips and tricks. It does more then you think,"
1,"Got this for my 70 year old mother for Christmas. She is intimidated by most tech but wanted easy internet access. Got her the Alexa along with the 8"" kindle. It was very easy to set up and easy to teach her how to use it. The speaker quality is really very good....much better then I expected. Streaming music and basic info requests are very simple. Not sure if this unit will get to all it's capabilities but it's just what we needed to get some tech into mom's house. Only down side is now I think I need one at home too!"
1,Super inexpensive and easy to use. Great for my kids.
1,"All apps I like for free, great video quality for Netflix, easy to order from Amazon site."
1,"This product is really useful, got to use it at a hotel."
0,Ok device for the asking price. Would give as first time user
1,This the best streaming device out there. If your looking for a great and fast streaming device this it it for sure. You can't go wrong with it. Super fast and no buffering
0,"I purchased this item for the home automation integration. Its pretty cool for just saying ""Alexa, turn on my kitchen lights"". Integrates with all the large players in home automation, Wink, Smartthings, Philips Hue, etc. Its also works well as a bluetooth speaker, streaming from your phone or tablet. It also streams Pandora and radio stations via TuneIn.It doesn't do anything useful other than that, besides simple queries about weather, etc."
1,Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids
1,My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
1,"I've had the product for over 6 months now. No problems, great picture even in the sun, great battery life."
1,Bought this on Black Friday and have not looked back! Love it
1,"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
1,I like the kindle. The only thing is there's a little light fluctuation at the bottom of the screen.
1,I got a great deal on this tablet after Thanksgiving. It is for a friend that's not to tech savvy. She will use it to watch movies and read books. It already has all of the apps on it that she will use.
1,Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!
1,Great product easy to use. Having different color choices wonderful.
1,"This is a great amazon tablet for the people whoe just want to use it to read, browse the internet, or play games."
1,"Good value for the price, basic tablet for every day use."
1,Great tablet for young children. Parental locks so you can control what they see. A great deal of educational apps.
1,I have enjoyed becoming familiar with all the services available on my kindle!
1,Great product and would buy again. Awesome for streaming
0,"Functional, but be sure the the USB cable is firmly installed in the base to get a connection."
1,if you are a college student or just want to go and cut off your primary cable to save money go for it. It will have a little getting use to and everything isn't as clear as you would want it to be but it is definitely due able for watching tv shows and movies....
1,This is so affordable and we use it everyday! Our kids use it to watch kid videos on prime and kid apps. We bought a super tough case for it and it has lasted a long time.
1,"Fast, easy, and mobile! Connects through WiFi and directly. Easy to move from one room to another."
1,My grandchildren will love them. Christmas gifts..
1,All w o raked f reat
1,I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
1,"Hats off to Amazon - The Echo I started with - not have 2 Dots too in the home. Music, alarms, to do list, shopping list and just home automation is awesome! I'm in the 22nd Century now!!!!"
1,This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome
1,"I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it."
1,"My daughter always want one, she got this one, she love it."
1,"Love my new Kindle FIRE, & LOVE the reasonable price at Best Buy!!!!!!!"
1,"Best one yet, super speed, great pictures, 4k is awesome!"
1,"I've enjoyed the original Kindle (with keyboard) for many years, and it was finally time to upgrade. The light is great, and I use the page press buttons exclusively. Very happy with the size, weight, and appearance of this product."
1,Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature
1,Bought two of these as gifts they are well worth it. They withstand falls as well which is a plus.
1,This amazon echo is simply amazing and a must have for any person and it pairs we with the harmony remote simply wireless
1,Excellent product. I did extensive research before purchasing my new kindle. This is the third kindle I've had. Only problem with kindle is that their charging port becomes loose and will not charge your kindle.
1,"This was a gift for the wife, we have had kindled since the original and this is just a book lovers dream"
1,"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy."
0,I got it to store all my college books without checking to see if they would even be compatible. They weren't. It's my fault for not checking this. The three star rating is because you can buy a good tablet for less and use the kindle app. Which is what I did. I can now read my books and have a fully functional tablet.
1,"A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better."
1,"I am truly enjoying my Echo. She does way more things than I thought she could do. I love being able to just ask her something and she finds it. Whether it is to play music, find a radio station, or put on the news or whether. My husband is not very savvy with technology, but I have found him using her as well. She is a great companion to have in the house. I am looking forward to learning more about what she can do."
1,I bought several of these tablets for my grandchildren. They love it!
1,Easy to use (and fun too!).Great for math and history questions and perfect for making a shopping list.
1,It perfect gift to my cousin for this thanksgiving. She love it :)
1,Great over the top device. The Alexa integration is a major plus.
1,This tablet is AWESOME for kids. She is 3 years old and has had it since Christmas. It is easy for her to use and play on her own. It has been dropped multiple times and you'd never know it!!
1,"Within the low price range, this tablet is excellent for watching TV, movies or reading a book. PROS: very sharp display, fast screen response, fair speaker, low price.CONS: need adding memory in form of micro-sd cards and becoming an Amazon Prime member to make this tablet worthwhile."
1,Easy to use. Lightweight and just right for a child. Screen provides great pics and connects easily to internet. Great buy!
1,This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one
1,"So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books."
1,Great little device to save money. Streams live and on demand TV. Great way to save money on TV subscriptions
0,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
1,Great tablet for a great price. Timely & free shipping
0,I did not use this product I gave it as a present.
1,My wife just opened this for Christmas. She is enjoying it so far. Looks and operates as good as any we have seen recently. So far so good.
1,Easy to get started. Great variety of apps. Price very attractive..
1,"We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile."
1,I've always been a Roku user but when Directv Now came out recently and wasn't available on Roku but was on Fire TV I gave it a try. I've been very happy with it and have switched all my Roku's out with Fire TV's.
1,We have been looking into buying it for kids for some time and they love it
1,It's has all of the best services and now with Alexa and 4K it's even better
1,i really enjoy this product the costumer service was great on helping me pick the right item and explain it to me well i cont to have great experience at best buy.
1,This is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing games.
1,"I just love my echo, I have taught her a ton of new tricks."
1,My daughter loves it. Its is a very good tablet for her
0,This item is no good... will only last for 3 months & amazon basically tells you to f*** off
1,For the price even without the Black Friday price of $35 this is a solid tablet. The new UI for Amazon tablets is much better and it runs smooth. Apps are butter and there is no lag in navigation of the home screen or between apps. I bought this for my little sisters ages 5 & 7 and my parents love the parental controls limiting play time on the tablet. The full experience comes only if you have Amazon prime which is also highly recommended
1,"I have had a kindle for years. After my husbands was stolen we had to get another. The setup is easy, getting books couldn't be any easier, I even get free books through my library which download through Amazon. Would be lost without my Kindle."
1,"Can use it for facebook, or email and of course to read my books in a series. Love it."
1,"Bought it for my mother. Relatively user friendly for someone not too familiar with smart phones and such. She seems to like it although she complains about the speed and size of the screen at times. She also likes the size though since it can easily fit in a medium to large purse. The touch screen is responsive and it has the essentials that she needs. It feels and looks nice. The App Store is ok for simple use. It's a great price for a simple, beginner, or kids tablet. I would probably purchase something more powerful for my own use."
1,"Still learning all that the Amazon Echo can do. Keeps my calendar, my to do list, and entertains me. She helps with my budget with You Need a Budget and much more with all the available apps.Love the Amazon Echo. Can't wait to find out all she can do."
1,I am extremely satisfied with this tablet for the price I paid. It was inexpensive and it works wonderfully. I recommended it to my sister who also purchased one.
1,We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
1,Alexis had to learn news skills before it was useful. Getting better
1,Nice unit - easy to setup and initialize. I like the availability of the secure digital memory card - can put my music and movies on the card and not take up the internal memory.
1,Now I can use my Kindle. Works great
1,We got 2 kindle fires for our girls and we love them :) great purchase.
1,I take this with me when I don't want to carry heavy books. White background much easier to read than original gray.
1,Works great was a gift for daughter she loves it!!
1,Very useful and helpful techs at Best Buy. Cost was average
0,The fire tv does not display in 4k.. it processes in 4k but cant display 4k.. This is because of the dumb design.. It still has a 1.14 HDMI port.. you need at least a 2.0 dvd port to receive a 4k signal.. You wont be able to tell until you hit your tv display resolution.. there you will see it still displaying in 1080p.
1,"At first I thought it would be just another one of the voice interfaces that are on a lot of devices - It only comes with a few functions. Wow I never was so happy to be proved wrong. The omni-directional microphones and excellent sound alone make it a great choice to add to your home. Because of its open source code you can add skills that other users have developed or download a SDK and make your own. It reads me bedtime stories filters my content for news sources according to my whim add complex sums, spells and is an all around good sport. But the best thing is -- I had a few remote control hubs around wink, nest the house because I hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than completing the task myself. Echo changed all that it unified my security, locks, my lights and more through an easy voice interface -- I could not be more happy - it gave me more than a smart house - it gave me a smart home. I even bought a second unit to take on vacation- Definitely will change your life for the better"
1,I has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet
1,I got this for my niece. She loves it! I am happy she is enjoying it!
1,Completely satisfied. Works as it should.
1,Amazon echo is a really cool device to have around the house especially if you have a smart home
1,Very happy that I can finally view HDR content on Amazon and Netflix with this. Only gripe I have is navigating thru this software is a little confusing. Not too bad though.
0,Better price point than apple TV but in comparison for what I am interested in prefer Apple TV
1,Still learning how to get the most out of my new Echo but so far it is fun and very useful and informative.
1,"I bought for the wife, she's still using her old one. don't know why"
1,I bought several of the Amazon Tablets as gifts and my family and friends were ecstatic! I have not given a gift with such great reception in a while.
1,Functions as expected
1,I bought this for e-reading. Easy to use. easy access to Amazon for books.
1,"does everything i need plenty of apps to download along with books and movies, with Prime, great bonus"
1,"best bang for the buck out there,works fast, easy on the wallet, just an all around easy to understand and operate product."
1,This kindle is perfect for using on my commute. It is extremely lightweight and easy to use and it fits just about in any of my bags.
1,"Everytime I give one of these as a gift, it is worth so much more than the $40 I paid for it. Durable and lasts a really long time. Great for kids."
1,"This product was a great one, and the tablet does everything I wanted it to. Some of the websites I go to don't open but other than that it is great I love it."
1,Echo works great and she is much funnier then Siri for sure and they are expanding her capacity all the time. Well worth the money
1,Our household enjoys this fun gadget. I recommend this.
1,Very good tablet for only $30. My wife uses for apps such as Pinterest and Facebook and she loves it.
1,but the skills could use a bit of a refresh. can't remember all the commands as skills require certain keywords. the whole point of amazon echo is to be able to say anything.still fun and great if you have a lot of home automation gadgets.
1,I would definitely recommend this for everyone. It is awesome.
1,Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful
1,Kids love playing games on the tablet - fast for an inexpensive tablet.
1,I've been streaming Wi-Fi for a long time this is my 4th device. It is easily the best so far. It is very easy to use and set up and there is a ton of information you can use on You tube. After several ventures on line and down-loads I'm almost reagy to get rid of cable. In a few months I should have saved enough to go to Best Buy and get a new TV.
1,This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids
1,Had the firetv stick and wanted something a little more powerful that also had the capability of playing 4k content. Much smoother experience overall with the firetv.
1,Excellent Product . Easy set up and has endless possibilities. Great product for all ages.
0,"I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter, and she can't put it down!"
1,"Great shows, fabulous quality, highly recommended, good price."
1,Great tablet for kids but you have to keep your eye on them to protect them
0,This is honestly a little expensive. And I can find other ways to charge my devices.
1,"The whole family is using it. Music, Bluetooth speaker, questions, game times, sports scores. Love the portability."
1,"I purchased the Fire TV box over the Fire Stick because the box supports 4K video. There isn't a lot out there yet, but I've been able to watch 4k programming from Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm using the Netflix, Hulu and FXNow apps -- Amazon Prime is built in. I also downloaded the free VLC app to stream video from my computer. I may end up getting a second one for another TV. Very happy with the Fire Box."
1,This is really the standard when it comes to ereaders. Super light weight and crystal clear.
1,"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
0,I started out liking the tablet but having to change a lot of the settings. It works good but I really did not like the advertisements that were appearing.
1,"If your a prime member this is a must have. It does a great job streaming all of your prime media and your personal media. It does a great job with Netflix too, so if your an Amazon fan this is the box for you."
1,"Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
1,I have loved my echo this far. Alexa has so many skills that are super helpful. I do love the mute option too because sometimes shes picks up when Alexa commercials come on so I can just mute her.
1,This is the BEST tablet for the money anywhere on the planet!!
1,Great tablet for the money. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or Hulu movies and read books on Hoopla. The picture is great and suits my needs. The sound is not the best but its okay.
1,"It's a nice fast table with upgradable memory. App store provided by amazon is ok limited good apps. It's not google or IOS store but still ok. Screen resolution is great in HD streaming work really well. I recommend this tablet because it is also easy to hold, very thin and light."
1,Very good speakers. Gets synced quickly and provides weather updates as well
1,"Believe it or not, I purchased this for my 3 year old Grandson, and he is doing real fine with it."
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo to use in the house and I haven't been disappointed. It plays music, gives me weather and answers most questions. My family has found it very handy to have around."
1,"I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted."
1,This does everything i need and want it to do. All extras in one place.
1,Received the echo dot last year and bought this as well. Love it!
0,Needs more apps and has bugs that need fixing.....
1,"I especially loved the bumper that protects it! He absolutely loved this gift! It has parental control. It has the ability to buy games that are educational for him; and we are all thrilled with it....myself, his parents and our little guy!!!!"
1,"Fire Tv is the best stream box in the market, it's really easy to setup and if you are a prime member you'll love it"
1,Easy to use tablet. Battery life is good. No issues so far
1,I bought four of these for my children to replace the RCA tablets that no longer worked. They load much faster and the battery last longer on a single charge. The are very durable and worth the money!
1,"Wish it would have more access to more info and after paying so much for device, we got more services for free. Seems very expensive to purchase device and have to pay per month to get music, books and etc."
1,This is a great little tablet even with all the ads. Should have paid the extra money to not have the ads but still a great buy
1,"I purchased this for my daughter in the car. I didn't think I would like kids mode, but I hands found it to be useful. Amazon tweaked android and not for the better but it is still manageable. All things considered this is a cheap tablet but for a kid who cares."
1,Im still not sure why this doesn't come with the Kindle - and Im glad I threw it in the shopping cart when I purchased my Kindle.
1,I also have a fire and like it's overall performance.
1,This is a replacement machine. Good reading experience. Great for travel - and reading in bed.
1,Kindle Voyage is absolutely the best! Easy to read in sunlight!Ordered from Best Buy and it shipped immediately!
1,Absolutely the best purchase I have made this year.
0,Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
1,I purchased this as a gift for my parents. It's easy for them to maneuver.
1,Already lost the cord. It should be longer so u don't forget it. Especially on vacation.
1,"I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!"
1,Like talking to a human! Can find an answer for most subjects as long as the internet is available. Fairly accurate also.
1,I need tablets that were cheap but had the processing speed that I needed to run certain apps. My children actually use them (I bought two because they were so cheap) and I have yet to have any problems. I love the individual profiles... Initally I didn't have any parental setting on there but my son quickly started purchasing books and such that he liked with my money.... Hence the individual profiles and limited access and a password on my profile. I'd recommend this product because of the price and functionality of the product. I love it and my kids do too.
1,Great product I was excited to get it. I encouraged others to purchase one.
1,Bought for my three kids and so far there are no complaints. Easy to use!
1,Great to group all your program app into one device.
1,Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
1,Not bad for an entry level consumer. Decent for kids (with a bumper) and adults that aren't super tech savvy.
0,"I bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. There are several apps I'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the Facebook app so I wind up using my phone for many things that I used to do on my tablet. If it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but I do read on it a lot, so I'm keeping it but I would still like a new tablet - which is disappointing."
1,The item is great also great for kids for the price you can't beat it.
1,Great purchase. Easy to operate and smooth transaction.
1,"My 86-year-old aunt has an Echo and she recommended that I get one. I enjoy the information, entertainment, and help it is able to provide."
1,Bought this for my daughters elderly friend across the street. She loves it.
1,Needed for a friend that is blind and it is great for audible books.
1,Excellent product I would recommend to anyone. Very happy
1,Purchases as a gift for my niece in the Caribbean. As soon as I gave it to them they hooked it up ti the wifi and was ready to go. They enjoyed every minute of it
1,"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters."
1,Purchased this for Christmas for my daughter. Its small size allows it to be easily carried around and handled and she will enjoy reading kindle books on it.
1,You get a multitasking tablet for an incredible price!
1,Great $50 tablet that I don't have to worry about kids breaking. Easy to use (if you can operate an Ipad you can use this)
1,"This camera is a little thicker than other ""pocket"" cameras, primarily due to the fold-out LCD screen. The screen is a nice feature as it provides additional stability when in the ""out"" position. The zoom capability and image stabilization features are also very good."
1,Bought this item for my son because the last one needed replacing. Easy to use to read books and do internet searches.
1,We bought this for our 7 year old daughter and it is perfect!!
0,"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it."
1,Works great. Having a physical internet connection works great for streaming
1,"good low light readability, battery life is fantastic. It's all i could ask for at such a low cost"
1,"I bought this tablet for my 6 year old son. The tablet has a nice screen resolution, stay charged for a long period of time and carries a lot of free apps. For the price you are definitely getting more than what you are paying for. I have purchased this item for all 3 of my kids they never complain about the tablet not working or freezing."
1,Very easy to use. Many various apps available. Great for reading and games. I would highly recommend it as a very easy use tablet for beginners and children.
1,Small and useful has an expandable memory. Very user friendly !
1,You find may uses for Echonfrom news flash to adding appointments to you calendar.
1,Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages
0,"I got this tablet for my 20 month old son. He constantly wants my phone or iPad to watch YouTube kids videos. He can work both of these apple devices all on his own. I figured he was ready for his own tablet, hoping he'd leave mine alone. No luck. The Fire is not as user-friendly as my iPhone. Even on the child setting it is not easy to use. The surface is not as responsive to touch. He gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying. Now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my iPad and phone. If you want a tablet for your toddler, just get an iPad."
1,Not as quick as my iPad but a great solution for traveling. Some of the apps that you get on an iPad are unavailable. Happy purchaser!
1,This is a great product. It still needs better AI to make it more user friendly. I also have a Google Home. They each have their own strong points.
1,Love this product. Very fast and no buffering lag.
1,I like it because it easy to use and easy to install
1,Great reader for the price. Good battery life. A little smaller than I expected but is well built.
0,"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults."
1,Waited quite a while before buying this Kindle reaader. Weighed it heavily against an iPad. Talked to friends about their experiences with reeaders. The Kindle just seemed l8ike it would do the job I wanted much betterand the price was fantastic. I have beeen pleasantly surprised with what a Kindle can accomplish and how easy it is to use.
1,Set up really easy. We cancelled cable right away. Still figuring out which apps are for us. Got antenna for local channels.
1,"The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. I also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles."
1,The sound is amazing and it lives up to all the hype.
1,"is simple and easy to use, also is perfect size for my purse or a carry on bag"
1,"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
1,Love it! Best e reader I have owned so far and I've owned quite a few
1,Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
1,It has everything I need and the size makes it easy to read.
1,Very fast response to the different apps and looks great with my 4K tv
1,bought this for my wife for mothers day to replace another tablet that was tough to use as a reader outdoors. Battery last a long time which is good on long road trips.
1,"Good box, but menu slow when booting up and control loses sync at times."
1,Hate using cable very easy to use. Family is enjoying using it.
1,"They love it, works like it should without too many issues"
1,If you have Amazon Prime I would Recommend. . It is equally build and quality is good. Interface is nice and easy. Games not so good.
1,"It was so easy to setup and to use, I would buy this for a gift"
1,"My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his"
0,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
1,"The Amazon Echo is the first smart home purchase we've made. So far she's been quite a bit of fun. She's not so smart all the time, we tend to ""Alexa, Wikipedia ...."" we love listening to Audible books, and prime music. I have my Google Calendar synced and she tells me upcoming engagements. She understands very well for the most part, as expected she doesn't always understand what our 5 year old says. Amazon is constantly updating what she can do. We'll eventually get more smart home items, (light bulbs, thermostat, etc) . So far she's been fun to have around."
1,My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.
1,I've use the Amazon fire tv and the Roku. The Amazon fire box In my opinion is easier to use and I prefer the Amazon remote over the Roku. The only problem I've had with Amazon fire would be the life of the batteries in the remote.
1,"Easy to use, lots of apps. So far have really enjoyed!"
1,It works great for all my needs to check my emails
1,Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.
1,This Echo is very cool. Great sound and ease of use makes this a great buy!
1,For $50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. I had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. The only minus is amazon prime is now $99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. But still overall a great deal.
1,"I love that the Echo responds well to anything I say. Weather, traffic, sports are all easy to ask for. I can't wait to begin hooking up my lights and other home electronics to it."
1,"Great speaker, great sound quality, gets super loud. Alexa is helpful and can really do a lot. Highly recommend toanyone"
1,Perfect item for our autistic grandson. He absolutely loves it.
0,"Pros: The E-Ink display is easy on the eyes, very sharp. Great battery life.Cons: Dependant on Amazon's Infrastructure to manage. Because of that limitation I give it 3 stars."
1,"Love, love, love it! I check all news, weather forecast, listen to music, listen to newspaper/ magazine reviews, buy stuff etc. How did I live without Alexa /Echo?"
1,This is my 2nd. kindle and wouldn't go without one for any length of time.Great to bring along on a trip and easy for anyone to use.
1,This product works very well and the price is reasonable.
1,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
1,Really enjoying this little guy bought two for my mom and daughter
1,my daughter loves her tablet she got it for christmas and has lots of fun with her own games
1,I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it
1,The Echo works very well for the music lover and children that like to ask it questions. I tried it out for a few weeks and I decided it wasn't for me. I seldom listen to music unless I'm in my car. It was too much money to just sit there idle. It is a great product for the right person and it has a lot of potential.
1,Easy to carry all your books in one place. You will never get distracted when using kindle.
1,I was satisfied with tablet and size and clarity!!
1,Great beginner tablet. Used for my kid to view videos.
1,Everything you could ever need at the sound of your voice. So easy to set up.
1,"Great to set timers, play music, look up scores, etc. I wish it could access my weather app (dark sky) when I asked about rain to give me a more precise answer."
1,Great product. It was on sale and I didn't think it was going to be great but it was
1,A little faster than the firestick and has 4k. Can only do 4k at 30hz and 4k is not in the menu screens. (Can be a little confusing when thinking the device is entirely 4k when you turn it on and your tv says it's only 1080p and you have 4k enabled on a 4k tv.
1,I love my Echo. You can ask it most everything and get an answer. Plays music with great sound!
1,i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd
1,I started with the original kindle- loved it but light was bright on the cover for night reading. Then got the fire as a gift and love that but reads more like on a tablet.. Broke down and bought the latest paperweight to read at night- great light to dim for night reading. Very light too!
1,"This tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. It does what I need and I got it at a great price!"
1,I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE
1,It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
1,excelent costumer service i love the store you will find everything
1,"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!"
1,"Great e-reader, has a built in back light for reading in low light and in the dark."
1,It's good for reading books. It's great for playing games. Yeah.
1,Bought four of these for our grand children and they love them. Great price too.
1,"i got one for my mom she's 90 years young and she sits and listens to it all day, she;s got the amazon tap i got my draugther the dot and i got my self another tap. i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better. my grand kids love playing ganes with alexa. like i said every household need one"
1,"I ""upgraded"" from my Kindle Fire to the Paperwhite! I couldn't be happier with my decision."
1,I had a tablet that was stolen and I was happy to replace it with this one it is just as nice and easy to use!
1,"All my grand kids have one is the best entertainment for all my 7 grad kids, from 5 to 19 years old. I love this product."
1,Works fine and I am pleased with my purchase. I would purchase again.
1,Purchased fire stick along with fire tv and tv works better
1,"Yes, it's that much fun to use and you'll wonder how you functioned in life without the Echo of Amazon?"
1,I got it on black friday. Its a great tablet for Kids or your additional backup tablet for games or reading books. Ad's on the lock screen was annoying.
1,This was a gift and we are still learning all it can do.
1,Works smooth and easy will recommend to friends and family
0,"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
1,I bought the Fire as a gift for a friend who loves to play games. This is the perfect size and functions well for his purpose and more. This is a great tablet for the price!
1,Saves my phone battery ever since I'm using my Alexa.
1,the tablet is just the right size for our granddaughter. she loves it. she can play her little games and has so much fun with it.
1,Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
1,Good to get additional accessories on Thanks giving...
1,This is a great tablet! My nephews really enjoy using it.
1,Really like the touch screen factor. Really lights up easy to read especially since you can enlarge the font
1,Purchased for an 8 year old grand daughter who loves to read. She loves this tablet and is reading and playing her games everywhere the family travels. She loves the device and the pink color; I loved the price and the fast delivery .
1,I bought 3 for our 3 oldest Grandkids ages 7 to 10 and they loved them! Very easy for them to set up themselves and get started using them with very little help from thier parents. Great product for the price.
1,"My wife's laptop bit the dust and I needed a low-cost solution so she could read her email and surf the net. This device does the job. I was impressed with the quality for $50. I have no complaints. Cheap, easy to use and keeps the wife happy. Good deal!"
1,Alexa is so much better than Siri. More natural and faster.
1,"I PURCHASED TWO FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHARE AND THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEM, WHICH MAKES ME REALLY HAPPY! I NEED TO BUY HEAD PHONES NEXT!"
1,I love that even great quality product like this is available to masses who can actually afford them. The table does it job really good. And i'm happy with my purchase.
0,"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature."
1,Works just like it says it does. Would recomend this to anybody!
1,amazon fire tv box is awesome i love using netflix in 4k!
1,"My 4k tv has an android Amazon app., but it does not include all the features that the box has. The up-scaling of 1080p to 4k is incredible!"
1,"Got this as an early Christmas present. The sound it pretty good for a small speaker. We now have Echo controlling the lights, furnace and the A/V system. Set up is easy."
1,I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.
1,"I like the product. It works great. It is just what we were looking for. However, we had to sign up for the Amazon prime membership just to set up the account to actually use the product. We were not prepared for that."
0,"The Fire itself works well so far, the ouch comes from the fact that the buyers Amazon account MUST be hitched to it to download free games. Who wants kids downloading anything that has your credit card attached even if it's free or accessing your account?"
1,I have a couple kindles so got this one for my mom to replace a tablet I had got her last year. I didn't realize it was smaller than mine but that was my own fault. Works as expected!!
1,This is a great option for a first tablet. It's lightweight and user friendly.
1,Loved it. Perfect type of lighting and so lightweight!
1,"Overall I like the fire TV.The UI could be a better,it could be better organized and easier to navigate.It also pushes Amazon video over other streaming services.Doesn't have as many streaming services as Roku."
0,"This certainly isn't the most impressive device out there, but at $40 it is a fantastic value."
1,"My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it."
1,"Lots of Fun!! Useful for New, Weather and Alarms - Great Speakfor for the size - Easy to Set up"
1,"This is a great device for streaming content to your TV. If you have an Amazon Prime account, definitely a must buy. Worth the extra money over the Fire Stick."
1,I received this as a Christmas present. This is great to take on a trip or to work. It is great for watching movies or reading books. It was easy to setup.
1,"Incredible knowledge Alexa has, sports, weather, trivia, simply amazing! Need to hook up my music to it!"
1,bought it to an alternative to the apple tv works amazing and best of all it was on the cheap
1,Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
1,This is my second tablet and it's a great starter tablet. If you have a prime account it's even better. The Prime video allows you to download videos for later viewing.
1,Thus device is so portable and works really well for what I want it to.
1,Provides television options without the cost of cable. Easy to setup and use.
1,"Works good but, you can purchase a charger with same or better specs. on Amazon MUCH cheaper. I purchased a 5 port 30 watt charger for about 1/2 of the cost of this."
1,"The Kindle was bought for my nine year old grandson for Christmas. He wanted something to play games on and watch You Tube. Works great, no issues. Would recommend for any age, great price too!"
1,Setup was very simple. I can actually hide it behind TV and still use remote. I was surprised how fast it boots up. Makes my TV a smart TV that allows many more apps than the ones that come built in generally.
0,Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
1,Easy to set up Plays movies from Amazon Prime with no problem Great tablet for the price
1,"I have owned exactlo, nooks, kobo's and kindles. This is the Cadillac of readers!!!"
1,Purchased as a birthday present for my brother and was an upgrade for a previous model. I did not use is but he loves it.
1,Perfect for my 8 year old nephew. He absolutely loves it and uses it everyday!
1,"I bought the 7"" Amazon fire tablet for my 3 year daughter to view learning programs and videos. I love it because you can have up to 5 children and 2 adults sign up And create the parental controls level for each of them"
1,"This is my 2nd Kindle for myself, I bought the 1st one for my wife a week ago, we both love it, most important it wont hurt our eyes and battery last for weeks without charging it"
1,"Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break."
1,"Very good replacement for books. Small, lightweight, and easy to tote around with you. The paperwhite version has a sharper screen then the regular. Thank you Best Buy for a pleasant transaction."
1,I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy.
1,"The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away."
1,The box needs a 4k tv for maximal viewing pleasure. Will not turn your tv into a 4 k machine. Sure will help a little with graphics. If that where the case people would buy cheaper tvs then this box. And it is much faster than original. I have box for different rooms.
1,"This is just a basic kindle fire for my 7 yr old child. It works fine for her. It obviously doesn't have comparable picture quality when compared to the HDX versions, but it still has the same functions. It does have a rear and forward facing camera, making it easy to take pictures of the dog. There are lots of safety features and apps for kids also."
1,Thumbs up. This was a good substitute to replace the current cable provider you use. Canadian customers would like this the best.
1,"my grandson really loves it, is reading a lot of books already."
1,"I found this product let me let go of cable tv and saved me tons of money, since I am on limited income i had to let cable go I kept my High speed internet and use my Fire to watch movies and save Tons of money."
1,"It's very light, comfortable to handle and very responsive."
1,I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!
1,I really love both Amazon tv and Apple TV as products. I do wish Amazon tv has a simplified AirPlay ability for iOS. I'm sure with apps you buy and other methods you can accomplish it but if it was just standard like Apple TV AirPlay I would give this product 5 stars. For cheap easy price it makes a great gift. Where it beats Apple TV is 4 k streaming. So if you want 4K get Amazon Fire tv.
1,New Kindle Voyage is a nice upgrade from the basic model. Smaller e reader with a brighter light. So far so good.
1,"Bought this tablet as a gift and so far they are happy with it. I did the set up and I can tell you it didnt lag or freeze so thats always a plus. It runs on the amazon app store. I dont care for it cause it dont have as many apps as others. Other than that and the low memory, I like it. Personally I download alot of game apps so i need lots of memeory but for my mother in law its just fine. She likes to read books on it, she says its good for that. Also she was able to get the libraries app and download free books so thats a plus."
1,"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though."
1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate.
1,"The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,"
1,I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
1,Love my kindle paperwhite. My first one lasted years and I immediately went and bought a new one and that one no longer worked It's great for night reading with the back light
1,MY SO LOVE IT. EXCELENT FOR ENTRETAIMENT. AFFORDABLE PRICE
1,"Replaced first generation Kindle, love improvements!"
1,Love this product. Will not go back to satellite or cable.
1,Easy to install has everything that I need and more!!!!
1,"Very affordable tablet,soft led screen impact on the vision."
1,still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.
1,"This is the second Kindle I have owned. Paperwhite appealed to me for its reader-friendly settings and backlighting. My first Kindle was a keyboard model with no backlight so I used a ""clip in"" light that fit in my M Edge case. I forsook the keyboard this time as I rarely used Kindle for web browsing. I also abandoned my fear of advertising to select the ""special features?"" model. Ads appear only at start up and are quickly and easily dispatched - there's only one ad so all you do is swipe up and it's gone. The new Kindle has exceeded my expectations. After I get books to put on it, I turn off the WiFi and the device will go for weeks without recharging. (Btw, I purchased an inexpensive Fintie case which shuts down Kindle when you close the cover and sends it to sleep - it's never really totally off.) You just have to remember to put your reading on the device itself rather than in the ""cloud"". The backlighting is awesome and the Paperwhite e-ink and font great for older eyes. My only complaint is that the ""collections"" setup is not particularly user friendly and the icons take getting used to on the toolbar. However, I am totally happy with this purchase and glad I updated to Paperwhite."
1,I purchased this for my wife her old Kindle fire bite the dust. This unit has better contrast and is easier to use. She loves it.
1,Screen is very vibrant and bright great color. Pretty easy to use even for a beginner. It's big enough to see well but easy to hold. Fits in a purse easily.
1,Has many functions app or voice controlled. Great speaker qualit
1,This an amazing speaker. Absolutely great sound! The capabilities are endless. I would recommend this product to everyone. Very pleased!
1,"The screen is beautiful, great for daylight or night. Very soothing in eyes. Kindle has a huge collection of books. If you love books, you will love kindle"
1,I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It is very easy to operate and it holds plenty of books. It is easy to travel with. I would recommend it to everyone
1,My favorite streaming box. Works flawlessly and am very pleased with the item.
1,This is just what we needed for a you k8d ..the apps are great
1,"I love the size and design. works great, I love that i can change font sizes"
1,I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they
1,So easy to set up and use right away. Dual camera is great.
1,"Its Fast, reliable, what else could you ask for! This Bad boy will knock out the competition and get rid of your cable bill for good! Its time to Cut the cord people because Fire TV is the future of entertainment!"
1,"I bought this to replace my failing Kindle 3 (Keyboard). I absolutely love it! The only con I have found is battery life with airplane mode off. It drains rather quickly with it off, turn airplane mode on and it's great!"
1,"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price."
1,Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.
1,I love being able to use voice activation for anything from playing music to making an Amazon purchase.
1,"I love the size and the Light, to be able to read, anywhere, anytime!"
1,This product is great. Very fast and responsive and allows you to cutomize however you feel.
1,"Small enough to carry every where. When he is using it, you can hear a pin drop."
1,this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover
1,This is not only fun to use but extremely handy to have around the house.
1,My daughter loves it and IRS a good and easy size to travel with too
1,I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
1,The Amazon echo is a wonderful product and I would recommend it to everyone.
1,"Worth the purchase, simple to use and easy to set up"
1,So far it's great. This was a gift. She is gets this on today.
1,"Takes getting use to asking the questions in the right way. Alexa is still learning so at times can be frustrating when asking questions. Great for music, weather, dates, and schedule requests. Its an entertaining companion when your home and enjoying some private time."
1,"Great product clear video stream, very easy to hook up"
1,I bought 5 of these and they are really easy to set up and my kids love them; might order one for myself. Bought them on Black Friday for $33/each...should have bought mine then.
1,"The Amzon Echo is like a dream come true. Everyone in my house feels like we live in some future movie. We use it everyday to get our news, weather, cooking timer, control our lights, control our AC and listen to music over Spotify, all with just our voice. It's useful to get quick wiki info or even just for a joke. The kids love to play paper rock and scissors with her. My only regret is I don't have another!"
1,Great price great product would recommend this gift
1,This is a product that I believe will be very useful.
1,This was purchased for my 7 year old son & he LOVES it!! Perfect sixe for him
1,I purchased this for my mom 4 days before Christmas with 2 day free shipping. It arrived on time with no issues. My mom loves it! She likes to read digital books and watch Netflix and this tablet allows her to do both. She also loves that it's small enough to fit in her purse and Bluetooth capable.
1,"I love the fire sticks but sometimes not crazy about using wifi. The fire tv can be hard wired, which limits some buffering issues. Not that it's ever really been an issue. It's still really easy to use and setup just like the fire stick."
1,I am totally happy with this product for my two year old grandson..he enjoys it when we are all playing on our phones
1,"This is used in a work environment. Our tech support team chose this particular tablet for all of us. We use it for contacts, work trail record keeping, and customer support, and are very pleased with how much we can do with it. I say, excellent choice."
1,"This was such an awesome purchase. I'm constantly asking her to play different music, sending messages, set timers and even use her just as a speaker for my iPad. She even has learned the music I like and makes suggestions. I plan on purchasing the additions for light switches to utilize it even more."
1,Does it job and hope amazon keeps adding more apps
1,I have a four year old daughter who has learned a lot from using this tablet. The child feature is great because she can access everything for her age in one area ( with parental settings of course). I really love this tablet
1,bought for grandkids they love them. wise choice I made
1,does everything i need it to do for my business needs
1,The Echo is amazing and has already changed how we enjoy our home! From asking Alexa to turn on the lights in the morning to looking up the star of the movie that we are watching The Echo is a valuable asset to our family. I am going to purchase the Dot and we just added a Tap to complete our Smarthome.
1,"Take out the box from packaging, connect box, turn on the box and watch Amazing Amazon tv just like that.....any easier and easier or convenient it can not get. Great buy at Best But."
1,This is much better than the echo. The sound is great
1,"Easy to use, good battery life, great back lighting."
1,Easy for my wife to play music she likes by just asking. Works great on Fire Tv. Still hooking up lights and controllers but all has been easy to do.

1,Awesome good size large enough for games and photos
1,Bought online Black Friday to avoid in store hassles. Got an option on colors to keep my 3 boys from confusing tablets.
1,I love this kindle tablet. Its speed is awesome. And its a great device for young children.
1,Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.
1,My daughter loves her tablet it works really good.
1,I bought it for my husband as a birthday gift. It's perfect for his movies.
1,"Whether you're a bookworm or a casual reader, the Kindle Paperwhite is a great way to read and discover new and interesting books. Admittedly, I only read infrequently since purchasing my Kindle. I absolutely love the size and abilities of the Kindle and have been reading 4-5 books per month since purchasing it. Highly recommended!"
1,Bought this as a mothers day gift for mother in law she loves it
1,I always take me tablet when I go to get my hair done. It makes time go by faster when I'm under the hair dryer!!
1,"Alexa tell me a joke, Alexa play some Christian music"
1,I love that I can set time limites for my 5 yr old.
1,Awesome product great value! I can stream from Netflix and Hulu and is much faster than the FireStick.
1,"Awesome.. Everything I need and more. I'm very happy with the tablet.I'm very happy.Thank you,Kathleen Stroyek"
1,I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it.
1,Works just as advertised.Easy to set up.Finds music with ease
1,I highly recommend this to everyone! Easy to use! Fills the room with music.
1,Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient
1,Awesome we buy another one ASAP kelly was super helpful in helping me with all my problems...
1,We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it's held its own so far.
1,Have had it for a couple of weeks and really enjoy being able to call up music and have it play without having to go through my phone.
1,"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift."
1,It is very high quality device. It is easy to set up and very easy to operate. It is a lot of fun.
0,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
1,Best purchase you will ever make. Intall kodi and go cable free
1,"So happy with my purchase easy to setup and request information, music and anything"
1,"First, let me say, that I only took one star away, because even after getting I touch installed, my little girl can turn the unit off or mess with whatever is playing by pushing buttons. Not sure if it would have been worth it to pay the extra fifty for the kids edition. Aside from that one single item, this has been an excellent purchase."
1,Perfect for travel and home. We have 5 in our house and everyone loves them.
1,"Better than expected for the price. Sturdy enough for regular use, fast enough for streaming and fits nicely in the hands or on the lap."
1,Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
1,Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well
1,Meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the Oasis E-Reader.
1,"I was using a Roku box and various game consoles before this for Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming platforms but the Amazon Fire TV really is the best option out there currently. The device is fast and responsive, includes tons of different apps and integrations and best of all has Alexa support for search. If you're a Amazon Prime member especially, this device is a must have."
1,Got this for Christmas gifts for a few people and each say they love this tablet . For the price it's great .
1,My son had the kindle w/o the camera but cracked the screen so we bought the upgrade with the camera. He loves it
0,Even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better. Feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected. Amazon disappointed me with this product. Minor issues in installing the apps which are available in iOS too.
1,"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough."
1,"For a reading device, you cannot do better than Kindle. And, if you're going to get a Kindle, get the Paperwhite as the lights on the screen are worth the extra cost over the base model. You will NOT regret it."
1,"Bought this as a gift for my mother so that she could watch Netflix and hulu while in the hospital. Took her a bit to get used to as she was used to her ipad but overall I like this product. Only drawback is lack of appstore content (namely clash of clans, clash royale, pokemon go, etc)"
1,I love the kindle voyage. My favorite feature is that I can read while at the beach!! It's also very lightweight and fits in one hand.
1,This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!
1,Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
1,Easy to setup and use. Even without peripherals the syste interaction was beneficial
1,Got it for my son and he loves it! Definitely would recommend it!
1,This tablet was purchased for a person in their 20's and they are very content with it.
1,"The Fire TV fills my need for a streaming device. I'm able to access PS Vue, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other channel apps. The remote and interface are intuitive and simple and Alexa is a nice add-on feature. Much recommended for anyone looking for a streaming device."
1,"When I purchased the Tap I thought it was a portable speaker for the echo. It's actually it's own device. Yes, it's portable, can operate wireless.It does work with the same ""alexa"" set up. The Echo operates with no hands…you can simply speak to Alexa. The tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to Alexa. Great sound quality. Rechargeable base unit."
1,"If you need help making a decision in what product to buy then hope I can quickly help you make that decision. This is a great product for 90% of us out there. If you have a 4K TV then get the 2016 version of the Fire TV. If you have to decide between a Firestick or a Fire TV then get the Fire TV. The processor speed difference alone is worth the price difference. If you want the best out there then the Nvidia Shield TV is for you. Either way, Amazon made a great product in the Fire TV. Some key features are the microSD expansion, ability to use a controller for some mild gaming, and voice activated remote. Get Prime and have access to all of Amazon's video and music streamin service.."
1,Love it very much thanks. I use my table for banking
1,I am not a tv person but I like the movies and tv content. I love pureflix
1,"The Amazon Echo has become a critical appliance in our kitchen. Admittedly we bought the Echo to serve as yet another cool toy to have around...but we're finding that it's a great addition to our lives.The top used function for our family is probably the simple to use timer function, but a close second is the ability to call on any artist we want to hear with Amazon Prime Music. It's well worth a few bucks a month to get the music service and the sound quality of the device (although not audiophile worthy) is quite good.Our family is still exploring the many great tools available with Alexa...but I can say without reservation that it's a great device to have for any household."
1,"I had wanted one of these, the price was right so I bought 2 one for me and one for a gift for someone else. I really enjoy it."
1,"Very functional device, takes some time making Alexa smarter. Unfortunately it needs to be powered by a wall adapter so you can't take it from room to room..."
1,It was a gift to our granddaughter for Christmas and she was and is thrilledwith the device. She especially will use the Geek Squad information service.
1,This is my 4th Kindle. I love that it can be used in any light... even no light at all. It is small and easy to carry around. Still has all the best features of all the others before it.
1,My grandson loves it. He said his games don't freeze up on this one.
1,"This was a gift to my husband. It's the only e-reader that can be read in sunlight and since we were going to Hawaii, I thought it'd be nice for him not to have to lug along a bunch of books (I already had my Kindle)."
1,It work just as good as the tablets that cost much more. If you take care of it it will last a long time.
1,"Better than the firestick, works well with prime and simple to use."
1,"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
0,Touch is not good. Also very limited apps on amazon app store.
1,bought this unit as a door price at work . my fellow employees went bananas when they seen this as a prize option. last x- mas I gave away the fire stick and that was a big hit
1,Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
1,"Awesome little tablet. It isn't the fastest, but it gets the job done. Bought one for my father and one for myself. He uses it to watch DIY videos on YouTube and online browsing. I do the same and also listen to my Spotify playlists. It's pretty cheap too!"
1,Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
1,It performs with no major problems and without excessive load times
1,Purchased for my mother so she would have something bigger to look at besides her phone. It works wonderful.
0,"I am on my 3rd Kindle. This software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage. Only about a fifth of the available space. So this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small. The new books should be downloaded to my Library in List Form as in the original Kindle. In addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category. Finally, this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want. This OS is definitely NOT USER FRIENDLY. It requires a great deal of effort of the user. A lot of wasted data space and waste of time. I am requesting a return to the original Kindle OS."
1,"This thing is awesome, I had a firestick and then I upgraded to the FireTV and it is much faster and much smoother. It is a 2015 model and I am not sure if it will be upgraded in the near future but it is pretty decent in 2017. Also much easier and user friendly than the Apple TV also cheaper,"
1,"Alexa can answer most questions, play music from your library, and even order items you have run out of. This ""toy"" is a lot of fun! I recommend it - I haven't had it very long but so far so good - thumbs up for Alexa!"
1,Great tablet. Phenomenal value for the money. I've bought one for everyone in my family.
1,Easy to navigate and my son just loves it pkus a year free of service.
1,It's exactly what it says it is. Really happy with it.
1,A very handy device to have with you when you're on a budget and an active Amazon member. Works wonders as a Prime Member!
1,Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable
1,Got this Amazon Echo because it was half off the regular price. It was a fun surprise gift for my family.
1,Throw it in the backseat for long car rides and you're golden
1,Works Great. My 3rd Kindle. Only complaint...they break
1,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
1,Finally I can read at the beach and it's super light!
1,"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews."
1,I bought this Kindle for myself last year and it's the best $50 I've spent! I hoped that my sister would enjoy one.
1,The Kindle fire was a xmas present for my son in law and he just loves it.
1,I bought this for my son for Christmas and its perfect. My son gets to play his games with easy access to Amazon prime content.
1,I Love It Works Great.Tried To Purchase This Kindle Fire At Christmas Time It Was Sold Out. But I Keep Going Back To Best Buy And Finally They Were In Stock So I Bought One And Now I'm Happy......
1,Very nice screen resolution. Easy to read in both sun and in the dark.
1,I love the picture quality from this device. Can't go wrong with a 4k . Also the picture steaming on the TV screen amazing. Good job amazon.
1,My daughter is 6 and she plays with everyday and my son had one last year good quality
1,"You can download free apps, take good pics and the resolution looks great!"
1,Bought it as a present for my wife. She is very pleased with her reader.
1,"Alexa is great , is a great house hold tool around the house , timers alarm , sleep machine everything u need"
0,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions
1,Started with fire sticks as I thought cheaper was better option then I got to see one of these in action. So much faster.. definitely would recommend.
1,Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item.
1,"This is my first piece of streaming equipment, and it was simple to set up and use. The remote control is convenient, and it has voice control. This apparatus makes streaming movies from Amazon Prime super easy."
1,"I picked up the Fire TV because I already owned 3 Fire Sticks and was happy with them. I wanted a unit that I was familiar with and I""m glad I bought this one. I don't really use Alexa so that didn't play a part in the purchase. However, you really see the dual core processing power when you start apps. It's a good bit faster than the Fire Sticks with the same ease of use. As an added bonus, you can install and play games. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
1,"I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch"
1,First Ereader ever bought and it has been one of the best purchases ever. Have had no problems with it and it genuinely feel like you're reading a paperback book. 10 out of 10 would recommend
1,"We purchased a couple Amazon Firesticks first to facilitate cutting the cord. The Firesticks are ok for bedrooms or less used TVs, they just don't perform as well as the more powerful Amazon TV Box. I will be purchasing another one for the movie room. It's been great cutting the cord. But the one thing I'm waiting in is for Hulu Live to make it over to the Amazon platform. They keep saying soon, so patiently waiting. Hulu Live looks to be much better than our current Sling service. Other than that the box is great and that one issue might be Hulu or networks holding it up."
1,"My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too."
1,"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps."
1,works good
1,This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable
1,Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.
1,This item is great if you have prime. I really enjoy it. I even bought my parents one. If you don't have prime. Get the Google home.
0,I bought this to use with a particular app but wasn't able to install them so I returned the tablets.
1,Never thought this would be as useful as it is. Just ask Alexa to play a song and it will.
1,"I use Amazon Echo for the weather, timer, music, news, and am learning more and more uses for her. I am happy with this product."
1,I love my Echo! it is easy to use and I also use it to turn on the lights in my house. I works great!
1,My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
1,I am enjoying using the new and growing features of Alexa. I wish that it wouldn't suddenly turn on for no reason (even in a quiet room). It seems like it's monitoring me. Uncomfortable.
1,Not sure about having a bot monitor my household. 1984 has come to fruition.
1,"What made this even better was the Black Friday prices on the Kindle Fires. At $35.00, if they get broken, it's not as big of a deal. I remember buying one of these when they came out and it was a whole lot more than it is now. That's technology for you, I guess. Great buy. Great product."
1,Is exactly what I was hoping for. Easy to use. Absolutely perfect product.
1,I am using Alexa for my thermostats. It feels so good I can change my thermostats while I am in bed. I'll continue to use Alexa for other things. With my voice I can do anything with Alexa.
1,Great clarity for a tablet of this price point. Amazon provides a great operating system making it easy to maneuver and web surf. The only thing lacking is the camera not making it good for skyping or taking pictures in poor light. However given the dollar per value you can't beat it. Attractive looks good fit and finish makes it stand out in a sea of choices!
1,Amazon Fire TV Brings pretty much every streaming app all under one easy-to-use interface.
1,Works whenever I want...learns my speech patterns and I can use it listen to music whenever I want
1,I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
1,"Its a little expensive but is a good Product, I will recommend this one over the Amazon TV stick"
1,"I cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick, and liking it. It's a great product, and with my amazon prime membership, gives us lots of viewing options, especially for the kids who don't mind not seeing the latest episode of their shows (we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service, which is available on the fire tv). The kids also enjoy all the games on it. The only issue is that many of the games that the kids want to play require a separate controller, which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one."
1,I now have access to music in my bedroom. I love it!
1,"Great tablet for simple reading, web surfing without too many features"
1,My few family members bought at least one or two as gift. All the kids seem to enjoy
1,Fire box is the way to go. Speed rules and this is in the top of the class.
0,"My grandchildren love this. Its the perfit size for them and ot allows them to do all the things they want. The price was also great, much less than a large tablet."
1,The fire tv box streams really well and might just be better than my Roku 3.
1,kid proof! bought for my grand babies and they love it!
1,"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."
1,Purchased before going on vacation. Good price and compact design. Works great better than paperbacks
1,love my kindle it's awesome read on it in the dark all the time
1,Reliable with great memory and storage. Excellent battery life. Would recommend to young and old.
0,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,"
1,This is a great product. Easy to use and very user friendly.
1,"This is helpful if you read for more than 30 minutes. I have personally noticed that after 6hr reading, I have no headache or strain in my eyes.Also battery life is unlimited. Charge it once for a couple of hours and your are good to go for 2 weeks of extensive reading."
1,I haven't finished setting this up. But the demo section explains how to setup. Alexa seems ready to follow the commands.
1,"I had the original kindle fire from many years ago that survived many a drop onto concrete floor without sustaining any damage, so I hope this one will last as long. Easy to start up and charges fast. Already had a couple of os updates that were very fast downloading and installing. No problems."
0,"The product works fine, but you need to install a bunch of apps to use to its full potential."
1,"We now own 4 Kindle Fires, they keep getting better. Very pleased"
1,Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.
1,Amazon kindle is a very good to keep yourself busy with a good book.
0,Very nice size. Now only 50$. There's no Google play store so can't use Google Chrome cast to watch movies on tv. A tablet Without a Google play store is a disadvantage.
1,"When I made this purchase, it was for what I thought was a nice little gadget that would allow me to listen to Amazon Unlimited Music. I plugged it in and the setup was a breeze. I was able to get the Amazon Unlimited Music at a great price (only $3.99/mo if used only on an Echo product), and the quality amazed me.Then, I was in another room and decided to see how far this could pick up my voice commands...and spoke, loudly, a command to play music from one of my playlists, and the Amazon Echo actually heard me correctly...from three rooms away!So I started checking this item out a bit more. It now turns on my TV (I already had a Harmony hub), can use it to change channels, turn on Roku, etc. With just a few other smart home gadgets, this Amazon Echo can turn lights off and on all by voice commands. It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music. All in all an EXCELLENT product that not only makes life easier, but fun!"
1,Alexa works great with music. Just wish you didn't need premium spotty to use it on alexa.
1,A friend recommended this. And I am loving how easy it was to use.
1,"Use this to stream Netflix, hulu, sling TV, and now Vue tv. Ended up canceling sling TV bc Vue tv is better and more channels for less."
1,"Excellent tablet I have used , I will recommend to my friends."
1,The fire tv outperforms the Apple TV I have already installed on my tv. Great 4K playback and great selection of apps.
1,Works good for a cheap tablet to have around work and not worry about. Freezes occasionally but not a big deal for the cost.
1,"I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet."
1,I have 2 other tablets that I use. It doesn't work well as a tablet. I bought to use as a kindle. It works great as a cheaper kindle.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it! Long battery life, small and convenient to carry and great book selection."
1,I bought this kindle before travelingin Asia for 6 weeks. I didn't want to bring any expensive electronics I case anything happened. This tablet did everything I hoped and more. It was perfect for reading and keeping in touch with people back home.
1,This case is great. It feels very secure around my tablet. I'm much more confident carrying my Fire around. Love the fact that it stands either portrait or landscape.
1,Fixed problem after several power bumps/outages even with surge protector. Happy spending cost for new power adaptor vs. new Echo
1,Super fast streaming TV. Great content. Endless entertainment
1,My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
1,"I still haven't used the camera, once I figure it out I will use it. I love the features on it. I use it for facebook mostly & emails. I also play some of the games on facebook."
1,It was a great kindle fire! It functions well as a reading device and a tablet. Plays good audio books.
1,"Quality and packaging is nice.It's a Kindle USB charger, it works what more can I say.I also charge my Bluetooth earphones with this."
0,"I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run. It's not a power house per-se but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. The UI is realitivley snappy as well.Pros:- Price- IPS Screen viewable at most angles- Works well with the Amazon eco systemCons:- Mono sound (1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit)- Stuck Pixels out of the box- Low Resolution- Device registration issuesIn closing I would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations."
1,"I gave the Amazon Echo as a gift. My friend is ""setup challenged"", so I was expecting a call to head over to get it going. Instead, I received a call telling me how much she LOVED it!"
1,"Have not yet received it yet, but I am sure it will be great, as I was assure if was what I would need to go with my Kindle Voyage Reader to recharge it. I am anxiously awaiting for the arrival of my reader so I can start getting books to read. Sincerely, JudieMae"
0,Bought this for my daughter and she didn't care for it when it came to the apps. Works great for reading.
1,I love my Echo and the ease in using it. I may buy another one.
1,Sometimes the screen is not as responsive as I would like it to be but it does what we need it to do and our daughter loves it.
1,"If you have amazon prime membership, I would suggest this device, also not, the remote has access to alexa, so there is more possibilities for using it with smart home devices"
1,I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break
1,I bought this for my granddaughter so she could have it to watch movies and play games. She loves it and takes it everywhere she goes. It is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her.
1,I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
1,Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
1,"I never thought I would ever purchase a Kindle device for reading books, but now that I have one, I wish I would have done this a long time ago. I enjoy being able to read anywhere. Plus being able to purchase a book anytime I want is such a nice feature."
1,"Perfect for the bathroom, we love it! We have about 6 Alexa's in the house now and planning on sticking with this AI."
1,Like it better than the keyboard one. No need for a case with light the brightness adjusts which makes it nice.
0,"Since it is called powerfast, I thought it is a fast charger but it is not fast at all. It worked but it took about 5 hours to charge an almost empty Kindle Fire HD 8 inch tablet."
1,It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
1,"We are using Alexa for many daily chores, music, weather, radio etc."
1,a lot less buffering than the fire stick. this is almost as quick as my Nvidia shield. wish i could download android apps
1,Was very pleased with this product. Glad it worked out and provides flexibility for use.
1,Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite was well worth the upgrade from my previous Kindle E-Reader. The touch screen capability makes it so much handier than turning pages and navigating with buttons, and the lighted display lets me sit and read wherever I like. These features use up battery a bit faster than the basic model, but recharging more frequently is not so bad considering the conveniences gained. I noticed one bothersome quirk, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Sometimes it jumps ahead more than one page when I touch to turn. Checking online, I see that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. If it continues or becomes more bothersome, I will contact Amazon customer service for a solution."
0,"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive."
1,Gave this tablet to my son's girlfriend for Christmas . She loves it!
1,"I have a total of 6 firetv box at my house, most of the time, cable has nothing serious to watch, but with firetv, you will find something for sure to watch....."
1,Very easy to set up and easy to use for grandkids. Love the ease of use and the amount of information the Echo can be used for
1,I bought 2 of these for my 5-year-old nieces for Christmas. They both travel frequently and the Fire provides hours of entertainment. There is a ton of child-appropriate content available to download. The Fire is a great alternative to a pricier tablet.
1,"Bought this to replace my older Kindle Fire 6, got a 64GB MicroSD card for it and no problem. Only issues I'm having is in apps but its due to the app. The colour and sound on this kindle is just great and I love the bigger screen and the fact I can add extra memory to it in order to allow more to remain on it for a longer time."
1,she says it gives her what she wants and love it very much.
1,I think everyone knows by now that this is a must have item. If you find it on sale and don't already have one then you should probably buy it. It's a great product.
1,"Amazon Fire TV is worth the cost for me , I watch a lot of shows.The game controller and games, not so much. They remind me of the old style joy stick games...sorry I bought that part., its hard to use."
1,"I purchased 2 as xmas gifts for kids. Perfect size and I could set up child accounts under my existing Amazon account. Win, win!"
1,"Helps keep my son entertained on long rides, and it's pretty indestructible."
1,"Fun product. Especially handy for putting entire music collection in one place with Super easy access via verbal commands. Also handy for hands free notation such as setting timer while cooking or jotting down shopping list. ""Alexa- set timer for 5 minutes and add garlic to shopping list"""
1,"It has an excellent collection of apps, interface is really smooth and no hick ups."
1,"So far I'm enjoying it but I do miss my wireless headset receiver on the Roku 3 remote remote.I switched because im able to put Kodi on the Fire TV, you cannot on Roku 3"
1,Nice product but does not always respond to voice commands which have to be repeated.
1,I am pleased that my 6 year old grandson was happy with his gift
1,"Great quality, over priced apple tablets! Fire has domain! Simplicity! Overall easy to navigate!"
1,"The Fire Tablet is not only affordable, but a great piece of technology for choldren. The selection of books and games are very good."
1,I got this for my wife. She loves it. Very user friendly. Forever battery life.
1,Very convenient enjoy having Alexa around the house
1,Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.
1,It's a bit pricey but that is not Best Buy's fault since Amazon controls that. It's convenient for traveling (especially at night since it has the built-in light feature) and it's very small and light to carry around.
1,Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.
1,"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
1,Like to ask questions to Alexa without have to move from my chair. Really like the skills that relate to what I like and what I need.
1,"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores."
0,If your looking for a simple tablet that does basic things? This is the one for you. I like it.
1,"easy to use, best value for the price, and i would recommend this product to everybody"
1,Great way to increase your music library without buying cds
1,"Works well my little loves it,battery life great.."
1,My kids adore their tablets! Best purchase ever!!!
1,"I was somewhat skeptical about getting this tablet, and especially for that low of a price. But no later than 1 week I went back and purchased another one for my wife. This Amazon Kindle Fire is awesome."
1,My daughter loves it. She loves the books that she can read.
1,No complaints from a functional tablet that does all you need for a great price!
1,Cool. A lot of movies and tv I wouldn't get otherwise
1,Alexa is very much fun and informative. Definitely a must for the modern life
1,both adults and children will be delighted with this tablet.
1,Best investment I've made! Doesn't really buffer like the other sticks .
1,"Found screen display, easy use and very versatile just the right size"
1,"This tablet is great for the kids, however if going out of country might not work didn't for me overall the kids enjoy 5"
1,Good item..quality color and visual..Would buy another
1,I was tired of trying to read my books on my regular kindle fire or my phone and NEVER being able to do so because the screen was too dark or glare was to strong.This is my 3rd kindle and I love it the best! perfect indoors or outdoors. Small and compact. Fits easily in my purse or tote.
1,Very pleased with Fire TV. It works as described. Excellent item
1,"Echo is great fun particularly if you have connected devices like Wemo or Lifx bulbs or Next thermostat. At first you think you may not use that much, then you find yourself telling it to turn on the lamp or turn down the thermostat, like when you are cooking and your hands are messy. I have a lot of Wemo switches and Lifx bulbs, and it's fun to group them together and tell Echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once. It's also fun to ask her about actors and actresses on tv while watching, like how old is so and so person. Alexa is not perfect, but she is pretty good at getting things right most times. The bad thing is you'll find yourself wanting to buy more Wemo switches and stuff just to have fun with Echo. Note, Alexa can only control Wemo bulbs by using IFTT, but the switches it has direct integration with. Lifx bulbs have direct integration, but you can't change the colors without IFTT I think, and Nest thermostat has direct integration. Looking to the future for more direct integration of things."
1,"This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time."
1,Great price and great for young one and a good tablets for beginners
1,"I've was married to the same man for 30 something yrs and they was the best time in my life we have kids that's all grown and they have kids now. I love them deeply but they all are upset with me because they haven't had a Christmas ,I always get my Grand kids something but it hasn't happen in 3 yrs. I can't seem to be able to afford it any more I thought the kids would love the tablet I know they will because they all stay on computer like me it's educational for them and my self. I'm disable and have nothing to do so"
1,My mom love this tablet. The graphics is cool and neat and my mom can see everything.
0,I got this tablet for my son works good enough for his age. I recommend this tab for kids
1,I really have enjoyed using my Kindle on airplanes. I can read without turning the overhead light on.
1,bought this one for my son in law. He was using his phone for internet. Now he is able to get on the internet a lot easier.
1,It seems Alexa doesn't really do anything for free. Haha. You have to subscribe to just about everything. I tried it for a couple of days and returned it.
1,I like that you can access thousands of movies or tv shows. Just make sure you have enough speed on your router.
1,The Amazon Echo is lots of fun to use. It is so smart! Easy to set up.
1,Seamless transition from old device. Easy to use. Completely happy.
1,If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!
1,It has been nice having the echo love it bought dot for g daughter
1,"this is the best e-reader, great quality, great price."
1,"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
1,"This is actually my second one. If you are between this or the echo dot -buy this unless you need the smaller size of the dot. The dot speaker is very poor, but you can connect to a Bluetooth speaker. But the speaker in this one is super!! Sounds as good as my Bose speaker"
1,My husband prefers the Paperwhite model over the Voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat fingers since it has a larger frame so more room for the fingers. And Kindle Paperwhite and Voyager models are much easier to read for long hours than tablets (easier on the eyes). I have an iPad and still have a Kindle for reading. I highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite and Voyager models.
1,"Solid product, great speaker, but another device to help you consume media and spend money. Alexa order me stuff!"
1,I like the tablet. We got it for my nephew who is 5. He can easily use it daily. He has a lot of educational games downloaded and it stays charged for awhile.
1,"I bought this thing thinking it's a cool little gadget. But I have to admit, she has the ability to do a lot of things. It's like Siri on steroids! With the appropriate items, she's able to turn on/off lights, order things through Amazon and they just announced that she will soon be able to interact with the bmw i3! The kids especially love it, they just wish she can do their homework!"
1,I'm very accustomed to using verbal commands with my Samsung Galaxy... Same experience
1,I love my FireStick but the addition of 4K streaming is worth getting the FireTV. It seems to be noticeably faster as well.
1,Best Tablet under $50. It works great with a perfect size to hold in hand. Great deal.
1,This is my first kindle paperwhite.Great battery life and Best E-paper tablet.
1,"This is the best streaming device in the market. Fast & easy setup. Allows u2 program it and hookup peripheral devices such as mouse, keyboard.Firestick is only 2.4Ghz, so make sure to get the box. It also has ability to stream via hardwire."
1,Very comfortable to read from - doesn't give off a bright light if reading at light. Doesn't strain eyes
1,Both of my kids purchased one of these and love them. They are inexpensive and so far durable.
1,"It's a great little gadget , but I'm a little bit disappointed she doesn't understand my accent to well ."
1,My three yr. Old is loving his tablet. He likes to see the free games and I can monitor very early every time he logs in. Great product for the fam.
1,Great product for our needs and great value! Bought one for my son and a second for my mom.
1,I have two of these and four Fire Sticks. They are great for accessing Amazon content and any of your other favorite streaming apps/games. With a moderate Internet speed there is virtually no delay for programming to start. Alexa remote is handy so you can quickly search.
1,It works well for what I am using it for. To access shows.
1,Great table for kids. Easy to use. Good Parental control.
0,"This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not."
1,This is a great movie box. Subscribe to Amazon and you'll have access to tons of content. Games are cool addition also.
1,I bought this for my daughter and it was worth it. Everything works well. Camera is good. My daughter watches her shows without problems.
1,sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable
1,Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it!
1,The best e-reader to use and handle. This is my 2nd one and will get another one in the future. Recommend this e-reader
1,"Really impressed with this little device. It has all the. Ells and whistles including 4K UHD streaming in Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon Video. However, it does not stream in HDR ( not a deal breaker for me). Love this device."
1,I bought this Tablet for my Wife. She uses it every day. It is very usefulto her. She uses it in place of a computer. She watches movies on it.The Graphics are excellent.
1,8/18/16Love the product & price.Would recommend.Customer.
1,"Very goodWas undecided between new PaperWhite and Voyage models and doing a lot of research to see which one is best. Based on some personal analysis on in-store samples, I felt the Voyage has nothing more price worthy than what new PW could offer with lesser $$$. If you are undecided like me, don't worry about the gimmicks of voyage, go for PW.."
1,It is very easy to operate and comes in handy for news weather and good way to keep up with your calendar.
1,I bought two of it. I love the way the battery last for a long time.
0,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
1,"It works and streams very good, like the memory and it's still portable"
1,"It's fantastic! All my photo albums, movie purchases, Amazon prime movies in one place."
1,Will play your cloud based music or I Heart Radio station with excellent sound. I have also used it to check the weather everyday and my wife uses it for a timer when cooking. I also like it being linked to my calendar and just asking what is on the calendar today and it will tell me.
1,"It is better than in thought it was. At first I didnt like how small the screen was, but then the conistent reading, it got much better. After a month i it grew on me."
1,It was better than I thought it would be. We use it everyday!
1,Used this on a trip from SF to Maui for my 4 year old. She loved it. Perfectly suited for a toddler.
1,Bought for my 3 year old and she loves it! Haven't had any issues!
1,This product works just as well as the higher-priced ones from the cell phone company.
1,I purchased this for my son and its the best thing I bought.
1,This is a great tablet and I love using it.it is simple to use and I'm happy that I purchased it.
1,I bought this for my daughter who has Down's Syndrome. It was an inexpensive first time tablet for her. She absolutely loves it and is always watching her shows and videos. It is easy for her to navigate and understand.
1,I got a Fire Stick and have noticed that it was a mistake in not having waited for the Amazon Fire T.V. instead. The performance in this Fire T.V. is great. Performs faster and easier than its 1st (Fire Stick). Glad I got it.
1,"BYE BYE CABLE TV, KODI ON THE FIRE TV TAKES OVER..YES SIR"
1,I am happy with this product thus far. I like the size and the screen quality is just okay. I am use to the iPad quality of screen.
1,Very good deal!! Quality top with very good price!!!
1,Upon purchasing this I couldn't imagine what I was missing. It has been a great upgrade to my home. It has really brought my home closer to the new age
0,Alexa is handy but doesn't always work. We have two lights outside and sometimes both with turn on or off when commanded and sometimes only one will turn on or off.
1,This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.
1,Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.
1,"I just love the Amazon Echo. It does so many things that I've almost started to take them for granted. From the time I get up in the morning or when I get home from work Alexis is ready. First thing in the morning I ask about the weather and a synopsis of the news. I have her play music while I'm getting ready for work. I can set a timer if I'm cooking or to remind me it's time to leave. If a question pops into my head I can ask Alexis. If I want to know what's on my calendar for the day, I ask Alexis. Where have you been all my life?"
1,It's great deal for a person who's working at nite. Thanks
1,"Love the ease and convenience of Amazon Echo......there are so many things that ""she"" can do with just a ""voice command"". Our favorite is turning on the lights, controlling the NEST, and playing music!!"
1,this amazon fire table is a great bargain. its not a top of the line table and you can tell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price does a whole lot! day to day regular use or just for kids and people that dont really care about some extra features that flagship tablet bring its amazon!
1,"Alexa has come in handy by giving calculations while cooking, weather reports, and even settling arguments about trivia facts. Very nice!"
1,"This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password."
0,"Bought this as a present for my boyfriend, and we both were very disappointed. I read lots of reviews and thought it would be an awesome gift to give. Alexa is a Siri downgrade. Don't waste your money on this."
1,I recommend this to everyone! Love having all my videos in one spot and easy to use! Plus parental controls to stop purchases and restrict shows!
1,I had previously purchased one for our family and when they went on sale I purchased one for my daughter. Everyday I find something new to use it for.
1,Have it located in our kitchen and is great for listening to your Amazon music. Voice recognition is good and we also use the timer function often. The quality of the sound is good too with decent bass.
0,I don't care for having to close each window separately I would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all
1," I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it."
1,"This has been one of the best ""set-top box"" replacement experiences ever. I love that it combines all available online video contents in one. Great interface and very stable too!"
1,The tablet is good. It is a little slow but I'm not sure if it's my wifi or the tablet. I like that you can add a memory card :)
1,Great charger
1,"This is the best cord cutter streaming box on the market. I've owned Roku, Apple TV, and Chromecast and this is by far the best. Offers great performance, the remote is very user friendly and I think it has a better selection of apps. The interface is laid out nicely but feels a little compact with a lot of stuff on the screen all at once."
1,headphone port did not work at first but after a hard reset the worked
1,"Bought this for my mother for Christmas. I wanted something small enough for her to handle and reliable. Decided a Fire tablet fit the bill. And, Best Buy had plenty in stock!"
1,"Alexa is very entertaining and provides a plethora of information at the sound of your voice. I must say, however that SIRI is more personable. I hope Alexa loosens up as time goes on."
1,This tablet is nice for the price. Recommended for kids or an adult who doesn't need a large screen.
1,Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
1,"Easy to use, fantastic product plethora of movies, games, and always new content being added"
1,"Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on."
1,"Fun,sometimes difficult in phrasing my question fr Alexa. I love it but still having difficulty finding the ap to enable different things. N love the music and sound is good."
1,"easy to use, easy to love. extremely user friendly. Beats the nook I had by a 1000%. the battery life is outstanding"
1,"Every time I ask Alexa for something, my 2 year old grandson runs over and tries to pronounce her name, he's almost there, hopefully he'll have a question for her as well. He likes dancing to the nursery rhymes that I ask her to play for him."
1,This is a great product! Our family loves the convenience of asking questions on the go!
1,"We purchased the tablet for our mom's 63rd birthday and she loves it!!! She had absolutely no problems when it came to the initial setup. Our mom has been reading books, listening to music, ordering items through the mail and watching videos like a pro. We couldn't have gotten her a better gift!!!"
1,Purchased this on Black Friday as a gift for my 9 year old. Set up was super easy. I like how I can create multiple profiles on the device so that my son only has access to what I want him to have access to.
0,"I was in best buy having computer worked on, waiting I saw the Amazon fire 6, and saw the great price and bought it. I have been pleased with the features and user friendly."
1,"The Echo is a very good addition to our home. Very easy to use, setup was a bit of challenge to get to my WiFi, but once I understood (I am 64), what it was trying to do, it went smooth and easy. We have had a few really good laughs as we put it through some paces, but really glad we made the purchase"
1,"My wife loves the fact that it feels like a book to her. From the weight of the reader to the brightness of the screen, it reminds her of reading a paper book. My wife is happy with the product so I gave it a 5."
1,Good price for the tablet. I brought this for my nephew
1,We bought two of these for our kids and they both love them! Easy to set up and operate. They are a welcome improvement over them using their phones for all the apps and games they enjoy.
1,I purchased two tablets for Christmas gifts and they were great!
1,great buy. excellent product. Just need to buy a cover to protect
1,"okay for a toy, does not work well for some of us, with different noise environment, and different accent. Some times the searched results are funny. Also, hope it support other languages. Price too high also."
1,"I needed a gift for my nephew who was graduating from college and who seems to have everything. Decided on the Echo since I've been wanting one and thought he probably didn't have it. I was happy when he seemed excited about receiving it, but thrilled when he kept texting me the following week to tell me how great it was and all the things he had Alexa doing for him! I'm now even more convinced that I need one for myself, especially since I am moving toward making my house a ""smart"" home."
1,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more"
1,"After reading the reviews, it's an awesome gadget added to the collection!"
1,Very easy to setup with app. You can get plenty of information and facts. I setup with pandora to play my favorite selections. I bought wemo wifi outlets but not setup yet with echo. Sound of speaker is fabulous. I also bought the dot for the bedrooms.
1,"According to my girlfriend, it is slow, but functional for simple things like web and watching TV. I bought it for game development testing and have been satisfied. Seems like an very good piece of hardware for only $50. Suspect amazon keeps the price low because they intend to make their money on selling you content through their locked-down store. It is an android tablet, but most of the google software you're used to is not there, which is the biggest downfall."
1,"Bought the Kindle Voyage and it had a yellow tint on the top half. Found out later this is a defect on most. Also, the auto light part I didn't like. Much happier with this, and it's cheaper."
1,This is so much faster than my old blueray player loading apps and streaming. Works great and so many options!!
1,Awesome tablet for kids pre loaded with a ton of things and the case is even better
1,Purchased the Kindle PaperWhite because I got tired of reading on regular tablets and ipads. Those devices really do strain your eyes...not so with the Kindle. The display is crisp and amazing. The battery life is astronomical. Highly recommended and for the price...it is a steal.
1,This is a fully functional tablet allowing you to read with comfort and in full sun. I thoroughly enjoy it.
1,Just love it. Would not leave home with out it. Recommend to any read aholic.
1,I love this box. It's the best thing out there. I cut my cable completely off. Great savings.
0,I was surprised to find it did not come with any type of charging cords so I had to purchase one and then found my Sprint HTC 3D charger is faster. I would not purchase again- 1st item I've ever not liked I've purchased from Amazon
1,bought this as a gift for my daughter who is very ill and has to be confined to indoors mostly and she loves it
1,Tablet is working good. I brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. It features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. My only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.
1,I like the product work vey well and I am very happy with it.
1,For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal
1,"Bought this as a gift for my family, mainly to play music from Amazon. Very pleased with how easy it is to set up and use."
1,"It has many uses. You can listen to music, check the weather, listen to podcasts and music. You can also use it as an alarm."
1,I bought 3 for my grandchildren and they love their tablets
1,"The possibilities are endless with the Amazon Echo. I'm just getting started with the Echo, but I know that I'll be using this for a long time."
1,My grandson loves his tablet. He recently lost his (we are not sure where) and was so happy to see the new one
1,I bought these tablets for my niece and nephew who are only 2 and 3 and they love it. My niece who's only 3 has shown my mother a few things. Great products
1,What more needs to be said. The best low price tablet out there. This is our 2nd one and it is easier to use. Our I Pad Air has more features but cost considerably more.
1,This fire TV is really awesome for viewing content the Amazon video is really great and has lots of content
1,Echo or Alexa from Amazon is smart and learns along with you. She is a nice gift for teens as well as seniors. It's the kind of thing you might think you didn't want or need until you get it and begin to use it. We like the sound quality of the speaker.
1,This is hands down the best media streaming device available today. If you have a 4k tv the box enhances the resolution any other tv the sticks will work fine.
1,"I have both the fire stick and box but, the box is my favorite by far!"
1,Somewhat awkward to setup in Canada but once done it is an amazing source of useful features. Enjoy the link to my Spotify subscription and some of the new apps that are created for the Echo. It even has a sense of humour and sharp answers to stupid questions. Well worth the price.
1,This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage
1,Wow - for 49.99? You gotta be kidding me. What a great buy for the money!
1,"Alexa is great. She plays music for me, tells me the news, tells me jokes, reminds me to get to my appointments. She sometimes misinterprets my requests. She's not perfect. She helps me with yoga."
1,Now I have fire tv in all my room is. A great product you can do a lot of thing
1,Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.
1,Perfect size and readability and function for pages turning is comfortable
1,Unit has fast response time. Graphics are very clear.
1,Great its the box that will save me money. A must buy
1,"Lots of fun, but also very useful. Have it connected to my Nest Thermostat and going to connect it to my Caséta Wireless switches. The speaker has great bass for its size. Search YouTube videos for tips and tricks. It does more then you think,"
0,"Expensive speaker. Voice recognition does not work so well. Skill set is extemely limited even though Amazon claims 10,000."
1,Great price. Useful and what I was looking for. Couldn't get the updated version yet but loved how this one operates and looks.
0,I loved the kindle. But it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. It's ruined I knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor???
1,Bought for grandkids for Christmas and they love them!!
1,I absolutely positively Love my Kindle Fire! It is the best of both worlds being a Kindle & a Inexspensive Tablet!
0,"Had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. Had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. Lots of family suggested the Amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. Well set up was a disaster. I wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one Amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. So now my 7 yr old has an Amazon account. Also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. And then had to go into settings to put a parental block on in-app purchases. Too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. In not happy with this tablet . It automatically backs up photos and stuff to an iCloud. I don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it. Also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that can't be changed. My other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal. I will not be replacing his with this product."
1,This Kindle makes for a great beginner tablet for a teenager. The only complaint is that it is a little laggy but great for the price.
1,ok tablet - can do what I need - doesn't stay charged long enough tho
0,"so far it's a nice toy in the kitchen, and it appears that there is a lot of up and coming apps that will be nice once they are all working. right now it can only do basic stuff. the speaker on it is just ok, they could improve that on the next upgrade. i don't even think it's stereo."
1,I learn more and more every day what this product can do
1,"The 7"" screen is just right for size. Comes w/ plenty of extra goodies from Amazon and Audible, among others. The only complaint is the display in bright, direct sunlight requires adjustment to full bright, or I'd have given it 5 stars."
1,I originally bought this solely for the BOINGO app. However it has a large selection of apps and I now use it everyday.
1,This is my second tablet that I have purchased. This one was a gift for other son. He loves it & I recommended it to numerous friends.
1,I think this tablet is very easy to use. It is price well.
1,Great for all round entertainment. I connected it to my Amazon account and even my phone so o could view my pictures on the TV. I unfortunately had to return it because one of the purposes for which I bought it was not fulfiled.
1,exactly what he wanted and he is very happy with it. no problems
1,I bought this for my Don's second birthday and he loves it. My five yr old loves it also. Very easy to use.
1,So far we like. Wish I could control tv. It's lil expensive but seems to work great. Decent speakers as well.
1,"Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed."
1,Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.
1,The best bang for the buck in streaming tv. Buy 1 for each tv
1,I bought this tablet for my dad who is not tech savvy what so ever. Great tablet for a beginner.
1,"I went back and forth about what kind of tablet to purchase for my child. I am very impressed with the ability for things to be simple for her to navigate as well as being able to place perimeters on how long she can use the apps, Internet, and watch videos as well as how much reading time she has to have."
1,"Wanted to buy the Amazon echo for a long time, was glad that I saw the offer best buy had, got it around 2 weeks ago and I love it so far, for me listening to music is a big part of my day and the sound on the echo is fantastic, I really like the design, Alexa is pretty helpful even though I haven't had the chance yet to fully use her capabilities but asking for a song or ordering things from Amazon is pretty easy and convenient, I have an accent and Alexa doesnt have any problems understanding me!, would definitely recommend it."
1,Purchased for a child. Works great Very pleased. Very versatile
0,I bought this during Black Friday sales the price was very attractive but I didn't find it that attractive as YouTube stream was streaming slow it was taking 10-15 min to stream a single song.
1,Bought this tablet for my husband for Christmas and it is great. Easy to use and just what he was wanting.
1,Excellant starter tablet . I love that it is preset with children in mind. I love the color choices available since I have 5 grandchildren who each got this product for Christmas
1,"I originally bought the tablet because I enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzles. Not having time to do them at home, I found apps that I could use on the cell phone while on the train. But, anything more than 125 pieces was just too many for the screen. I've found that I can do 225 piece puzzles comfortably on the Kindle and, for the amount of puzzles available and the time I can spend on them, that's good enough for me.But, the Kindle offers so much more. There are other great games and puzzle apps from the APP Store plus there's a six-month ""free"" trial subscription to the WASHINGTON POST. You can go online via WiFi and download books, read email, watch movies and videos, and surf the Internet, just like on a regular computer.It's great fun!"
1,Excellent echo radio....good invented....nice product..
1,"i can't ask for this tablet to more than what its supposed, good starter for kids before they get an iPad :)"
1,I was concerned that I was wasting my money because I already have an iPad. I was WRONG! I LOVE IT!
1,Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
1,Crazy price for tablet. Was a great christmas gift.
1,"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
1,I love this! Easy to set up and easy to use. Would recommend it for sure.
1,I gave the echo to two of my friends. They were impressed with Alexa and her instant answers to any questions that were asked. They also liked the instant access to music from Amazon Prime
1,i would recommend this to others. i think it is great for someone who is just getting into electronics.
1,Perfect item for my grand-kids and the price was especially just what I needed.
1,I liked this so much I got one for my dad and step mom along with the smart plug in outlet so they can turn on their lights!!!
0,"Alexa is great when asking about the weather, or when wanting to play some music quickly. However, majority of the questions I ask it cannot find. I think that the questions are pretty simple too. She will answer questions with direct answers like ""whats 2+2"" but if you go much further she wont respond."
1,This is our second box for our bedroom. We got our first over a year ago when we decided we were't paying a $200 cable bill each month. We have no complaints at all.
1,"I bought the amazon stick as a bday gift for my cousin. It's pretty easy to use, with its plug and play features"
1,Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts
1,These things are great if you don't want to pay high cable bills and have a prime account.
1,Not that I don't love it but I wish it would have been a little bigger. More book like.
0,It's a great tablet for the price. I bought it as a gift and they loved it.
1,This is an item I use EVERY day! I bought one for my mother in law who is paralyzed and she loves it!
1,"It's small I can take it with me where ever I go. I can read, play games, and get on the Internet. Not to mention the price was right."
1,"I have a 1st generation and 2 of the second generation FireTV devices. I've been very happy with them. What I didn't expect was my Samsung remote to work with the Amazon unit since the Amazon remote is not an IR remote, but the Samsung remote works great. Very happy with the responsiveness of the FireTV unit. Menus seem very intuitive."
1,I love the product and its easy to use would love to recommend it to friends
1,This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
1,We purchased this tablet for my 6 year old daughter to replace her RCA tablet that lasted a year. It is fabulous. I'm considering getting myself one for those long drives when your lap top is too big!
1,I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
1,Works great. Love the size and light weight. Love it!
1,Great product would highly recomend this. Sales person was really help full
1,"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"
0,It's more for people that want to read without glare
1,bought this as an upgrade for my 9 yr old son from his Nabi and he loves it
1,"This product does far more than we expecxted. We use it fore the news, weather and music"
1,Very nice....some of the apps were hard to open at first...but had to play around with....love it now! Would definitely buy more again.
1,huge visual improvement for my on the go use. works just fine.
1,"This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet."
0,"I got this for my 88 year old mother to view pics on Facebook of her children,grandchildren,great grandchildren and great great grandchildren. With the kids protection bumper she is able to handle it well. The bad side is that I wanted to hide all the other apps and could not. Plus I ended up paying an extra $15 to get rid of ads."
1,"Really good buy, has dual camera, games really good"
1,"Very happy with device ,,, may purchase second device"
1,I love my Fire. I can do so much with it plus read my books and be online also
1,I just would like to say I brought this tablet for my 11 year old. And she has had it in her hand ever since. Great buy
1,All of the sales people were very helpful with selecting the proper product
1,"Gave this to my dad for his birthday. He loves it. Can play music, keep lists, set timers, and set up my buddy which is awesome. And it only gets better."
1,It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
1,Awesome for 4 year olds. Tons of security features and very easy to use.
1,"Very happy with the Fire TV works great with all my streaming apps Netflix, Hulu and Amazon's own video app... Best of all works great with PlayStation Vue just works flawless from the interface to many different options it offers... All around a great device from being reliable, quick boot-up, to no lagging and no buffering... Totally recommend especially for Amazon Prime members..."
0,not as good as the first kindle fire I got and ok product.
1,"My son was 2 years old when he received this tablet, the apps and games are fun and instructional, the cover really nakes it drop and shatter proof, I have it set on a timer so it turns off after 20 minutes of use, on days when he seems to be more interested I will let him use it longer, other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it."
1,Loved this kindle! Bought it for my siblings. They loved it too and it was cheap for me!
1,"Great device. Very fast and responsive. Capable of streaming in 4k and while there is limited content, it comes thru beautifully. Alexa and voice search is fantastic."
1,"While I find myself limited at the moment to playing music and adding to my grocery list, I look forward to expanding my connected home. For what I use it for, it is fantastic. It even works great with answering questions the kids have and responding quickly to needs. It understands fairly well and it hears me throughout the house."
1,"This is a great upgrade, with the touch screen but still with the perfect ability to read outside!Set up is idiot proof and very quick. I like that you can have two accounts on it now, as my husband uses it also. Has a very long battery life and is pretty rugged as I dropped a couple of times.If you love to read outside this is the product for you!"
1,"This has to be one of the best deals around - The screen resolution is good, the speed is adequate and it is versatile as a reader, game device or internet tablet."
0,"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it."
1,thanks
1,"I got an 8"" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift."
1,"The sound is amazing,will do many things like your shopping list,tell jokes and many other things..."
1,Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.
1,"Awesome video streaming device. Great picture quality, easy hook up. Out of everything this media device offers I must say the sound quality gets 5 stars. If you have this device connected to your surround sound you will not be disappointed at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I can't connect my hard drive to watch my home family video's the USB slot does not recognized my home movies on my hard drive or thumb drive."
1,Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well
1,Easy to set up. Has great sound. Nice to talk too.
1,Great for listening to music. Real nice sound. My 7 year old loves being able to control Alexia.
1,"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
1,"Best device ever, don't' use my Bose radio any more"
1,Great product! Amazon prime music is at my disposal at allTimes. The skills are sweet. Totally worth the money.
1,I personally have 3 of these in my home and we love them. I love the fact that I can set restrictions for my kids. Great product
1,I originally purchased the Amazon fire stick which I did not like at all! it was very slow and it didn't stream Netflix well. I returned the fire stick in exchange for the Amazon fire TV and holy cow what a difference. Everything streams so quickly and it works tremendously well with Wi-Fi. Only bad thing is you have to restart it from time to time to refresh the system.
1,"was easy to set up, easy to use somethings are limited like music unless you have a prime account, like music, however I did find out you can use pandora or music saved on your phone. Overall a great product still learning new stuff everyday."
1,"I have enjoyed this Kindle Fire. Each day, I find something new to explore and I'm thrilled I purchased it."
1,Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.
1,Works as it should and gives us the ability to stream 4K.
0,It's a cheap version to allow my wife to read books and such. No pretense that it's anything like an iPad but it's doing exactly what it should do for the price point it's set at.
1,"This is my first streaming TV device and I am new to the technology. It was very easy to set up and configure, taking only a few minutes. It worked like a charm! I then downloaded Kodi onto the device, following a youtube instructional video. While Kodi takes a little more patience and time, once installed, it is an awesome supplement to the Fire TV. Between the built-in service offerings and the vast amount of free streaming services offered via Kodi, this device is a 100% winner!!! No more cable and satellite TV subscriptions for this person!!"
1,great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
1,"I get this for my 11 years old daughter ... Is good, basic tablet"
1,Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.
1,Works as well as any of the other more expensive tablets. Resolution is great and size is practical.
1,"When I first grabbed an echo I thought it would be kinda gimmicky, but I loved it so much I bought two more echos and several dots. I have Alexa all over the house. The smart home integration is so wonderful. I feel like I am living in Star Trek when Alexa turns my lights on and off and does other tasks."
1,Easy to use. Awesome price. Best Buy had in stock when amazon didn't. Recommend.
1,"love these so much we now have 4 Echo (Kitchen, living room, basement and outdoor area) and 2 Dots for bedrooms. Now that they can play everywhere together it's great going from one room to another with music playing in all rooms when we are entertaining. Highly recommend!"
1,"It is great to read books on the go! Easy to use, and easy to add pdf's and other files you may want on there!"
1,Good tablet for a beginner. Easy to navigate and get more apps!
1,Just excellent product.great sound.great features.answers most questions.
1,I had this kind of tablet before. I like it therefore I I purchased it again. I do recommend this tablet.
1,I wish ir had all the free aps on Google play store. I am finding I have to pay for alot of the free ones I am use to.
1,Hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick. I bought this to replace my previous one that only did 1080p. Having had both I would say you won't go wrong with either. I bought the firetv for the direct Internet plug in capability which I figured would be a concern with wifi
1,Bought this for my son for Learning and fun we take it everywhere with us works great
1,The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!
1,"Minimizes buffering, don't have to have wireless internet. Seems to load faster then the stick."
1,It does everything a regualur tablet can do and it cheap
1,"The Amazon Fire TV box is better than using the ""smart"" software built-in on any Blu-ray player or TV I've owned. Those brands include Sony, Mitsubishi, and Samsung. It is very responsive when navigating menus and making selections. If you're not an Amazon Prime member, be prepared to have that in your face - this is an Amazon device after all. The remote is minimalist in style and has the mic built-in for speaking to Alexa, which is a plus in my book."
1,I love it. These things are sold out everywhere. Except at BestBuy.
0,"Had all kinds of problems in registering it and getting it to work Had Customer service from Best Buy, Amazon and my internet provider trying to help, but to no avail."
1,I love my fire... The games and the pictures great
1,It was an amazing deal for my little cousin. This is a great tablet!!
1,"I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
1,My granddaughter Bella love this alexa so I got her another one for Easter
1,Great deal and wonderful product. Saving money on cabls
1,love it. does what it does extremely well. The fastest box i own and I've owned them all.
1,Great device. Much faster than the Amazon fire stick.
1,I needed a simple tablet to use in my car on long trips. Bought two of these and boy do they deliver!!! The best tablets for this price. The kindle book reader is an added bonus. The finishing is good. My kids love it.
1,My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.
1,"Would have to think about purchasing this at full price. I got another one this year for the black friday, $30 price. After adding a microSD card I use them for large Ipod alternatives. A lot cheaper than buying the Ipod and does the same thing."
1,"I bought this grudgingly as a way to read in bed without a light that bothered my wife. As it turns out I'm really glad I did. The light is adjustable and the ""print"" is crisp and clear. Even better is the ability to enlarge the print which has been helpful to my old eyes. There is a great ebook selection available from the library and many cheap books available on Amazon."
1,Very fast at loading apps and downloading movies and TV shows. Would highly recommend. Also have a firestick and the box is much faster and has more memory.
1,The point of a kindle is to read it like a paper print and this product achieves that. I considered the higher level products but settled on this as the best value option. The product met expectation.
1,"Have enjoyed this kindle, especially for the price."
1,Excellent low cost table. Fair for the price!!!!!!!!
1,Good product with best price available in the market place
1,"You can't beat the price...Picked this one up for only $60 from Best Buy..I like the additional control parents have with kindles. It's great when you want to limit your kid's time on youtube, games etc. I would certainly recommend this to a friend.."
1,"I toyed with the idea of getting an Echo. Now that I have one, I love Alexa. She lives in the kitchen: ""Alexa, set the timer for 10 minutes."" Using IFTTT.com, she integrates with my Nest thermostat, my Rachio watering system, etc. She lets me know when stuff from Amazon is coming. She is there to answer questions. But she can be annoying when Jeopardy is on the TV. Some contestants with the right voice will give their answer -- remember, the answer is a question -- ""Who is Queen Elizabeth II?"" And, Alexa will tell you all about Queen Elizabeth II. How can you not love her?"
1,Small and cheap gift for my nieces who like to listen to bible stories
1,GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
0,Apps and streaming run great. Searching and growing movie and show selection could use some tweets.
1,It's slick and small and it works great! I love it
1,Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.
1,"I bought the Echo for my bedroom, but moved it more central to the house so that I could use it more. It's super convenient to be able to just say something out loud and have her take note of what you need. From playing Alt Nation on Sirius XM to setting a timer to needing the weather at a vacation destination, Alexa always has the answer. My only complaint is that when I have music playing loudly, Alexa does not respond to turning off, but it's such a minor issue. The music quality is unreal from such a small unit! I'm definitely buying more for around the house."
1,Perfect for kids with the child profile. Only downside is the limited space
1,Bought this to run the Kodi app. It's awesome!!!!!
1,This product is the best item HANDS DOWN! Love IT!
1,This Kindle is amazing for children and tweens. Its sturdy and light and fun to use.
0,Very good experience okay at the Niles Ohio location. Great price for children 6 to 11 that aren't real responsible. Did not buy warranty on the tablets priced a little high for something that was as priced as low as they were.
1,"Good for streaming off internet , no buffering on Lodi and live tv !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I purchased this as a temporary tablet after my old one died. Now, I have no desire to buy a different tablet any time soon. For the price, it is great. It does everything that I require a tablet to do, especially after paying the $15 on Amazon to disable ads. Well worth the price."
1,"great for the whole family, there is something for everyone, all ages!"
1,Opened it up and didn't realize it was what he had almost bought for himself.A lot of fun and very helpful in answering questions we have.Will expand to work with home appliances on birthday's. Love it.
1,Bought this to get rid of cable tv. Works great ! Very easy to set up and was able to get this working in no time.
1,"The Echo is a cool speaker and has some neat tricks if you're vested in the Amazon universe. I am not. It's still neat as a bluetooth speaker, but if it weren't on sale, I would not find as much utility for the price."
1,"The whole family likes talking to Alexa. It provides lots of tips, answers, songs, etc. Of course it gets much better after you train it and download more skills. Great product."
1,Bought for my son and he loves it. Fast and great for playing games
1,"Its a great all around tablet, with all the extra features you need if your an avid reader."
1,Works as expected
1,"Love the tablet, just wish they had included a booklet with it and not just an on line referral. Since this is not my first tablet I was familiar with things, but for a new user, I think a booklet of some sort would be a help"
0,This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
1,"Great for children, nonexpensive very durable easy to use"
1,This wall charger works exactly as described for the Kindle Paperwhite.
1,"I have the first version, and I can't wait to see my son face when he gets for Christmas"
0,Worth the money when on sale-slow connection compared to a laptop
1,Nice for music and home automation control. Used ha-bridge to call home genie api uri's.
1,Enjoyed it so much on one tv we decided to put itOn an additional tv in bedroom. Will be phasing out of DIRECTV soon.
1,"Alexa is great for keeping shopping lists,controllong my wemo switches and playing music. As good as Siri for trivia, but they still both have a way to go to become less frustrating. Liked product so much we purchased the dot for upstairs and it works equally as well."
1,Love my new Kindle Voyage. I have an original Kindle but this one does so much more. Recommend it highly.
1,Works fine for me.
1,Brought for my mom and she loves it worth every penny
1,"Got it at a very good price, and it did not disappoint me. Mainly used by my kids, I can set up and control exactly what they can view, read and play. Each one has his own user, so they can personalize their experience with it as well. Works well, does the job, and again, at a very good price."
1,"It's a wonderful tablet and e-reader for what you pay. My only complaint is it's a little laggy and the screen is sometimes unresponsive. I also don't like that I can't put my ebooks on my memory card. It's frustrating. Other than that, it's wonderful."
1,Love it. Makes home automation a breeze. Easy setup
1,This was a simple set up. Worked immediatel . We added the net gear extender due to the size of our house and llocation of our tv.
0,I had wanted a Fire for about 3 Years but didn't pick one up but this time I did. Wasn't what I thought it would be like.
1,"If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect."
1,"I love my my fire TV, it has everything you need to stream shows/movies to your TV."
1,Everything I wanted. Still learning on using her..
1,The Kindle Paperwhite works exactly as expected. I have no complaints.
1,"We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......"
1,I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ...
1,This was a Christmas gift andmy son is pleased with it!
1,"What a deal, this tablet has all you need to get basic things accomplished and enough power to complete more difficult tasks. Highly recommended for the price, value"
1,PURCHASED FOR A 92 YEAR YOUNG LADY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY BEJEWLED BLITZ. SHE LOVES IT !
1,This is my second paperwhite kindle & I can't imagine not having one with me all the time.
1,"Worth getting, great for the priceAnd very handy for movies and music"
1,I love the voice command and online resources !!!!
1,Got a great deal. I don't think I'd spend more than $100 on it. Works well with xm though.
1,Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.
1,"I love the versatility of the Echo, It has a great music sound and does so much more."
1,My first kindle. Really like it. Glad I bought it!
1,works for my purposes. It is easy to use and easy for my kids to use
1,Couldnt have been a better product for day to day reading
1,My favorite feature is that it will play almost any music you ask it to and it answers almost anything you ask it.
1,Great product. Amazon got it again. Can browse everything I need with ease.
0,We bought this tablet for my son for Christmas. It's a decent tablet for a kid and the price is reasonable. I would recommend it for a person who's not big on technology. It's definitely not an IPad!!!!
1,"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
1,"Echo is a nice addition to my ahem becoming automated home (not close). What I like with it are easy to use and setup, there still a lot of improvement to do but overall it's nice to have it as long the maker of it will continue to update Alexa to keep up with.this fast paced technology of us."
1,I love this kindle. You can read clear in bright sunlight and it's so easy to carry around. The letters are crisp and easy to read. It's just like holding a book but without the curling pages. You will not be disappointed.
1,"Easy to install. Great for playing music. Check the weather, news with just a question?"
1,Got this for my 3 yo and he is enjoying it. The case is worth it's price in gold.
1,"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this."
1,"This is a great device for book readers! It's larger than the former kindle, has great light and easy to operate."
1,great tablet and very easy to use. very easy to grab and go
1,"Love the ease to use,the back light, and the size. Previous kindle died after 10 years was worried I would not like the changes but now I read even more because of the ease of using and light."
1,I love my Echo. I use it everyday. I recommend it.
1,Lots of features at a great price. I would recommend this product.
1,"The screen is beautiful. It does everything the iPad can do if not more. You are definitely not settling for less but, keeping more money in your pocket if you choose this device over and iPad."
1,I love this device! It works so well and is easy on the eyes. Having on device hold all of my books and being able to get new books so easily is the best feature for someone like me who is an avid reader.
0,"Thought I'd be enjoying this more. Clever interface when Alexa gets it right, more frustrating than it should be when she gets you wrong!"
1,"My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better."
1,Works great and KODI is totally worth the price becaus you save a lot on not having to use Netflix anymore
1,Easy to hook up and use. Great sound. I use this device in many ways every day!
1,I am very satisfied with my Kindle Fire. I am amazed how good it is for the price. I am visually impaired and the voice over is excellent.
1,Awesome for the price perfect for little ones if you don't want to worry about them cracking the screen or dropping the product and paying a lot of money
1,bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
1,My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
1,Can't play word games or monopoly but other than that great
1,Got these for our kids when we go on vacation. Easy for them to use.
1,"I was looking for a tablet that I could download movies on for my toddler to watch on long car rides. This Kindle Fire has great parental settings so I don't have to worry about my child accidentally buying things or seeing inappropriate content. This runs much cleaner and faster than older generation Fires. I was a little taken back by the size since I have a much bigger one, but It'll work out great for what I wanted it for. I did notice I have 2 burnt out pixels, but they don't bother me enough to return or exchange."
1,I think the concept is modern & works well most of the time. We have had to pair it several times but that may be our internet service. The most frustrating think is when you have named the bulbs and say Alexa hallway light on/off she doesn't understand what you are saying and repeats something totally different.
1,"While I have used an ipad in the past, this is hands down a huge improvement in the ability to read books. The backlighting and type font are great and it is extremely easy to download books."
1,"when I compare the screen of this voyage to my previous paperwhite, the qualify of the display was much better. light is more even and soft."
1,"What a great tablet for for the grand kids.easy to use,can't say how many times it's hit the floor and no damage."
1,I bought this for my 8 year old. Very cost effective and lots of fun for him.
1,"This was a perfect gift for my daughter, especially as she gets ready to go to college."
1,Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.
1,This is a very affordable tablet for a kid just bought a case online. And it's perfect for taking it around.
1,Easy setup and I never get tired of using it. My wife uses Echo all the time.
1,I love it!! I would definately refer my friends and family to buy one for their TV's also
1,need more expects on tablet & computer with nohow.
1,"Got this for my fianc and she loves how easy it is to use, and how light the product is. Would highly recommend to all book readers."
1,"This was bought as a replacement for an older kindle fire that my mother had worn out! Very easy to use! My mother still uses a flip phone, because she doesn't like dealing with new technology, but she uses her kindle everyday and without and issues. Definitely recommend for elderly consumers. The only issue is the charger port! That's what went wrong with her last fire. Desperately needs reworking, if not already in the works."
1,"Love this hardware!! Only issue is occasionally you have to do a hard reset of the box, I was getting messages my bandwith wasn't high enough and couldn't watch streaming movies. Once I turned off/turned on...back to normal. That's the only issue so far. Otherwise highly recommend and love it!"
1,"I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited. Unless you have Amazon Prime or devices that can attach to it, using its enabled skills. Would recommend as an accessory to a smart home, or for someone invested in the Amazon Eco System."
1,"I like to use my Echo to set my Alarm. I just say, ""Alexa, set my alarm for 6:30 am."" and I am confident that Alexa will lead me into the next morning."
1,GreAt Sceen love to watched movies and my favorite tv snows!!
1,"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
1,Great personal assistant. Sometimes when music is playing loud Alexa can't here or understand the commands. Speaker is more powerful than expected. Ties in nicely with smart home appliances. Looks like this is more compatible with 3rd party devices than the Google Home.
0,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
1,Worth the money it is a very useful device . Buy this if you are an avid reader
1,I enjoy being able to play my rain music and falling asleep with ease.
1,Bought this for my elderly aunt. Was able to customize it so that it would be very simple to use for games. Amazon customer service is amazing.
1,I have purchased two of these for my children. This is sturdy and easy to use. There are parental controls as well. My 12 y/o and my 10 y/o operate these with ease. I am thinking of purchasing one as a gift for my mother.
0,You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 3 year old it's ok
1,"Have basic kindle and operation of Paperwhite is much different, catching on as I use it. Nice unit."
1,"This is a fun and convenient toy; however, it doesn't have the capability to answer as many re questions as I would have thought."
1,"wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money."
1,"Got this on a lark for my 9 yr old and mother-in-law who does not have a smart phone because of the Black Friday price. It's good for the price, but the picture quality is okay. I hope it lasts."
1,"Purchased as a gift for daughter and she hasn't put it down yet.This is now her go to device over her laptop,MP3 player or phone. To me that speaks volumes!"
1,"The fire TV is definitely better than the stick. The stick used to freeze on us, but the TV doesn't seem to have any problems or delays. It works exactly as it is supposed to and helps me find programs for our son when I can't find them in other places!"
1,"Works as expected, simple setup and works perfect!"
1,It was bought for my husband and he has truly enjoyed it.
1,I will recommend for other parents to buy this product
0,"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product."
1,The images are crisp and text very easy to read. Apps are good and easy to navigate. Love it.
0,I hate the ads. They are annoying and you cannot get them off. It's super confusing how to even get to the home page
1,Does every thing I would need it to. Nice inexpensive tablet.
1,"The Amazon Echo is great. It was easy to set up. Alexis tells me the weather, plays anything I ask her and adjusts the volume at my request! Amazing."
1,"After having this for a year, it got a bit wet and called Kindle and they said they would fix it or replace it cause it was within the one year warranty. They replaced it for free."
1,it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading
1,Good movies kids. RUNS FAST. EFFICIENT. COOL TABLET.
1,I own 4 Kindles and I love them all. Purchsed the new Paperwhite because it had free 3G just wish they would make the capacity larger
1,You can do a lot with these. No pain in a smart tv when you can add one of these. The box is considerably faster than the stick but the stick is the best value.
1,"Alexa is revolutionary. She does so many things. No reason to be jealous. Bring her home,invite her in!"
0,"I had the original fire stick and I don't truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version. I was hoping that whe. The new version came out I could really understand and justify why I was paying more for a new one, when my old one worked just fine. Unfortunately, I can't. For me, it's not worth the money and I returned the item and stuck with my other one."
1,My daughter gave me one of these as a gift. My wife liked it so much I replaced her Kindle touch with a Paperwhite. Nice step up from the regular Kindle touch. We both love the backlight.No more booklights while reading at night!
1,"Okay, glad it holds alot of books, wish it had send & received email."
1,I bought this tablet for my son to watch movies and play games on and it has proven to be a great tablet so far. Would definitely recommend this tablet to any other buyer. It is tough and sturdy.
1,"get the kindle during Black Friday where I think it's the only time kindle get discount. hesitate to get it for a long time since already have the iPad, but want to do more reading, so, why not"
1,I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.
1,"I had an old kindle, and its battery was beginning to fail. The Kindle Fire 7 replaces it, with much more functionality. It does, however, require charging more often."
1,Speakers give off Great Sound. And my kids love it.
1,"Echo seems well engineered. The voice response is very natural and usually understands what I'm saying. Echo wouldn't connect to my home WiFi because I had two networks with the same SSIDs (one 2.4ghz and one 5ghz). Once I changed the name (SSID) of one of the networks, Echo connected right up and hasn't had any trouble since. Because of the WiFi issue, I took 1 star away."
1,"This Fire tablet is great -- does all I want it to Only down side, the battery only lasts a few hours and has to be recharged often. I like to read -- sometimes, while reading, have to stop and recharge. Otherwise, I love it!!"
1,"My Echo's power adapter began making a tiny but very audible noise that was disconcerting. My Echo continued to work well, but I needed to get rid of the aggravating and disconcerting noise, so I bought another adapter. This adapter works without making any noise. I am pleased with it."
1,Love my new Kindle. It was time to replace my old one. Everything is so much bet
1,I basically use it to read news articles and stories online. It works well for what I use it for.
1,"Easy to use, light weight, very good price. Highly recommend this product!"
1,"For 50 bucks, it's a nice starter tablet. Wish it had Bluetooth but can't really complain at this price"
1,Great tablet to teach young children . Grandchildren love it to watch favorite you tube shows
1,"Echo does exactly as advertised. It will tell you the weather, jokes and some fun facts. using the skills you can add different features and for the most part they work. For it to really be big it has to continue to add features that the everyday user has an interest in. If you don't get the wording just right echo will not carry out the command. in the skills set you always have to start with a common phrase to get it to understand. This could be a pain because if you forget the exact phrase it will not work. Overall a great product well made and has great potential to be the star of the home automation."
1,Great product for online streaming. Way better than cable
1,keeps me busy great tablet I am always home bored now I am stuck on Netflix and play my games do my homework log into to work
1,Highly better alternative then the Fire Stick. Faster UI and perferomance compared to the Fire Stick.
1,"I love talking to Alexa on Amazon Echo!The set up was fast and easy to do. Just plug it in and follow the easy instructions that Alexa gives you. I loved it so much, I bought one for my brother!!"
1,"This device does everything. I get news, jokes, stock quotes, sports scores, etc. Plus it maintains my shopping list"
1,"The Amazon Fire TV is definitely one of the top media streamers on the market today. It allows for 4K playback which only a few other devices can do, ethernet port to get the most reliable streaming speed, and an expandable external storage port so you will have plenty of room for all of your apps. If you are will to pay a little extra for this it is definitely going to be worth it in the end"
1,"My first amazon tablet does not have any removable or expandable memory feature and when I saw that this product has one, I got so excited for this one. Very good display and easy to use for new users. First time tablet users will get a tutorial how to navigate the product so there is no hassle for beginners."
1,I will be buying these everyone I know! fantastic price too
1,"I ended up returning it, but it's nothing really wrong with the device itself. Despite the low specs, it was mostly responsive and pretty snappy, though I've owned better. I'm just not super invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so I was missing things that other tablets have access to, like Nook/Kobo stores, Microsoft Office, and the like. Good choice for a kid's tablet just because it's small and you won't cry much if you lose or break it."
1,"This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap."
1,"I bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. It was easy to set up. More importantly, it's easy for her to understand. I did have to create an Amazon account for her just so I could download her favorite apps. The only challenge I had was she uses Gmail for her email accounts. It took me a couple of tries to get her Gmail into the stock email app. So far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet."
1,"Have connected it to my ""smart"" home and now am able to manage lights, security and temperatures with my voice or smart phone. Mine is in kitchen and it makes a wonderful device to time cooking and baking. And it plays my music."
1,"This was a gift for my 18 year old little sister. Well worth it for the price, she really likes it"
1,This tablet is great for entertainment purposes especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. Easy to use and access to most entertainment apps make this tablet and easy purchase especially if you get it on sale for less than $50. Great buy!
1,"Ive only had one tablet before this one so its great that this tablet didnt ""lose me"" in technology and also do everything I bought it for at the same time."
1,"Purchased this for my granddaughter, she is 13 and loves it"
1,My kid love this tablet. Very good quality with affordable price.
1,"This is a great choice for kids is simple, not expensive and a great alternative."
1,"It took me a good 6 months to finally purchase one of these but now I am so glad I did! I can ask Alexa anything I would normally Google, set a timer for cooking, listen to music, etc. I've just purchased so I know there's so much more that can be done and I really look forward to learning more about the product. I've ""liked"" the Alexa FB page which gives me new things to try each day. Love this item!"
1,My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
1,Satisfied customer with product for small child. Very durable. Amazon fire rocks
1,My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
1,Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice
1,This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,great product...will buy again...like it's versility and ease of use
1,"Very fast, no buffering and better than fire stick when you use hardwired Ethernet."
1,I you're a part of the amazon world - i.e. prime. This is incredible for the price - it just works and you can add memory to the 8gb for bringing along videos if you not on the web.
1,"Very inexpensive, good size and weight to carry, added a 64 gb memory card and I have everything I need, from books to videos."
0,"My mother has the larger Amazon tablet, which prompted me to purchase this version. The tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard 7' tablet, so I returned it."
1,"I bought this as a replacement for my wife's old Kindle 3g. I got the wifi version only since she rarely used the 3g. I have to say that this version is much nicer in some ways and is lacking in others. My wife really misses the physical keyboard, but she has quickly gotten used to the touch-screen. The dpi is MUCH better, and the screen is much easier to read. The refresh times are a lot better. I don't see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently working, but you shouldn't hesitate if you're in the market for an excellent e-book reader."
1,"I just purchased this Kindle to replace my first generation kindle. I am so happy with my purchase. It is much easier to use, read, hold and charge. It is a worthwhile investment!"
1,Kids Kindle was a Christmas present for great grandson age 4. His mother has downloaded many word games and etc. from Amazon's childrens library. A big feature of the Kindle is the case and the 2 year no fault warranty. His Mother says he loves the Kindle and uses it all the time. Great purchase.
1,this equipment will help us with our viewing of movies that we want.
1,"Very happy with my purchase, found exactly what I was looking for when I walked in to the store."
1,For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
1,Its awaesome. I love it. The price is worth it to buy it.
1,"Bought this for my 5yr and she loves it. We are still learning how to work it together, but so far so good."
1,"The Amazon Echo is a really fun thing to play with. We always try to find new things to say to it which would make it say something funny. The Echo has been the most helpful in our home for creating shopping lists for everyone in the house with a phone. If any of us find ourselves at the store, we know what the others want. Shopping on Amazon is really easy and fun as well. There's a whole bunch of apps so it won't be hard for you to find what will make the Echo useful to you specifically. We love it. I couldn't recommend it more."
1,"Was considering the HD version, but realized the specs weren't very different. A good tablet for the price paid."
1,I replaced a lost e-reader on the plane with a new one.
1,Very good tablet for a beginner. Very easy to use. However wished the color on the screen was better.
1,This is a must have product for the home. ..........
1,I bought this kindle to replace my aging kindle fire 2 nd generation. Battery life is improved with new features. Display is excellent. Love having a camera. Very happy customer!!!!
1,this purchase was not for me but i decided ti purchase it for my wifeher name is rebecca.
1,I wore out my first generation paperwhite......onto the next! Kindle paperwhites are the way to go!
1,I love this Kindle. Easy to read outside in the daylight. It is much lighter than my previous version. I just ordered a new case for it.
1,Was at a family members house. This is cool so I bought one
1,"love these boxes! use them on a regular basis, would recomend"
1,We bought 2 of these for Xmas kids love them great
1,Will purchase again. Great delivery. Great customer service
1,It's great only issue is wish the o.s was more open and you could delete more of the things you dont want
1,"We had one before and it was stolen so we got another and loving it as always, great thing to have on the go or when you don't want a bunch of books all over"
1,Ny son really enjoys playing his games on his tablet. It was good purchase at a awesome price.
1,I love my kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for.
1,"To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2."
1,I own the Apple TV and I wanted to try out the Fire TV and am glad I did.
1,Christmas gift for my nieces & they absolutly loved them.....
1,"Works great, easy to setup, simple to navagate, layout and options are easily to use"
1,"I love this product - light weight, easy on the eyes, glare-free."
0,Pretty basic tablet. Lagging processor but it works.
1,Love it.. Would highly recommend. I use it everyday.
1,"This was purchased as a gift, but I now have the intention of purchasing for myself, because of how much they love it."
1,It's an amazing product I stand behind it! Good job
0,It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.
1,"I was happy with the Echo but because I'm all Google I returned and went with the Google home. As far as the Echo the speaker was really good, picked up my voice from everywhere around my apartment (google home doesn't do as good as Alexa) Its a great toy for anyone"
0,I have been a kindle user for years and I expect a certain level of quality. This version falls short. Constantly freezes.
1,Replacing my son's 5 year old computer. He love the apple products
1,my moms favortie gift of chrismas 2015. i would recommend is product over and over.
1,Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.
1,I LIKE THE FIRE TV STREAMING MEDIA PLAYER. IT WORKS WELL.
1,"Works the way it should. However I am baffled that there is no way to set up recurring reminders (aka take pills, etc)."
1,"This is a fun and helpful device. Alexa can answer almost anything you ask her; if she can't - reword your question and try again. I use her for weather, sports, music, mileage, and much more."
0,Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..
1,"Gets the job done nicely. It's as convenient as using a cell phone, but just a larger screen. Great for reading e books and catching up with shows on line."
1,I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use
1,this tablet works great and is a great price made great christmas presents
1,I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.
1,"Took a while to get one since all stores were out of stock. Ended up ordering online and getting free shipping. Has all apps plus HBO Now which is great. So far, so good!"
1,This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
1,This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
0,"I thought there would be a bigger step up from the fire stick. Honestly, if you want to save money, just go with the fire stick."
1,"great, always a great time vising the store of my choice"
1,Amazon is always producing great products for a affordable price.
1,"This tablet is really good, very much user friendly."
1,"This is actually our 2nd Echo for our house. We had one for downstairs, and this one is for upstairs. If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker, you should definitely get this as it is about the same price as other speakers, has great sound, plus you get the voice control. Alexa voice control is good for playing music, asking about the weather, adding things to a list, setting timers, etc. The only downside is that she is much more limited in her knowledge than Siri is, she can't play from iTunes or apple music, or connect to iPhone notes. It is completely Amazon and other than apple having an app, that is as far as the iPhone integration goes. Overall, a great speaker with the benefits of voice control and other features."
1,This is a good alternative for those who don't like the chromecast. Not great for plex but regular streaming and navigation are very good.
1,"I bought this to control lights and play music from pandora, Amazon prime and phone. Works very well. Alexa response is acceptable but not as good as 'Okay Google'"
1,Bought for kids and really they enjoying. Size is small but compact for kids
1,If you don't have cable this is a good thing to have. Great product. & you can even jail break it.
1,"My previous tablets have been androids, so I don't care for the navigation on the home page. It has take some getting used to. However, it's nice to have an actual Kindle when I read my books, as opposed to just the app."
1,"I was first introduced to this product by a friend and ever since I had seen what it is capable of, I not only bought one, but two! I have referred this device to several family members along with friends and they all agreed how impressive it is."
1,"Nice ereader for reading books. Browser should be improved otherwise fine for reading books, another irritating part is ads pop up which amazon shud fix"
1,"So, I pretty much got this as a cheap tablet for my 2 year old. He's constantly snagging people's cell phones to play games. We figured this was inexpensive enough that if he breaks out in the next two years, it's still better than if he breaks one of our phones on contact. Overall, it's a great little tablet for the money, and we can set parental controls on it so it can grow with him over the next few years. Not bad."
1,"The Fire TV is easy to hookup and easy to use. Lots of apps. Alexa is fun and useful for programming questions, weather and controlling some of my smart home lights. The request would be to control TV volume on the remote."
1,Bought as a gift seems to be very easy-to-use and portable light weight too
1,"I've done everything with Alexa from Pandora, the Nest thermostat and iheart. Getting one more for when we go to El Salvador."
1,"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
1,Bought this for my twelve year old grandson to replace his two year old Kindle Fire. He loved the blue color and said it was like his friends mini pad.
1,"Can't complain for the price of it on sale it does what it should at the speed that is appropriate,"
1,"I bought this tablet for my son. He damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. He loves to play the Minecraft app and can read a book with ease. I don't have a tablet for myself. If I did, I would get the Fire. All I would really need it for would be to surf the Web and use the apps. For the price, u can't go wrong."
1,"I bought this tablet for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! He reads pdf's from work on this tablet and can easily study with it. He says it doesn't hurt his eyes and I couldn't have purchased a better gift for him. If you're thinking about it, go for it and get it! I got a pretty good deal on it, $100!!"
1,"I really enjoy my Alexa. I use it for news briefs, listening to music and a playing games"
1,Good little tablet. But I don't like that there is not a big choice of apps.
1,"Had one of these 2 years ago, got this one on sale and I usually pay more for a dinner. Does everything you need and plus you can expand the memory."
1,PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
1,Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase.
1,"I never thought I'd be an e-reader person, always preferred a paper book. I am dyslexic and decided to try out this Kindle at the recommendation of a friend. I LOVE IT! I've read more books since I bought it last month than I have in years! Reasons it is perfect for dyslexics: You can change the font size, line spacing, margins, and the actual font. The last reason is the best. Recently Amazon added the Open Dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! The next best option I found is Helvetica. Another thing that I like about the Paperwhite is that it has a matte screen, not a LED one like most electronic devices. It eliminates eye strain and the ""blue light"" issues at night. I also love that our library has the ability to borrow e-books, which has helped me save money on the books."
1,Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price!
1,Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book
1,I really enjoy my kindle easy to download books and easy to read on the beach
1,I'm able to screen mirror from my tablet and android.
1,This is my first tablet. I has been fun learning how to use it. Great price.
1,"Works smoothly, no problems. Amazin has a great selection of tv shows and movies."
1,"Solid unit for reading and the occasional TV show or game.Those coming from a full featured tablet may find themselves frustrated at some of the limitations and quirks of Amazon's walled garden, but if your are looking for something cheap they does what it says on the box, you can't go wrong."
1,I really enjoy my tablet. It does everything that I was looking for in a tablet. Easy to use and small.
1,"I am still learning what it will do so far very pleased when I ask it something it answers, I played Christmas music all day long and was pleased"
1,I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt
1,it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price
1,"Had a kindle before, needed new one. Like the size"
1,my son has been using our computer and we got him this and he never looked back.
1,This tablet is very reasonably priced for children and I love the insurance replacements. Must have for the young ones.
1,This charger is improved from the other one I had. It takes less time to fully charge and the charge lasts longer.
1,This box is better then the fire stick I can finally look at 4K movies with this box then I could look on the fire stick and it handles my internet very well which is 5.0ghz wifi no problem
1,"I found this device was easy to hook up, also easy to navagate perfect box for beginners and advanced users"
1,Easy set up. Great features. Can't beat the price.
1,"Amazons's ECHO is everything good you might have heard - as long as you are a $100 a year Prime member but, why wouldn't you with all it has to offer."
1,Bought this on black Fri. Great tablet for the price.
1,Love it! Easy to navigate! Even my toddler can do it!
1,"This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
1,Awesome product! If you enjoy reading this is a must have.
1,We love our new echo. I'm sure as time goes on it will just. Keep getting better with updates.
0,"When companies play nice with each other... the customers win. This product is fairly novel if you aren't completely bought in to the Amazon ecosystem. I would use it way more if they played nice with Apple services. I know it's a competitor, but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer, they should play nice."
1,This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life.
1,"My experience with Alexa it's been pretty good ,the grandkids love to ask questions as she have an answer for each and everyone."
1,I love traveling so this has been perfect for taking books wherever I go.
1,"The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes."
1,"Quick Easy setup, fun & We use it all the time! Checking our commute, weather, jokes, recipes, to helpful to mention it all!"
1,Overall the Amazon echo Alexa is a phenomenal product but will grow much more with time. There are a few issues but that's to be expected!
1,Takes a while to get data programmed so you don't get a lot of I don't understand
1,i bought them for my grand kids.they will enjoy them ask for a computer for christmas
1,Does what it says it does and is small and convenient!
1,Love all the options with the Fire TV. A lot of games and apps to help stop cable.
1,"I bought this tablet for a Christmas for a family member gift even thought I wasn't too sure of the quality of this tablet because it was very inexpensive. The person who received the tablet was very satisfied with the speed, screen resolution and apps."
1,Very good for what I wanted it for. Great speaker.
0,"I can't return through Best Buy, because it's over 15 days. Started out ok, but then it just stopped working. It keeps freezing at home screen and I can't access anything. Extremely disappointed."
1,I love this echo. It's literally one of my favorite gifts that I purchased for my family. We love how it understands very well and does almost exactly what we say. Whenever I forget something for food shopping I literally ask Alexa to put it in my cart and it does just that! It's the perfect little helper around the house. Just what I needed!
1,"Gave this as a gift. My friend liked the tablet and it is pretty inexpensive. The only problem is that flixster app is no longer available/compatible with Amazon so, she is not able to watch movies she owns on flixster."
1,This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
0,"Bought this for my nephew. The price is right, however, the tablet is terrible. Spend the money and get an iPad."
1,it's and super cool device for music streaming. it's also voice activated.
1,"This is really the best streaming device it has all the services like netflix, hulu, and it also plays games. I love this fire tv. Its also 4k."
1,My son bought this with his own money during Black Friday. It was his 4th Kindle Fire. Definitely an upgrade from his previous generation model. I love the durability and extended ability to accept a larger sd card. Screen is notably better. He travels with me on work trips and having an Amazon Prime and Netflix account for this thing makes it the perfect travel companion.
1,I love having Alexa around. When you have your hands full you can still get information or set a timer without having to empty your hands or wash the meatloaf off first. I can't wait to see what all she can do.
1,"I am so happy I chose the Echo over the Google. Clear sound, listens better than google. More knowledgable than google, answers all questions correctly."
0,They are ok for a kid to play games on. But I don't like it for myself. I will just save for an iPad.
1,Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids
1,Very easy setup via smartphone App. Easy to use. Like the shopping list feature.
1,"I love this paper white! It's light weight, easy to use, and the battery lasts for a very long time with use. I only wish it were cheaper, but the price wasn't bad."
0,This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.
1,This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.
1,This is my second kindle. The first one stopped holding a charge. I don't know if that is a problem with the Kindle or not but I still love my Kindle.

1,My daughter absolutely loves this tablet! It has a lot of great apps that she can choose from in the app store too. She's had no problems with her tablet. I've even had fun using her tablet and it's simple to use.

1,"Perfect for my needs. Really enjoy it, easy to use."
1,"The Fire Stick runs nicely on the bedroom TV, and I have the Fire Box setup on the main TV."
1,great buy for the price. Very vanilla and a little small but you cant beat the price for a beginners tablet or a cheap replacement.
1,"Great tablet for the price. Got it on sale for $39. To my surprise, it has bluetooth."
1,I love this it was the best thing I brought My kids even love it and it easy for or them to use
1,I was familiar with the previous paperwhite lower res product that was fine. For the price it is a great reader. The new higher res standing side by side is an improvement. Would recommend.
1,Very easy to use set up was really use I love all of the channels
0,This tablet is okay for moderate use. Mine tends to lag while playing games or surfing the internet..
1,great- easy to set up- great gift item- small and fits in purse!
1,Nice price drop to $139.00. Admittedly a device that makes your prime membership much more sticky but love accessing prime music through it
1,Great product! Easy integration with Samsung Smartthings hub and music apps such as Spotify. It also delivers great sound with the size of the speaker.
1,This works well for those that like movies! I personally appreciate the ease of use.
1,I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter and she loves it! This is a great and inexpensive item for a young child.
1,Bday gift for my 10 year old. He loves it! And the price was perfect.
1,My family love it and y husband is crazy with this
1,I use my echo to play my music and control my hue lights which works difficult to understand at first;but not more than a 15 minutes can't solve.
1,Its great love to watch my favorite shows and read books
1,Bought for my wife. Great product. Easy to set up and use.
1,"Simple, everything works no problems. We bought for my mother in law . She loves it."
1,I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
1,Fast and responsive. Well worth the price for the convenience.
0,20 for a USB charger is outrageous! It should have bee free with the Paperwhite Kindle.
1,Excellent little tablet for reading books when you're on the go.
1,Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.
1,Really great item to have and would definitely recommend it
1,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader."
1,Easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issues
1,"Great product. She seems like her favorite answers right now are I'm not sure about that, but I know it has a lot of great features"
1,"Great starter to teach young children how to play games with parental control of what game,movie or music sites. And the plastic protector case is included"
1,I had been reading on my iPad mini but I was scared it would damage it carry it around. This is perfect!!
1,Bought this as a gift for a child. They love it for playing games and watching videos.
1,This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.
1,I love Alexa and that lady knows everything. I have even hooked up some more functions to her.
1,"Alexa (AKA, Amazon Echo) Is A Complete And Absolutely Awesome Addition To My House And Home Automation, I've Even Brought Additional Smart Home Items For Her To Play With!!! Love That She's Always Learning.... Alexa Is Wroth The Investment!"
1,A very nice gift for all. My mother loves it. Super
1,My wife's old kindle stopped holding a charge. So to surprise her I stopped by my local best buy and picked up this kindle. This kindle is great. Its has a display that rivals my samsung tablet pro and has a long battery life. My wife uses it every day. This is great for any book worm or if your looking for a tablet on a budget.
1,"This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability"
1,"This was a Christmas present for my daughter, she reads big books very fast. When we bought the Kindle Paperwhiye we signed up for the Amazon Prime now she reads up to 5 books a week."
1,"I bought two one for my 5 year old and one for my grandmother. So easy to use, and they love it. Will buy more"
1,Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
1,Got it for 35 bucks for my son and he loves it so I'm happy
1,Lightning fast no but still a great and inexpensive way to get the latest book release and maybe to check the news. Price was unbeatable
1,Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
1,The echo sounds great music fills up the room. Makes life easier answers your questions turns lights on and off weather news her skills are endless. I love it
1,Great for adults and kids!!! No need to be tech savvy with the Echo. Works Great and easy to use!!!!
1,"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended."
1,"The product works very well, but the user interface is too busy and not really tunable. It is also difficult to search for new apps that aren't already listed. Voice control works okay, but Alexa remains a far cry from Siri."
1,"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did."
1,"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
1,"What a time we live in...Jetsons are real, this is a must have."
1,"This has been great for travelling. I can read and watch tv/movies, and not have to take out my computer. The price sealed the deal."
1,Just learning all the features this product is capable of providing
1,"Kindle Paperwhite strikes a nice balance between features and price. Amazon offers the best store for eBooks period. If you are looking to bring your reading hobby to the 21st century, you cannot go wrong."
1,My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere!
1,I love this product! My home automation is wonderful to be controlled by voice.
1,"The paper white screen is super clear and easy on the eyes, making reading a pleasure in any light. The touch controls are intuitive and easy to learn. Books load fast. The battery life has been great! If you're looking for an eBook, this is it."
1,Good!
1,Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use
1,"I got this tablet for my godson who loves videos, didn't want to spend to much and this was the perfect tablet for the price $33, great product great price."
1,I bought one of these tablets for my 5 year old son and he loves it. Very user friendly and many options of games and apps for free at Amazon.
1,The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
1,My wife loves it
1,My kids are able to use this quite well. Can easily update all the applications.
1,Best device for Kodi. Works perfetly no issues at all
1,"Life battery very good , search engine very good.very fast."
1,"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range."
1,"I bought this as a gift for my friend. I personally own 1 Alexa and 3 echo dots. This product is excellent, easy set up and easy to use. I would recommend this product over google home for one Alexa was the first to come out with this and a lot of tweeks and updates are posted in the email. I have my kitchen lights hooked up to Alexa and can use by dimming out my lights. Hope you will enjoy your Alexa as well as I did mine."
1,"I am very happy with this tablet. It was an upgrade from the Kindle paperwhite. The screen is very sharp, and the tablet is very lite."
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite has many improvements over my first Kindle with a lighted touch screen, wifi, and ability to swipe to turn the page. I love it!"
1,Could never get into reading from a tablet like the iPad or even the Amazon kindle fire. It just didn't feel right. This device makes it feel as if you're reading actual paper print. It's amazing. I highly recommend it if your an avid reader.
1,My kids love their new tablets and it was a great price.
0,"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
1,"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
1,Love it I download all of my audiobooks on my tablet
1,this was great for my wife who just needed a basic tablet for web browsing and media consumption.
1,My kids love the product. Really durable after drops.
1,"I wanted a replacement comparable to my original, and this filled the bill."
1,Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.
1,"Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
1,I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.
1,Great with the speaker adds good sound to the other features
1,"This is my 4th Fire tablet. They're so affordable, I buy them and end up giving them away to family members."
1,Trying to find a tablet to teach my father in law on who not tech savvy and it's perfect
1,Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
1,"I bought the Kindle Fire mostly for use as an MP3. As a Black Friday deal of only $24.99, couldn't beat it. So far, it is working great as an MP3. I was able to download songs and playlists from my computer. Purchasing games and books have also been easy."
1,It was a gift to each of my children (3) for anniversaries/birthdays. They all love it for variety of movies and ease of setup and use. No complaints.
0,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
1,"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
1,I got it for my kids and they love it they are always playing with it
1,"This is my second Echo purchase. I use ""Alexa"" while getting ready in the morning. Instead of looking for a clock, I ask ""Alexa"" for the time 20 times in the morning.I use the Echo to set alarms, and to listen to news/music. The Echo can also play books via Audible. Oh! I also use my Echo to control my lights. Buy the Echo. It's usefulness is endless."
1,"Echo is very impressive. Unlimited entertainment. and is pretty decent speaker for music, spotify premium is awesome to use with it."
1,Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.
1,"This has a real loud sound, Alexa can turn off your light or play some music from your phone!"
1,Good basic tablet for home and the kids. The only downside is that a credit/ debit card is required to link to the Amazon store even if you download a free app. I'm able to let the kids use apps and the Internet. I can limit the sites the kids can visit and apps they can use.
1,"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device."
1,I bought this for my son who has a speech disability. He uses it to communicate as well as play games. Great parental controls
1,I bought this Echo as a gift. I have had mine for about a year. The abilities of the echo device are constantly being improved.
1,"Being that I am already an Amazon prime member, I decided to purchase this to make use of Amazon video. I replaced my Chromecast with the Fire TV and couldn't be happier"
1,Easy to use. I would recommend to others! Have friends who will buy one!
1,Essentially it works well for its intended purpose
1,"Our family enjoys our Amazon tv box, it's great expecially with the free movies and TV shows. I like the remote design better than the apple tv box, but that's just my opinion. It's a great addition to any tv because it makes searching and watching whatever you want effortless."
1,This tablet is very easy to use i bought it for my nephew and he's only 4 years old and he love it
1,"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light."
1,"Purchased for my wife so she can play games and not tie up her phone. Seems to play her games alright. It is a bit slow when opening things like the Internet, Facebook or Netflix. Still a decent little tablet for $39.99. Also limited to Amazon app store, so a lot of Android apps are not available (like dice with buddies)."
1,"Mainly use it for playing music, was going to connect to Apple Music, but found it much easier to use amazon music and amazon offers a lower priced plan if you just use amazon music for Alexa. I have an outlet switch connected which is convenient for turning on/off lights. It has a good speaker for playing music. I think Alexa is comparable to Siri."
1,Great Tablet for the price and works really well... Cannot go wrong with this Tablet
0,"It's nice for the price, nice gift for kids and grandparents"
1,This tablet is for our 9 year old grandson. It works out great for him to play games on.
1,I've been hemming and hawing about what eReader to buy for a while. This does everything I need a ebook to do.
1,Awesome product fully functional with my home theater and overall feel of my living room. good for playing music off spotify
1,"Excellent reader. We have Amazon Prime and access to a number of books with Amazom. Plus we utilize our local library. This paperwhite is excellent for reading at anytime. Good battery life.If you only need a reader, you can not buy a better one. If you want more, look at the Kindle Fire tablet. Good price."
1,This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
1,My wife loves it. She has been using the unit since she received it for a gift.
1,This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!
1,"I'm a big reader and love to read on the go! This makes it possible. It's light, and super portable and goes everywhere with me."
1,"So fun, I can play all kinds of music and even my fave radio station out of Los angeles. Ask her anything!"
1,"I love the ability to just say what song I want to hear and Alexa plays it, or stops immediately when I instruct her to. The jokes and pick up lines are a crowd favorite as well."
1,"Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa"
1,Seems like a great tablet for my youngest daughter. The parental controls are nice and the battery life seems decent too.
1,"My kids love this tablet. There are over hundreds of games, books, and shows to pick from"
1,Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.
1,No cheaper reader on the market. Great value. Good product.
1,"Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house."
1,"I love my Echo. I use it mostly for music but it doesn't everything I need it to! It's also very handy in the kitchen for things like timers, recipes and measurements"
1,"Very easy setup, takes maybe 10 minutes to connect to wifi, Bluetooth and complete the setup. We don't have a lot of the smart home equipment to really utilize all the Echo's features but works really well for getting weather, news, recipes, playing games and listening to music."
1,"Bought this to cut the cable cord! Works better than I imagined, highly recommend it!"
1,great device so far. still learning new features on it daily
1,I love it. I enjoy playing games and reading on it.
1,"Love my Echo! I brought it home and started playing with it. I had Alexa playing music, setting alarms, getting weather information. I have begun to rely on Alexa for a number of things. So glad I made this purchase."
1,I love that I can talk to it and get an answerI have recommended to my sister. now we can send a message to each
0,"It should be easier.to print off highlights and have a choice not.to have every location and other stuff printing with every highlight.It should be easier to erase ""All"" highlights.Regular book numbers should correlate with location.Easier.to.forward.through chapters."
1,My Kindle Fire is much better than my previous Kindle. Works well in bright day light and user friendly. Access to books and downloading is more streamlined with this device. I'd not hesitate to buy again for myself or as a gift.
1,Live the ease of use. Recommended for anybody that has Amazon and isn't a fan of goggle.
1,I got this for sister's son who is enjoying it so far with the apps and games.
1,I bought 2 fires for my children and they were a great purchase. They aren't expensive and they are easy to maunuver through even for kids. They love them.
1,Our youngest mostly uses it for games. Easy to navigate
1,This is the best tablet I have ever purchased. Very easy to operate
1,Love the Fire box! Saves us tons on TV. Love all the Apps.

1,This is my 4th Kindle and my 1st from Best Buy. It was much easier to purchase on line and pick up at the store a short time later.
1,Love the kindle product have purchased several kindles and several types and this is another great product. this model doesnt have the auto dimming feature that i like on previous model but still a great kindle
1,"I had purchased a tablet for my son as s Christmas gift and he loved it, he let me use it and I loved it, especially since I have problems with my hands. This tablet proved to be the best thing for me. My experience with Best Buy is the best choice I could make on my tablet. The staff is fantastic, they helped me to get the basics down pat, you can add me to your list of return consumers."
1,Great tablet for the price. Good size. Easy to use.
1,"Superb value for the price I paid. I can stream video easily, and read ebooks with ease."

1,I love my kindle fire I downloaded books easy . Thank god for that !
1,Great Speed. Nice Graphics. Really love this Fire.
1,"I had the first gen kindle and this is soooo much better. Screen looks better, the front and back camera is cool, the side control buttons are convenient and so far the tablet works great. It was an easy setup and transfer from my Amazon acct. I bought it originally for my 4 yr old so the parental controls are great too."
1,Like to have in house. It makes life easier and no need to browse internet
1,"The Kindle Voyage is light weight, slim. easy to use and so far has been a good product. The page turns very easily and the light works very well. The anti glare screen is the best!"
0,I am an old guy and I am having trouble trying to get the unit up and running. I decided I really should return it but it was past the return date. It is back in the box waiting to find time to try one more time or put it on ebay.
1,this item is great does not take any space plus has some great features.
1,"Hooked up my tv, speakers, lights and cameras to Alexa!"
1,Great streaming box to watch anything from the internet.

1,Works great and holds a charge forever. Looks as if I'm actually reading from paper.
1,If you want to save money and cut your cable bill this is the way to go.I am now saving over $80 a month because of all the stations that I get now on Amazon Fire Tv.
1,The product works great as of now. It arrived as promised
1,This tablet is just the right size.. my baby was ale to use it on plane. But i would recommend a bumper if you buy for kids.
1,I have several of these tablets and they are still my favorite compared to my expensive IPad. Best buy ships pretty fast and I am pleased with their online store.
1,Wonderful tablet for the kids. It comes in nice colors and has so many nice features.
1,Awseome tablet for kids. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
1,Easy to set up and works great with hue lighting!!

1,great value at #35 . great for a kids tablet. you dont worry about kids breaking an expensive tablet
1,"We bought this tablet primarily to use the kindle reader. The layout is muddy and things are a bit hard to navigate. Once you figure it out, it isn't bad. Not an iPad, obviously, but definitely worth the low price."
1,"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
1,I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
1,This product far exceeded my expectations. I've had no issues thus far in regards to video quality.
1,"this thing works great. it was simple to set up and has great sound. all of my Amazon prime music is available. we keep it downstairs where we watch tv so it is available. Now we need a ""spot"" for the kitchen. Set a timer, put items on the grocery list Etc."
1,"Love the product, but was not aware that I would have to spend $8.00 a month to play most of the music I like to listen to."
1,"I bought that for my parents. Great product, easy to operate, they love it. Also great price, thank you, Best buy."
1,The sound is really good for a portable speaker. I have 2 dots but use this one in the living room to listen to music.
1,This tablet works very well and the price is excellent. I bought for my nephew and he is so happy.
1,I am so happy with the Kindlefire. I bought the first generation Kindlefire & I was happy with it. When I bought this new Kindlefire I was happily & surprised at how much better this version is. I use the Kindlefire mainly for watching movies & reading books. So.happy with it :)
1,nice pickup for my wife who is just learing to use a tablet
1,"Don't let the summary fool you; the reason this is the third one is because of the quality! I've bought one for myself, one for my son-in-law, and I bought this as a replacement for my mother, who uses it to read books in her tiny apartment. The Kindle Fire is extremely user-friendly, and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive but reliable tablet."
1,great reader for bed or the beach. definitely a must pack on vacation.
1,I like the size! The screen is perfect for my online reading textbooks for school!
1,The picture looks better running netflix on this than apple tv.
1,Wow what a tablet my girls are have the time of their lives. Hey it was a little learning in the beginning but once they got it the rest was history.
1,Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!
1,"I was not expecting much with this product, but man I was surprised how well it worked. I added the charter app and I am able to watch live tv on it."
1,"I love the Fire Kindle/tablet. This is my 3rd kindle, 2nd Fire. The new Fire is so much easier to use as a tablet plus nothing beats a kindle for reading books. This Fire is much easier to use than my husband's Samsung tablet"
1,I have a kindle paperwhite 2 before and just updated my machine. The recent machine presents much more clear and reaches 300 ppi. Besides the price is much more welcome
1,"I love it, I like to use to relax after coming from job"
1,I got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. She enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. Everything rolled into one for her.
1,It's continent for my son but is too slow to connect to wifi
1,Features that i never thought I would be interested.
1,Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
1,Works as expected. Very easy to use and does not hurt my eyes like a tablet would.
1,Great to have my entire library with me and no I can read in bed with the backlight also.
1,Purchased this for my 5 yr old son. I had previously purchased 2 other tablets for him (both different brands) and they both went out within a year. He loves his tablet. He is able to play his ABC mouse and watch Netflix. Easy for him to navigate. I am going to purchase the 16g for myself.
1,Bought the fire for both my grandkids. They love being able to surf the web and play games.
1,I gave this to my 3 yr old to play games and watch movies. My TV's have been reclaimed!
1,It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!
1,"Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting."
1,I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
1,Great product for the money. My family and I are enjoying it.
1,I absolutely love my fire tv. it works so well and offers so many different things to watch. I will never need cable again. it loads fast and I would recommend these to anyone who will listen!
0,"Purchased Amazon Fire TV due to previous reviews stating that it performs fast with PlayStation Vue. Tried it out for a month and all it did was constantly buffer. Checked my internet speed and router/modem and I have the fastest 1GB speed available. Reviews on PlayStation Vue state that Roku interface is not as good, so I purchased Amazon Fire Stick to determine if it has better performance. Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Extremely fast and no buffering with online streaming with PlayStation Vue on the Amazon Fire Stick. Save your money and get the stick."
1,it is easy for him to use. It has all the apps. that he wanted and can add more.
1,Decent tablet for the price. Economic tablet for easy browsing.
1,Really enjoy talking to Alexa. It's great to not have to look up things on the computer and so easy to just ask questions or listen to music
1,"I had been looking for something to watch my Amazon Prime and this gives me an easy way to do it plus Netflix, HBO and more. Easy plug and go makes it good to move from room to room easily"
1,Excellent machine for children. Easy to use and download.
1,Capable to run games just as spected and very handly
1,I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.
1,"This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more"
1,"Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case."
1,I am loving my Amazon Fire Tv because it gave me the freedom to only pay for what I watch which was one of the things that really bugged me with cable tv. I used to have hundreds of channels available but also paying hundreds of dollars for them and with the Fire TV I just spend the dollar amount that I want.
1,Worked as expected.
1,I bought it for my media room it is great!! Faster than the previous version
1,easy to use. works great when you have an Amazon account
1,"I'm so happy to bought it, i will buy two more soon"
1,i haven't been able to use it a lot yet. for now only use for music.
1,For the money best Bang for your buck....Really great if you subscribe to amazon prime.
1,This is a great low end tablet and it is sold at an amazing price.
1,I love this Fire for kids. It even comes with the bumper cover. Great buy.
1,Great gift !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This item is one of the sweetest things I have ever brought.
0,"Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me."
1,"I bought one Fire TV just to test out ""cutting the cable"" and start streaming TV. I was so impressed with Amazon's Fire TV that I bought a second one for the bedroom. Small, easy to setup, full featured and fast."
1,Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
0,Not a big reader but gave it to someone that is. She is happy so I think that should make me happy.time will tell
1,These were great gifts for the grandkids!! They were easy for them to use and now they are almost as good as the adults on them!
1,"Nice size, very clear video. Lots of great apps! Excellent price."
1,"Fire TV is good except I have to reboot it more than should be necessary. It drops its network connection too often. Rather than reentering my password, I find it easier to just unplug it for a few seconds. Once, the remote became unresponsive . The fix: remove the batteries then put them right back in. Updates should correct these matters."
1,Meets all advertised items in the software. Easy to down load books and screen quality is very pleasant.
1,"With these being on sale for $33, we couldn't pass up the deal. These tabletd are perfect for younger kids."
1,"I've had a Kindle since they first came out and was happy to get one with a backlit screen. I like the WiFi and the 3G because I like the freedom of downloading books and newspapers while in the car, at the beach, by the pool when another guest recommends a new book. I still haven,t figured out some of the buttons, and because it is smaller I am always turning the page. I have adjusted the font and how far apart the lines are, but it still seems like I'm doing more page turning."
1,This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
1,"Love the Fire TV. It is fast and reliable. I have all my movies, tv shows and apps in one place."
1,It could be a couple of square inches bigger but its great. Ability to adjust background light is fantastic.
1,"Thank you, the Fire works great!! My daughter is on it all the time, and I can regulate what she looks at."
1,My son's love these things. Great price and works for me.
0,my gesr fit heart monitor was not compatible with android level
1,It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connects easily to WiFi and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.
1,Very nice tablet for the price and great for kids.
1,Great product the entire family enjoys it. Works without any problems.
1,Bought a firestick and the box the same day. The box has larger memory so I don't have to worry about clearing my cache as often.
1,This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
1,What a great price and very easy to use.Had a little trouble getting past my secured connection though.
1,got for a great deal bought 2 for the kids and they love them.
0,"Purchased Blue unit - parenthesis below is error correction for that review since BB does not allow edit. Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising/purchasing and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account, (*which is linked to and displays any saved credit card/payment data associated with your account. Not very private or secure in my opinion.*) All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need."
1,Love my Kindle! It's perfect for my Netflix obsession late at night! Great size and picture quality!
1,This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.
1,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Best Buy had them on sale so it was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events"
1,Small enough to carry with me. I love how the pages turn with just a touch to the screen and I love the lit up background.
1,"After purchasing 2 different ""brand X"" charges at a lower cost, and having both of them fail after a couple weeks of use, I purchased this OEM charger (made by Amazon) for our Kindle Fire. Not only does it work well (continuously) but it fully charges the unit in a matter of 2 hours, instead of overnight charging being required. Still works great, and well worth the few dollars extra in price!"
1,Great speaker but u have to have amazon prime to hear songs @ random was unaware so I gave 4 stars 4 that reason over all great sound
1,Very happy with my new tablet. Everything is assessible and easy to find. Great pic quality. My 10 year old loves it and has taken ownership of it which shows how easy it is to use.
1,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy ."
1,"Works well, loud, and constant updates.Helpful for home automation products like hue lights."
0,"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
1,"It was a Wonderful gift for the holidays, I've enjoyed it greatly!!"
1,"Great item, this is very useful and it is hard to come by."
1,Bought this for my younger sister. She's 9 and uses it to stream Netflix and play games. She tells me it's fantastic
1,"I LOVE the Amazon Echo, it's everything I expected and more"
1,Love it! I didn't think I would use it but it turns out I use it all the time!
1,The best working tablet under $50 I have ever used.
1,"works, that is all that counts"
0,I don't read the books. I'm still learning about it. I don't really even use it.
1,The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation. An annoyance but not a deal breaker.
1,"Excellent Tablet for beginners and kids. The cameras and expandable memory are a big plus and this tablet is a steal at the price. Its not for everyone, you get what you pay for"
1,Fantastic streaming device with plenty of options. Love the voice controlling remote!
1,This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc.
1,"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
1,The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
1,It's work very well for a child got for my 8 year old she love it
1,This was a present for my father and he hasn't complained one bit about it.
1,My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her
1,"Great streaming device with a lot of options to watch, highly recommended and super easy to install and use"
1,Purchased tab for my kids and they love it thus far. They play games on it and it works great.
0,"i bought two fire tv boxes and both of them have problems, the problem is that the remote suddenly stops working and then it comes back and works, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to start working. That never happen with the roku"
1,Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
1,Another great product from amzon. My daughter has nothing but great things to say about it.
1,Can't believe how much fun we have had with our new echo. Love all the music we can listen too so quickly.
1,Since I bought my Echo I have bought 3 others as gifts and at least 10 other people that I showed mine to went and bought one as well.This is a real look into the future of information and control
1,"My soul purpose for buying this item was to read which I am completely satisfied for it, howevef, the camera quality isn't of great quality"
1,It seems to work just like any other usb plug in charger.
1,Perfect for emailing and reading books online. Battery lasts a long tine.
0,Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
1,Love the fact that you can ask questions and get your answer quickly.
1,Would have liked more features for the money paid..
1,This is the box you want for 4k. If not get the regular stick.
1,Very satisfied so far. Easy to use and great price
1,"My 2 year old broke the first one. Best buy replaced it with no problems, their warranty is the best."
1,Transitioning away from standard tv and this worked great!
1,"Love, Love, Love, my hubby absolutely loves his new Kindle fire. Great picture and easy to use."
1,Excellent speakers and great voice control... I'm very happy with my alexia
1,i have not had any issues with it. i like the separate profiles so i can use it too with out him getting online. plus i can down load a app and if it is suitable for him i can add it to his profile.
0,I like it small lightweight easy to see wifi capabilities
1,My wife loves it since she is home alone in the day time
1,"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
1,Enjoy using my fire tv I have taken it out of town and it hook up just fine
1,"Great to use for a daily use, easy to use and light and great to watch movies."
1,"This is a great tablet for an affordable price. Has most of the functionality you would get with a high-end tablet with expandable memory. Access your books, browse web, email, etc. Nice screen resolution, no issues with it thus far"
1,Outstanding I love this device highly recommend it for anybody and everyone user-friendly
1,I love my Alexa! I am learning new applications every day.I really like listening to NPR news and to classical music. I have ordered plugs for light control. I am sure I will get into more smart home apps in the future.
1,This is a great quality reader. Print on it is very clear and it is easy to use.
1,My Fire Kindle is wonderful and I use it all the time.
1,Bought this for my daughter-in-law she was getting headaches from her last e reader. She loves the light on this paper white.
1,"I use it frequently and have enjoyed watching shows. I would have given it a perfect score, but not all of my shows are on it."
1,Upgraded from a galaxy tablet that was 4 years old. So worth it.
1,Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs
1,"Best streaming device out there, very fast and responsive. A bit more than fire stick but very well worth it!"
1,Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
1,This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.
1,"Really enjoying this baby kindle! My first experience with a Kindle product. Fits in my purse even in folio. Recommend a stylus. Having fun loading it up with books, videos, music, and apps. Use it for email and facebook, internet searches, etc. I don't have a smart phone so this is really handy. And, hey, it has TWO cameras, too!!! For $50--UNBELIEVABLE!!! At this price, I could have one in every room of my house!"
1,I love the load up speed there on great and a great way to enjoy netflix
1,"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but its great for entertainment."
1,Works very well as long as you have good internet speed. Saves us a lot of money not paying for satellite.
1,Bought it when it was 50 percent off. Good product.
1,i am very pleased with this purchase. Thank you BB
1,"I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience."
1,I spend more money taking my family out to dinner for a night than I spent on this wonderful little thing. I picked up a rubber guard and screen protector from another big box retailer and have a perfect tablet for my two-year-old for less than 70 bucks. This tablet has a kids profile mode which makes it perfect for your little one but also all the apps and great Amazon accessibility for the adults. I took a star off for the tiny amount of internal memory which gets used up extremely quickly so I would definitely recommend a micro SD card and making sure you change the settings to store your apps on the card and not be internal memory. Otherwise no complaints and several places on the Internet will tell you how to use another big-name App Store to download your favorites.
1,"Good capabilities good sound, quick responses. Good amount of applications which respond quickly."
1,Quick and easy to install and simple to use my 6yr old knows how to work it
1,I am so glad I purchased these. We can get all of our favorite movies!!!!
1,"Always wanted to read more and I am with Kindle Voyage. This version rocks all previous versions. The side lit screen, smooth resolution, ultra lightweight in hand feel, and more make this the kindle that's perfect to me."
1,The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
1,"I owned a first generation kindle (that was shaped like a book, with one side wider and heaver to mimic a spine, BTW) when they first came out. Then I owned a kindle 2, which really didn't improve much except on the physical shape and memory. But this one is a huge improvement. Having the back-lit display is completely awesome. I thought I was going to miss a physical keyboard but I definitely don't. If you have a non-backlit kindle, I'd definitely recommend this one. Also, I've played with my friend's Voyager, and I definitely don't think it's worth the extra price for what you get."
1,"I had a 7 inch kindle hd tablet. I wanted a larger screen so I purchased the 10 inch kindle. I am very happy with the device. I surf the web, play some games, read books, and process my email."
1,"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
1,Son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. Nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. No questions asked.
1,Perfect for my house. Its a space saver for me plus its various features just are value adds to my reading.
1,Great eReader for the price. Amazon Prime member. I use eReader when I travel.
1,This is a fine tablet for $49. A bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for $49 it isn't bad.
1,I am surprised that they could sell this tablet for so low considering it's quality. It's not the best tablet by a long shot but I haven't had many complaints for the price. The apps and OS run very well; not sluggish like one may think. The screen and sound quality isn't super HD but it's acceptable.
1,couldn't go wrong with the amazon tablet for $50 best deal there is only at Best Buy!
1,I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
1,Great value. My kids love it and use it often. Really helps them with homework.
0,The only thing that I didn't like was that I had to sign up with Amazon Prime in order for my son to get unlimited games. I ended up paying a little bit more.
1,"This is a great buy - and especially for the price. Use it every day. Screen is great, features good. Highly recommend it."
1,I absolutely love the Echo. It works great with home automation devices. I love how I can use it with Pandora.
1,Love it ... need to get some smart appliances! I also got the Echo dot - wish I got these items sooner
1,"Amazon already includes this cable with the Kindle Fire 7, the Kindle Fire HD 7 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's also great to purchase as a back up for the office or to take with you on the go. For the peace of mind knowing Amazon designed this to work specifically with Kindle Fire, it's worth the price.The quality of this cable compared to the previous white USB cable is much better. This cable has a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better. Data transfer speeds between the computer and the device are relatively quick. This cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be 5 ft. in length. Measuring both cables, the black cable is approx 5 ft. and the white cable is approx 5 ft. 9in. Overall, even though it is shorter, this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable."
1,Perfect I love it glad I did my homework before purchasing best choice for a reader
1,I had a non-background light kindle before. Now I replace it with the Kindle paperwhite. Good as expected.
1,I love my Echo that I received for Christmas from my wife that I bought it for my son in law for his birthday. He has Amazon prime so he can do much more with the Echo. I will be subscribing also.
1,I love this box. Better than the firestick by far.
1,I have purchased the fire stick in the past. Now the box does everything the stick does and I can expand the memory which is a huge plus for me. Also being able to plug directly into a cat5 cable helps with streaming..
1,Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great. Easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. Really great for traveling. Download several books so I have a variety to read from. Long charge life.
1,I was a little hesitant in buying a kindle. I thought it would take away the feeling of reading a hard cover book. I love the kindle. I don't regret buying it. I love that I can store all my books on this device.
1,I purchased a blue and orange one for each of my twin boys. Their bday is on Aug 22. I have not yet gave them the kindle. But I downloading quite a few games before giving it to them. The graphics are amazing. If all goes well i'm thinking about buying the purple one for myself.
1,It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy
1,Great for reading!I only wish it could be larger and more compatible with pdf files
1,"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire"
1,I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
1,"I purchased this for my dad.He is 84 years and enjoys having her play music for him, tell him the weather and even helps control lighting. He loves her jokes and her witty come backs. She is his virtual pet."
1,Easy to use. Lightweight... can easily read in low light / night.
1,"This was sold out on Amazon prior to Christmas, and my spouse really wanted one. This was ordered and delivered sooner than expected, in plenty of time for Christmas. She loves it and uses it several hours each day. Much better vehicle for her use rather than the cell phone. Cruises the web, stays in-touch with family, and dreams! Great service from Best Buy, great product as well."
1,Got it so I can have everything in one device and it does that flawless. It's very fast and responsive and the voice search is really good
1,Bought for Friends Anniversary they love it the first one was damaged no hassle return
1,so far I'm enjoying my wireless headphones and sounds great
0,If you are fan of iOS and iPad then you will not like this product. I prefer to give it to either kids who want to play and watch videos or people who loves to read( only if they Amazon prime account).
1,"I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always bothered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually. But that's a small issue for an otherwise great e-reader."
1,"This is my 2nd Kindle. I love the ability to read anywhere no matter the light, especially at night. I don't disturb anyone with a light if I am having trouble sleeping."
1,"You have to purchase the power outlets, light switches, and other things for Alexa to communicate with. Once you do and setup them up, it works pretty well. You have to be careful if you put it near the TV where they might do a commercial or a story about it on the news, Alexa has pretty good hearing and perks up when she hears her name. Over all, easy to set up with the app and works pretty well. Takes some time getting used to asking Alexa to turn on or off the lights and not just reaching for the light switch."
1,"I didn't like that this model came with a USB cable but not a plug. Other than that, it met my expectations. Synching the new device with my existing Kindle account was easy. And my initial fear that the touchscreen would collect fingerprints and dirt hasn't been a problem so far."
1,Great tablet. Love everything about it. Good selection of apps for free. If you decide to buy apps is also worth it. Cheap prices
1,"I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee."
1,I am enjoying taking the Kindle with me when I am traveling and also just resting in bed before falling asleep.
1,Was able to hook it up in minutes. Emailed Amazon with a question and received an answer back within a day.
0,I got it because a frend that really lime it. I had apple tv and still think is better than this
1,Was looking for something decent and inexpensive for my niece. Got this for Black Friday and so far it's been great. Internal memory doesn't worry me because it will mostly be used for streaming apps like Youtube and Netflix. I wish the UI would be better but overall the tablet is good enough for what i bought it for.
1,I have had my Kindle Paperwhite for over a month now and I absolutely love it. The screen adjustment to match the room lighting is great and it is much faster and responsive than the older Kindle my wife has. It is so lightweight and comfortable to hold. One of the best parts is the battery last for weeks even with heavy use.
1,"This is my third Echo. The secret is the array of microphones. It hears you over music and in your natural speaking voice. Very helpful and a good speaker. Easiest way ever to connect your phone to a Bluetooth speaker. ""Alexa, Bluetooth connect,"" and you are done."
1,Enjoying the kindle fire!!! Great for kids to use!!
1,"Originally figured this would be almost a toy, but as I easily started connecting the Echo to my existing home automation components I realized this would become a key part of my home. Throw in the different connections the Echo can make (with my car, for example) and you now have an essential component to your day...absolutely worth it!"
0,Easy to download apps and nice to watch movies and my daughter loves it
1,It was very easy to use. My grandma was able to figure it out with no problem
1,"For the money, you really can't do much better in the tablet department. Quick, responsive and does everything you want it to do. Highly recommended"
1,This was a great Christmas gift. the price was great and the amazon fire is small enough to bring with to travel .
1,"I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
1,I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
1,Awesome device! Turns your tv into a smart tv. Really no need for cable anymore.
1,"I am definitely happy with my purchase. It's a very good android box, even if most of the content seems to be amazon content with the ability to sideload (install other android apps not from the amazon store) this makes one of the top android boxes. Also the ability to play some games makes it a plus. (just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to 8GB on this box)"
1,Really neat tool. We bought it for a neighbor and he is excited to have it.
1,"I love it! Not only is it good for listening to music, it's great for asking questions too. I love being able to ask how my commute will be!Alexa is always gaining new skills too. Now it works with my home automation system!"
1,"Can do everything the regular kindles can do, but in full color. My Wife loves it and is always reading magazines and watching movies."
1,Great price. Great product. Best product for the money.
1,"There are many apps for the fire box, and there are many uses. The picture is very crisp and set up in a breeze."
1,Bought after seeing my son's echo while on a visit. My wife loved it so bought her one upon our return home.
1,Very easy to set up and the whole family is have alot of fun with this great product!!!
1,"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
1,"A must-have if you have any Kindle or Fire products! This definitely charges things much faster, and is great to have in several locations for convenience, especially if people tend to borrow your chargers."
1,The first thought came into my mind after getting Kindle Paperwhite that why I didn't buy this thing earlier! It is an awesome device. I really didn't think that a digital device can fill up the space of a physical book. Highly recommended.
1,"Good purchase, suits our needs at a reasonable price."
1,This device is fun with all the different apps you can use. Great speaker quality too.
1,"This is so perfect for reading. If you only want it for reading, then I would most definitely get this. I can read for hours on it, in light and in the dark. It's super easy to buy books and download books. Favorite Christmas purchase!"
1,My wife saw the Echo at a friend's house and could not stop talking about it. It's a neat device especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and can link your music files. The kids have fun asking questions or finding out the weather each morning but it's use seems pretty limited to me other than being a fun product.
0,"Works great, but don't like how you have to spell everything out."
1,As a lover of books I love the portability and battery life of this. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
1,I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.
1,bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....
1,"Nothing is ever perfect. I'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which I'm okay with. As long as they don't effect the usage I'm happy. Sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big."
0,"I purchased the Fire tv box and it just stopped working one day. Wont boot, just sits at the logo. I spoke to customer service who could care less. They said the best they could do is sell me another box seeing that my warranty had expired. Its not like I bought this in 2012. Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon. I am on my way to buy an Nvidia Shield TV for my streaming needs. BTW it doesnt have an Amazon app (wink). This is the first box I have ever owned that just stopped working."
1,Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
1,"I want one in every room, this is so handy. I love love love it!!"
1,"I like the tablet. It works really well. I ended up purchasing two, a black one for my wife and I to use and a blue one for our toddler son. So far so good. I did get free virus software with the tablet as part of a black Friday deal but it doesn't seem compatible with the Amazon Fire although it's supposed to be. Thus far that's the only downside."
1,"I use the echo for shopping list, answers to questions, music and much more. I love Alexa and would not trade her for anything!"
1,"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
1,I have no idea why someone would need to pay hundreds for a tablet when they can just get a fire.
1,This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle
1,I bought this to download videos to watch while going on a long road trip. It worked perfect for that.
1,Bought this for my 84 year old mother who is an avid reader. So easy to use! She enjoys the lightweightness of the Kindle paperwhite and the non glare screen. She is able to adjust the font for enjoyable reading sized material and enjoys the LED's for reading at bedtime. Kindle paperwhite is definitely a gift that keeps giving and keeps mom smiling too!
1,I picked this one up to replace an older one that had stopped working. I like the back lite and it's not a bad size.
1,Easy setup and seamless streaming. Would like to see Amazon upgrade this item to 4K.
1,"Easy and convenient for my grandchildren, they really enjoy it"
1,This echo simplifies my daily life activities and is worth every penny.
0,"Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much."
1,Great basic tablet for kids and novices. Worth a try
1,My son loves his Kindle for games and he loves it for reading.
1,This Protective Case was just right for my Kindle.
1,So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
1,Pretty comparable to the other streaming devices I own other than the obvious Amazon geared menu.
0,"the screen is mediocre. the processor is good, very little storage. and you have to deal with ads, every time you turn on the screen. You can pay to have them removed. for that price you can get a better screen, more storage and open ecocistem. that is not tied only to amazon"
1,It's a great working machine fast speed streaming. You are able to install external apps and get a lot of shows all in all I'm very satisfied with this device
1,I bought this in thanksgiving day. It's good for the price !!
1,Love this. Easy to use. Love that you can purchase external memory card for this tablet. I am excited to say I purchased 5 of these for family members and I am happy with the tablet.
1,I really like the kindle. It so much easier to care around to read.
1,I was looking for at replacement tablet and this is exactly what I needed
1,"This is the 6th tablet I have purchased. The Kindle Fire tablets are perfect for just about everyone; from my 2 year old grandson to my mother. I purchased this one for my mother, by the way. For her, I thought she could easily access her email and play mind challenging games. WiFi is need to use this, which is great because there are no monthly charges for using this tablet. Also, it must be set up very securely because no security system is needed."
1,Best Christmas Gift ever to my Mom that doesn't use a computer
1,"Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!"
1,"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store."
1,use it everyday. enjoy reading using the Kindle Fire HD 10.
1,Excellent Product & Highly recommended. Excellent!
1,"Had been looking to replace an RCA tablet from a couple years ago for the kids, one that wouldnt break the bank but still was powerful enough for the games the kids would use it for. Sleek, lightweight, powerful, love that it has 2 cameras."
1,We are enjoying Alexa a lot! she is funny at times
1,The display is not great but can be used as a back up device for rough use
1,I have purchased a few of these items they are perfect for getting rid of tv
0,Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho
1,Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
1,"I Love my new kindle! Is perfect, this model is The best"
1,"I purchased for Christmas gifts, kids are loving so far!"
1,"Bought for my daughter, she loves it, uses it for music mainly."
1,I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
1,"This was purchased to replace the fire stick. If you're debating between the fire stick and the fire TV, get the fire tv box. Waiting for the fire stick to power on and connect to wifi, or trying to type anything with a directional pad wastes too much time!"
1,"Can't beat the price, awesome for kids and doesn't break the bank."
1,This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
1,"Overall it is hard to say this is a good Tablet just looking at it in a vacuum. That being said when you take the price into consideration, it is hard to say it's not a good value. The screen isn't very bright so outdoor use is difficult ( I wanted to use it as a screen for my drone but its not ideal), and it's locked down by the Amazon Echo System. It does work and it doesnt hiccup or struggle too much and again for the value especialyl when I bought it for $33 its hard to argue. It can also be hacked to install the Play Store on it which makes it even more of a value."
1,"Bought on Black Friday, couldn't complain about the price. I bought 3. One for myself, one for my mom and one for my 4yr old step daughter. My mom loves the large font option. I love being able to browse the Web and watch netflix. My little one loves to play games on, thank goodness for the kid option! Don't have to worry about to going to non-kid-friendly apps/websites."
1,The Kindle was purchased for my daughter. She loves it. She plays games on it everyday.
1,I am really impressed with Amazon box. The processor is really fast and responsive. Has one of the better remotes out there.
1,This is great technology. I can even order from it.
1,"Was looking around for a good cheap tablet and this was the best one I could find especially because Best Buy was having a sale so with the Fire, a case, a stylus and a MicroSD card I only spent a little over a $100. I've been using it just about every day since I got it in December and I've not had any problems with it at all"
1,The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.
1,I really love the kindle. Great for the price. And u can add a memory card for more storage.
1,I bought this tablet originally for my kids but I loved it so much I had to purchase one for myself. Love it!!
1,Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal
1,I really love the tablets I brought it for my younger kids
0,This is a good tablet for someone just wanting to surf the internet. Would buy again if was only surfing.
1,"Bought this to replace xfinity cable tv with playstation vue. the quality of the picture is excellent and with all of the others apps, music, and movies from amazon prime you absolutely cannot beat this product. i highly recommend."
1,So far has done essentially thing I have asked of it. It has so many more capabilities so I have just scratched the surface but I very happy. Only rating a 4 because I have not utilized to its full potential. Will be buying three more next month for employees.
1,This is my grandson's 2nd kindle fire! Great product and great price!
1,"I've always used AppleTV but now that I've started using this, I got to it before my Apple TV. More options to choose from. And I can still cast my MacBook to it! (Gotta install an app though) but I like it."
1,This is a great product at a great price! They will make great first time tablets for kids.
1,I tried the Roku but the Fire TV was just more flexible and the menu was easier to navigate.
1,More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
1,It is very easy to use and i love that it syncs with my phone app for holding my reading spot.
0,"Nothing special. It is a pretty good speaker for the money, but it's not that useful for much else. My Apple TV does more for home automation and entertainment."
1,"I would recommend this to anyone. It's an absolutely amazing product. So light, the auto brightness is great and it's convenient to carry around with you."
1,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
1,Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.
1,My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
1,"Easy to setup, battery lasts for as long as needed. You can do all the basics that a higher end tablet does and is reasonably priced.."
1,"We purchased this device when we switched from cable to PlayStation Vue. It works great for that, but we have found we also enjoy watching Amazon movies and listening to Amazon music as well. If you're an Amazon prime member this is a no-brainer. We also enjoy that it is simple for our 9 and 10 year old children to use."
1,I bought this tablet for my son. i really liked the price compared to other brands.
1,"I really like my kindle. It is so gentle on my eyes. I don't have to charge it as often either. Lots of great features, highlighting especially is useful as it saves it to a new ' my clippings' file."
1,The speaker is great and the microphone is good but overall works just as needed.
1,I have a 2014 Kindle HDX and I brought two of these. One for my daughter and one for my husband. I love the new features. I will be buying one for me in the very near future. Great inexpensive price Amazon !!! Thank you for showing that better doesn't have to be extremely pricey. I also love the fact that you added a memory slot. Added 64GB to both. Thank you. Highly recommended!
1,very good product and service will refer a friend.
1,I really enjoy the Echo and the power of Alexa. There are so many different skills that is has something for everyone and while it is used for home automation there are many things you can do with it if you don't have any other connected home devices. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that the speaker quality could be a little better for music. I competes in quality with bluetooth products in the $100-$150 range but systems like the Bose sound link mini are still superior in sound quality.
1,This is an amazing product. Enjoying it very much.
1,"This thing is great she has a response for everything. I love it, music, quotes, jokes, time and weatger, a real one stop shop."
1,this is an excellent product provide a great picture
1,The fire tv has been a great addition to my entertainment system! The customer service was great! My sales associate helped me make a decision by having all the information i needed! This is an example of why i remain a loyal customer.
1,Great for smaller kids who are Too young to play or get a turn to play on Xbox games with 7 siblings
0,.. I bought four of these tablets two of them I need to return because as soon as my nephew's turn them on there were problems with screen being almost completely white and black in the corners you can't see anything I've checked the settings it's not the city it's the tablet SMH I am disappointed
1,Last minute online purchase before taking my daughter on a trip. It was ready for pick up in an hour and kept her entertained the entire ride.
1,"Easy to setup and use for basic everyday use. Haven't gotten into lights and more advanced uses, but all in all very satisfied for the price"
1,"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
1,"Very easy set up. Sound is great, looking foward to use all.its features!"
1,"Bought it on black friday sale. Use it as a ODB reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for $35 there's nothing wrong with it"
1,The Amazon Tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music I like. It has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around. Thumbs up for the Tap!
1,Does everything I thought it would do and then some. Bought one for my daughter and a friend too.
1,These box is amazing!!! A must if you have Amazon Prime.
1,Been in my wish list for long time and purchased this recently. Was worth a purchase
1,"I wanted to upgrade my 3rd gen kindle keyboard to one with a backlight. The paper white is a great device to read on. The backlight and improved screen resolution make a big difference. There's a few software features I'd like Amazon to add but nothing that inhibits me from using the kindle. If you've been thinking of upgrading or jumping into the kindle for the first time, I'd highly recommend the paper white."
1,"My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
1,Left my first reader on the airplane. Rushed right down to replace it. Had a nook before and my wife had a kindle. I finally had to admit she made the better choice.
1,Wi-Fi works great lots of options for viewing and works quick. Small so fits behind TV and does not need to be indirect site for remote
1,"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
1,"This is our second full size Echo and I love it. It is a great device overall, and when combined with other smart home products it really comes to life. I highly recommend one to anyone that is curious about the features or the potential uses in home automation."
0,"I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither Best Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business."
1,The Amazon Fire TV is the way to go! Very easy to set up and use!!! A++
1,"This is my first e-reader. The screen has a nice feel to it. It reads really well. I don't like the fact that Amazon has total control of your purchases. I do not like the Amazon free unlimited book trial. They don't allow access to certain titles. So far I am able to find most of my book selections. I will be creating my own reading lists and want zero input from Amazon. The battery life seams to be awesome. Of course when you shut it off ads pop up. The kindle claims that it doesn't take up battery to display these ads. But they seem to mysteriously change on their own (even when it is turned off) Strange. It is super nice that you can read in the dark with this one. (Kindle Paperwhite) I like the fact it is small enough to carry around in a purse, yet big enough to read...the font is adjustable too, if you need bigger letters."
1,Had a nook before I love my new Kindle . It's so much easier to use
1,"I have purchased numerous kindles and Fire tablets for family and friends. They've all loved them. When they went on sale at Christmas, I decided it was time to get myself one, after, of course, buying three for unsuspecting niece and nephews. I have an older iPad that I love and use but it is limited due to upgraded technology. This Fire tablet is perfect to do all the things I could not do elsewhere. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you owe it to yourself to get one of these things."
1,"Amazing how low cost this tablet is. Good for basic apps and browsing. Has ads on the lock screen unless you pay to get rid of them, but is just the lock screen and does not interfere with any functionality. For cost can't go wrong."
1,This is a great device and my whole family loves it!
1,The set up was quick and simple. The voice commands work well.
1,"Bought this on Deal of the Day which surprised me since it is new to Best Buy. Just push the button and ask ""her"" to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list. Have ""her"" set timers and alarms to wake by. I haven't used half of the features of TAP. The sound is amazingly great for such a small device."
1,"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more"
1,Very pleased with the Kindle Fire. Great price too!
1,I have one of the first kindles and had to use a attached light if I read at night. This paperwhite is perfect for that as well as the perfect size. I absolutely love it!!
1,Easy to set up and use. Love it for streaming you tube and other apps. Voice command is awesome!
1,I got 2 for my kids for Xmas and there working real good they love them and I love the price better then eBay ones that would only work for some time then will stop charging
1,Grandma loves it..plays her games and keeps up with the grandkids.
1,"Love the Amazon Echo, a great addition to the family"
1,What a difference it makes to read from the paperwhite instead of iphone!
1,We love Alexa!! We play music and the quality is outstanding.
1,I enjoy the ease i using the item and the case is perfect
1,Works great once you get the hang of it. Overall happy with it
1,Love it and would probably be just okay using the Fire Stick. Don't need all of the extra storage space and the capability of 4K res (Only beneficial if you have a 4K TV).
1,I have bought a kindle paperwhite as a gift for three people and each has LOVED it. It's a reliable reader with a LONG battery life and a great little traveler. I highly recommend it.
1,"Very easy to set up. Bought it so I could get Directv Now. Wired and wireless connections were used. Now I can watch tv, Netflix, Youtube, all with the same device."
1,Really enjoy my echo. Great sound fun to use and stylist
1,I got this as a gift to my inlaws. This is very handy and easy to use. They love it so much
1,Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.
1,Debated to get Google instead but since we have a Prime subscription it made more sense to go with the Echo. Hope to soon control thermostats and lights.
1,The tablet is great for what is being used for gan
1,My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was
1,"Everyone should own an Amazon Echo. My Echo is like having someone that does exactly what you ask quickly without having to think about it or give you any back talk :). I love my Amazon Echo! This is beyond anything I've used in the past. I find myself relying on it more than I do any other device in my house. The entire family enjoys it. We are planning to purchase a couple more to have on each floor of the house. We love it! If you have been thinking about buying one and haven't, you should pick one up today. You'll be glad you did! A great device/friend the entire family will enjoy! By the way, ordering fast food delivery is one of my family's favorite ask! :)"
1,Excellent product blows away google. It's the way of the future. Try it out
1,"I like the tablet but, I don't like all the ads..."
1,The fire tv has every app that is needed. And it is very easy to install and setup. Probably going to pick up one more!
1,Bought this as a gift so I don't know much about it. Seems nice though
1,"After my grand kids fighting over my wife's Kindle in the car, we decided to get them each one for trips. Good first tablet"
1,My wife loves her Kindke and at this price it was a no brainer. It's fast with a ton of expandable memory storage.
1,Very entertaining and helpful! Kids enjoy it as much as us adults do!
1,amazing device with useful features. Adds/updates amazon cart so fast and even checking out is fairly simple
1,"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same."
1,I very Much enjoy Alexa. A lot of fun. Very helpful. Excellent gift
1,One of the best purchases I've ever made! It's ties into my whole home network and works with all of my phone and other products.
1,Amazon Fire tablet is one of a kind!! Very easy to use and adaptable to fit all needs!
1,"Good tablet for the price. Typically when you pay a small price for a tablet you get a piece of junk, but not this tablet. Its great."
1,great starter tablet for any 2nd grader on up great price
1,Can be educational and lots of fun too. A variety of uses for Alexa.
1,Wanted to replace my fire stick and it was on sale
1,"My first e-reader so I cannot compare it to anything else, but this Kindle Voyage exceeded my expectations. Wonderfully clear screen, lightweight,with excellent controls. I purchased mine during a sale, but it is expensive for an e-reader. Highly recommended."
1,"Like most, I love reading actual books that I can feel in my hand and turn the physical pages of. Due to that thinking, I spent years not really considering a Kindle. All I can say is that I wish I had one years ago!! It's incredibly easy to read on, and so handy to have. I load up tons of books, which take up no space, and am all set. And I love that I can read before bed without having to leave the light on. Having a Kindle has reinvigorated my love of reading, and I'm reading more than I have in the last few years. Cannot recommend this enough."
1,"After dropping by the local store several times and finding they were out of stock, I found one on the shelf!Great product, easy set-up and works great. KODI installed without any issues."
0,"This product is fun, but it does not understand a lot of your questions. It is not a user friend item. So it is limited to very few things it can do. For the money, it needs a lot of work. I was expecting more. But it is a toy to have."
0,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.
1,Exactly what hubby wanted for reading. Likes it better than iPad for reading
1,Great sounding Bluetooth speaker and Alexa is very helpful too.
1,I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it.He reads lots of books and does some web surfing. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,"I was skeptical about buying the Fire at first because I didn't think I'd like it as much as a good old fashioned book, but books are expensive if you read as much and as fast as I do, so I caved and bought it. I am in love! It's super light weight and easy to navigate and I love that it has night settings to protect your eyes from the screen brightness. You also can use all of your social media and other apps on the tablet which is a major plus."
1,This is the best device for watching Netflix content.
1,This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!
1,"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
1,"I am upgrading from a gen. 1. I love that I can add a mini SD for more storage, also a lot easier to navigate. My son now has my old one for reading books."
1,I needed an extra charger for our cabin so that we would not have to pack one back and forth. Arrived just in time and on time that I got it in time for our next trip over. Works like the original.
1,Every day Alexa grows smarter and my music pick just grows with any mood I want to hear . I love that more apps are coming for this product
1,Hands down this is the best ereader that you can buy...
1,I would highly recommend this product for the money
1,This tablet is great for the young kids gift ideas.
1,Love my fire tv so easy to use gives me all my services in one place
1,"The sound quality is amazing. Echo is now part of the family. It's an alarm clock, cooking timer, music player etc."
1,As d scribed
1,"Does everything I need really well. I do both of my email accounts, read all of the news and sports I want, and do light research. It's plenty fast and the screen resolution is just fine. Amazing for the price."
1,Bought for my Grandparents for Christmas and loaded games for them they love it.
1,"Nice 7 "" screen for less than 50.0. Bought 3Gave to relatives . They love them"
1,I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.
1,"This tablet was for my daughters birthday and so far , it's holding up well. She loves it and it does what it was meant ro do. The only drawback is the the screen doesn't get bright like your iphone or Samsung tablets."
1,"My wife had an older Kindle but this one had so many improvements: great paper white reading appearance, longer battery life, and it lights up so she can read in bed."
1,I have the Firestick and wanted something for another TV. Went with the Fire TV. This was worth the extra money. Just works so much better. Faster and less buffering.
1,"This was purchased to replace my 3rd gen Kindle Keyboard. The backlight is a great feature and even though I miss having page turn buttons, it was worth the cost savings to forego them."
1,"Hands down you can't go wrong with this tablet. Especially if its on sale and lower than the normal $50 retail price. Sure some google apps might not be in the market place, but a majority are and if your looking for just another tablet for mobile games or another screen for Netflix or Hulu this tablet would do just fine."
1,A single list is easy. We haven't been able to have multiple lists simultaneously. Simple questions can be answered but more complex ones get rejected or mis-answered. The ability to interpret and hear voices is very good with a long range.
1,The paper white had excellent lighting regardless of the light in the room. Great long battery life as well.
0,It's different than android system's. And to be honest I prefer android.
1,"enjoy this product, very easy to use and update when needed"
1,"Fire , it does the job I wanted it to and that is to entertain my kid and myself. Nothing fancy and it does have it's quirks and bugs. Sometimes can be frustrating on response time with touch screen and loading."
1,"If you are going to be using this allot I recommend the Fire TV over the Stick, it is much more responsive. The fire stick tends to be a bit laggy when navigating and launching apps."
1,Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.
1,Excellent quality and super easy to use. I love that you can expand the memory. Can't beat it for the price!!
1,I LOVE THIS THING. HOW DID WE LIVE WITH OUT IT BEFORE HAND! Such and amazing product
1,Been a Kindle fan since 1.0. Keeps getting better. I thought the original Paperwhite was perfect however the extra storage and speed are needed and a welcome addition.
1,Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.
1,The perfect reader you need if you choose to read everywhere
1,"Wanted to buy a reliable and cost effective tablet. Was afraid the screen might be too small. Dad loved it. He is 70 and not too tech savvy but is able to browse the Internet, use Skype and listen to music. He is afraid he will purchase something by mistake and get a charge on his credit card. :)"
1,"The words on the screen are very clear. If a hardcopy book's type is too small I can read it on kindle because I can make the size bigger. Read many positive reviews of the ease of use, page turner, special functions and clear display that I was convinced to buy the kindle voyage"
1,"If you stream everyday, it is worth the investment for the 4k box vs the fire stick. More powerful, more storage, more time to watch with less loading times."
1,I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
0,This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
1,This is a great tablet! It has lots of features. The cost is really low for such a great tablet.
1,Great box and fast for steaming and videos good for sports
1,Amazing! Cheap! Easy! Fast! The best all in one media device ever created!
1,"The tablet doesn't have the best specs, but it was cheap and for my 3 year old. Great product so far!"
1,I bought for my grand child. She loves it uses it a lot
1,The new Kindle Fire's price point is amazing. At $50 this tablet is a full-featured device that is practically disposable.
1,"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
1,Great for road trips and bright enough to read with by the pool.
1,"I used to have a old version of kindle, and this one is a great improvement, the resolution is great and the backlight is especially convenient"
1,So far no problems except no kid friendly case for tablet.
1,Does the job. Not often needed as the charge on the kindle lasts so long..
1,good item
1,"Great Device! Quick, easy to use and a great value!"
1,"you can read in any light. nice, especially at night when you don't want to disturb anyone. even outside in the daylight"
1,"I've had the Apple TV, Cromecast, and Amazon Fire and Amazon has the most options that fit what I watch and use not to mention it has the best HD quality I highly recommend it"
1,Responsive to voice. Has good quality sound. Wish it was wireless!
1,"The Good:Great for music playing, and lighting control if you've bought Hue lights, or smart switches. I have the WeMo switches and they work pretty wellGreat for some control of Amazon's Fire stick TV.OK at answering general questions, but not amazing. Alexa is often stumped...Still... its's pretty cool to speak, and have your house react around you..."
1,I needed to replace my old Kindle reader. This gave me an inexpensive reader and a tablet. Screen quality is not as sharp as HD and contrast is not as good as I'd like. BUT it is a great deal and meets the need.
1,"I can't say enough about the Amazon Tap. I enjoy playing music from it and that it's portable. I can play music from my Amazon prime account, Pandora or from my phone. It is fun to ask Alexa questions. Yes, Alexa cannot answer all my questions or find everything I ask for, but it is still amazing."
1,"I bought this reader for a trip I was planning. I must say, it is awesome! The size is just perfect to throw in a backpack and the resolution is very good for this pricepoint. You can't go wrong purchasing this!"
0,Alexa is great and performs well. Biggest issues are Bing is a horrible search engine and is inevitably wrong vs Google. Many times it doesn't understand the question or gives wrong answers while OK google gives much better repossess. Also Amazon music is somewhat limited. Should allow ability to play Sonos or iTunes libraries.
1,"Great but needs more work to be worth the money. Very limited in what can be asked in a form of questions. You have to continually down load skills in order to ask questions related to topics this is very taxing and spending time doing it makes you just say, ""forget it"". Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Really should have purchased the Google one but oh well....."
1,Great for games and information on daily events and weather
1,"Best Reader ever. I've had a lot of Readers like Paper white 2013, Kindle DX, B&N nook and Kobo Aura HD before I get Kindle Voyage. But this one is really different.The only feature that I wish it'd support is memory slot! I guess Amazon will add it to the next generation of Kindles as well as Kindle Fires..."
1,"For the money it can do a lot, only downside is for the price to be so cheap it is pre-loaded with a LOT of stuff you don't want."
1,"I bought three for my each of my grandchildren. They are 2,5,and 7. The 2 year old loves watching Elmo on the tablet and it's not too loud and the picture is very clear and colorful and she knows how to push the icons on the screen herself, the 5 and 7 year old plays car racing games as well as reading and math games. It has parental settings on the tablet so that I can assure that's it content is kid friendly. They love it."
1,"I love my echo, it doe everything they say it does. I love listening to my music on my echo the speakers are really good."
1,Purchased this tablet for my grandson who is two years old. He loved it!. But the power cord and the tablet hook up didn't work very long. I will be taking it back for a replacement. As long as the connection stays snug it's a great tablet.
1,Great addition to our home entertainment setup. Connected up with HDMI and was working within minutes.
1,"I bought this for my four year old. I haven't given it to him yet, but I'm impressed how easy it is to use and how many apps are available for his age!"
1,The Kindle Fire is FABULOUS! I have kids ages 4 to 16 that utilize these devices every day so they get lots of use and wear and tear. We haven't had any problems and Amazon customer service is top notch.
1,This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
1,Purchased this tablet for my nephew and it's amazing.
1,"Amazon Echo is a smart home device, but it's not quite as smart as Google Home. It also doesn't integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker. I don't care about ordering products from Amazon using my voice, and I wish Alexa would answer my more obscure questions like Google does.Where the Echo shines right now though is with smart home integration. I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice)."
1,Love the Kindle. Easy to travel with and can be used as a tablet or reader.
1,this is such a nice tech thing even the kids can operate and nice for the Google challenge
1,"This Amazon Echo might be similar to that of Siri and Google, however, it makes it fun to be able to ask it questions no matter where you are at in the room. It gives precise weather updates, interesting traffic details, and even knowledgeable history lessons each morning. With endless possibilities, this Amazon Echo is a step towards more interesting things to come."
1,Easy to install. Super easy for everyone to use. Can't imagine tv without it!
1,The fire does a ton and costs very little. I really like it
1,My Fire TV has it so much easier moving away from cable.
0,"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!"
1,After two broken iPad screens we switched to this fire tablet for our daughter. It's been amazing. So much more durable and amazon games have actually free where it includes in app purchases.
1,This is an amazing product. Got it for my dorm and I love it.
1,"I only wish I knew how to use it to its potential, it is capable of so much more."
1,Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
1,Bought this to use Play Station Vue to replace Comcast cable. Cheaper and provides all the cable channels we usually watch. Seems to work great - glad I did it!
1,Echo has a great speaker for sound and easy to program for music and radio stations Great product easy to use. Get daily news weather set alarm clock etc.
1,"I bought this on Black Friday because of the $35 price. I wanted one since I enjoyed using my wife's. This one is a little smaller than hers, but it works wonderful. I have a lot of books downloaded & about 5 games. It has 8gb of memory so it can't handle a ton of games. It can handle those no problem. I really enjoy reading on this before bed and when I need to pass time."
1,"Much lighter than my last Kindle, I love it. Great value for the price."
1,Alexa isn't as smart as I thought she would be but is pretty good.
1,"All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better."
1,"Turned older TV into a smart TV. I wish a hdmi cable would of came with fire stick, as it does the cheaper fire stick."
1,"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
1,"An easy way to read your favorite books!Whether you're in the sun or in the dark, this is the best Kindle ever.The only thing I don't like is the 'flash' when you turn the page."
1,"The paperwhite model has a very clear screen and backlight so I can be used in most lighting conditions. The manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of. My only complaint is that it includes a USB cable but does not include a charger in the box. Luckily I had a number of appropriate chargers that work well with the reader. Compared to the more expensive models, the Paperwhite had the functionality that I was looking for at a reasonable price."
1,"Great tablet for kids. Also great for travel as you can expand the memory allowing you to store music, games, movies, etc. battery life is decent but doesn't charge back up very fast so that is one downside."
1,"I have the fire stick and the fire tv box, I got the box because it allows you to pair a Bluetooth headset so you can listen to your shows at night without waking anyone up, problem is there is interference between wifi and Bluetooth and so listening with headphones gets very choppy, have to connect box thru Ethernet to fix problem."
1,Excellent tablet both for reading books and for going to the web
1,"I really liked it, even though I purchased for my grand daughters. I have a 6 HD Fire, but I liked this one better. With the expansion slot for space"
1,However it seems their life is about 3 years. Wish it was longer
1,"I ended up getting this Fire for $35 on Black Friday for my youngest son. Great price and great product, easy to use and set up."
0,"This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far."
1,"I Love Love my Fire, you get way more than you expect from this Fire Tablet, Plug into speakers GREAT Sound, Reading screens are wonderful with the ability to use Night time light, Takes amazing photo's and videos, with good quality sound, SMS access is so easy and you can even receive calls, All search engines are accessble. I am getting My little grandkids each one of these with the great tablet protecter. This tablet is Kid friendly and as a parent you can control EVERYTHING they see. Price is amazing and you get way more than you would expect from a tablet that is so affordable."
1,"I always liked reading books in physical form, but it just got to hard to carry around. Plus, my bookshelf was too full. This solves both problems!"
1,bought this tablet for a great price and would recomend it
1,"Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies."
1,"I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value."
1,Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature
1,I mainly use my Kindle strictly for book reading. It's the second one I've owned. The first one I had for several years but quit taking a charge. The device is easy to use and has good battery life.
1,Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money.
1,muy bueno
1,"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
1,I brought this tablet for my son for Christmas and he loves it. I would definitely recommend this tablet as a starter tablet for younger kids.
1,"Paperwhite feature is perfect for intended uses. Outside, on the beach, at night."
1,love the fire tv.. super fast uploads. Small and compact
1,I love that this tablet has a variety of apps that can be easily be taken to places
1,"I read all reviews about the tap so I decided to try it, I love it. The tap keeps me up to date with weather, news etc. I use it every day."
1,A Must Have!! Super helpful and convenient. Big time saver and all around fun!!
1,This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
1,"I Love my echo. I use my echo for just about everything. I've set up my lights, my tv, I also ask it several questions almost every day. My wife uses it to get cooking measurements. I play music and games as well."
1,This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.
1,Alexa is always there to answer questions aboutjust about anything and seems to keep learning.will get fire tv soon as a roku died on me and alexacan work it for me
1,Great device. This could seriously make me ditch any cable service.
1,My father was visiting and broke his tablet and I able able to pick this up in the store the same day.
1,It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs.
1,It is a great investment. Can read at night without disturbing partner. Only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. This could be user problem.
1,good for the 7 year old grandson to use easy parental controls
1,My wife generally does not like technology gifts. We now have several items in our house connected to our Echo including light bulbs (sold separately).Overall - lots of functionality with the echo. This includes trivia games or hot potato that you can play with the kids.Enjoy this very much and would recommend this to anyone looking for a device like this in their home.
1,I bought this for a gift. They seem to like it fine. I have a Dot and a Tap and use them a lot.
1,We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
1,"The Echo has the best integration in to Amazon for shopping purposes. It also some excellent integration with other smart devices such has Logitech Harmony and Smart Things. However, it is not quite as intuitive as the Google Home device or able to answer as many questions. So, overall, good for home automation. Not so much for asking general questions."
1,Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it
1,We bought this tablet for my four year old nephew and it works great! We love how it can be set up for different users!
1,I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
0,The echo is so much fun to play with and works great with Amazon and hue products. It's very hard to get it to work with our iPhone and iTunes. I can't figure out how to get my iTunes playlist to work or sync it to my calander from phone. I'm sure it's possible because my tech skills are mediocre at best. Had I known what a pain this would be I would have looked into the google product more closely. The echo itself is a great product but I would not buy it again unless they open it up to other providers services.
1,Make sure that you get it soon. They sell out fast!
1,I replaced an older Kindle with a new paper white version. What a super improvement.
1,The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
1,Works awesome. Was hesitant at first not sure how it works but after playing around with it for a while you figure out all the cool things it can do.
1,"I love my Kindle!! I have gotten so spoiled that if I can't get a book on my Kindle, I don't read it."
0,"Not enough free programs. Even with a subscription to Netflix, etc. you still have to pay for most movies, shows."
1,I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers
1,This tablet is worth the money you spend. If you looking for your first tablet go ahead and buy it.. You will not regret
1,works well with no problems and I am happy with my purchase
1,Got this as a gift for my girlfriend who has Amazon Prime and loves binge watching Netflix. It's an affordable and decent quality Netflix machine.
1,"I really like the Amazon Fire Tablet because it is easy to navigate, the size of the screen is good, and the weight of the product is not too heavy. I purchased the first one for my husband a couple of years ago, but he broke it and I decided that it would be a great Christmas gift for him since he really enjoyed the first one. Because I really like the product, I have recommended it to several people who have purchased one."
1,It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it.
1,Bought this as a Xmas gift for my daughter to replace her older version kindle. She loves it.
1,I bought this for my mom who is a first time tablet user. It is easy to use and I love that fact that I did not spend a fortune to get her started!
1,Kindle has nailed it when it comes to tablets. They are affordable and efficicient for the money.
1,This stick is 100 times better than my Chromecast. Dont know how I had not discovered Fire Sticks versatile functionality before.
1,I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
1,A great buy for the money. Very easy to set up and use. I recommend to anyone looking for a small tablet.
1,Very good for kids. Good quality. We couldn't see any problem.
1,Best purchase ever! Love our Echo. Highly recommend the Amazon Echo to anyone
1,"I like the echo, however, it needs more instructions as to how to install various music, games, etc."
1,This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
1,I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it and the games
1,I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.
1,I bought this as an upgrade to the kindle fire that I bought my wife 3 years ago. She says that it is easier to read and loves the smaller size.
1,What I expected
1,"At first, I was kind of worried that I would not be able to operate it. But it is so easy to use! I also like the parental controls, so I can control what my children watch. The best part of all though is that I don't have to see any infomercials! My family and myself have definitely enjoyed having this product in our home. We have yet to run out of programs and movies to watch!"
1,I don't really see a difference between the box and the stick. They both buffer. I do like that I expand the memory on the box.
1,My kids love it . I love the size and weight . It not easy to broke or crack
1,This unit has a speaker built-in. The bullet has to be connected to an external source in order for it to obey the commands. Great purchase
1,Amazon makes great tablets and this is at a great price
1,It never ceases to amaze me. If she could cook I'd marry her.
1,I bought this to work with my alarm system and works great.
1,"Cheap tablet, bought as a secret santa gift exchange item. My cousin opened it on Christmas and absoluitely loved it. Simple and easy to use, not as fast as an Ipad, but still serves in purpose for simple web browsing."
1,"like the fact that this is backlit, but has more of the contrast like in the early versions of the kindle that were not backlit"
1,I have used tablets before that cost a lot more money. For the price this tablet is a bargain.
1,we got this for my dads girlfriend this year for christmas and she was able to just start using it right away. it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but its not too bad. compared to my tab s2 it is pretty close when it comes to responsiveness. if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace constantly trying to insert ads and sell you things this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it.
1,"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!"
1,"Of the three streaming boxes i have owned this one is hands down the best. I added Playstation Vue app and now i get 59 cable channels. Prime movies, music, and TV is awesome."
1,"Let's be perfectly clear, this is not an IPAD. But for $50.00 this 7"" Fire is a steal. I'm very happy with this purchase."
0,"Since I am more of an Apple Buckie, I wish this had more integration to my iTunes Library. I use it with my LifeX lights, get the news and weather. Not sure I would buy it again, but if you are a Google Buckie then it would be a great toy"
1,I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.
1,"I picked this Kindle because I wanted the option to do other things on it besides just read. It's great if you're looking for a Kindle you have the option to do a few extra things on -- surf the web, check Facebook, check your email, etc. For the price, I think it's a good value."
1,"This product is good but only missing is there are not much devices are coming with Echo, hope in future will see more. Other than this my son enjoying this cool gadget to check weather, alarm etc.."
1,Excellant starter tablet . I love that it is preset with children in mind
1,Have enjoyed it since we set it up the first night. Kids love to ask random questions every morning and the jokes are actually funny.
1,This product is very cheap compared to a iPad & works as good!
1,my wife bought this for herself and loves it. has had it for two months
1,Is part of my family!!!We love my new Amazon echo. :)
1,Great products from amazon Fire tv 1080p quality
1,Enjoying this product and anxious to learn more about it.
1,"Own a few dots, needed this for office area. The speaker is amazing and you can feel the quality. Alexa is here to stay."
1,Love love it. the best gift for christmas I was given
1,Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum
1,"had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good!"
1,Works well with Alexa controlled switches and external systems. Needs work on answering arbitrary questions that need to be looked up online. but over all worth the price of admission.
1,"Great product for the, you can't go wrong with purchase."
1,This equipment is an joy to have.i would recommend product to friends.
1,"I love this tablet more than my Ipad! I bought this item for both my son's, ages 7 &8, they love them! They are inexpensive and very easy to use also easy to set parental controls. They play all thier favorite apps and games watch movies... for free. I wish there were more options or variety on protective cases. Otherwise, it's an awesome product for any age!"
1,My wife is enjoying her new tablet because she is able to receive free books through her Kindle account!
1,The parental controls are amazing! Super easy for my daughter to operate
1,Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
1,I love the paper while kindle. I can read at night without a table light on.
1,"The Amazon Kindle is a great device for any reader. It is simple to use and fits the purpose. Operating system is a little slow comparing to other devices, but gets the job done."
1,Great product for a reasonable price. A lot of fun!
1,"This is one of the coolest and neatest tech toys out there. It has a reasonable price and offers many many options in terms of use. It can pair with your lights and many other tech toys to be all verbally controlled. It is a great source for simple things even such as weather and news. Have an amazon Prime account and feel free to unleash the music as the speaker in Alexa is pretty beast and can handle some serious tunes. Worth the money if you like tech, both small and big."
1,This tablet has been a great learning tool for my child.
1,I gave this as a gift. The person that received it hasn't said anything about being unhappy with it.
1,My kids have two kindle fires already and decided to add a third for the youngest. You can't beat the price of the tablet and with parental locks I am able to decide what they can access and what to block.
1,"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
1,"Love the size, and sharp clear pictures and sounds"
1,My daughter loves it keeps the kids occupied. I would recommend to anyone with kids
1,I have had some issues with this but not having a very helpful team to resolve issues.... I work and go to school I don't have time after time to beg and plead to get fixed...
1,The Amazon fire TV has been a nice addition at home. Has everything you need on one device and more. Highly recommend to anyone who streams videos.
1,Paperwhite kindle is great...especially when reading outside in bright light (like at the beach or in the backyard patio)! This is the main reason for getting it. No glare!
1,Excellent overall quality fast easy to setup no hassel. Great amazon selection not to many updates good content. no lag amazing picture quality.
1,We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
1,Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.
1,"Very satisfied with this product. For months, I have been using both my phone and laptop for reading books, not too bad, but the battery consumption is a deal-breaker (on phone and laptop).With this reader, you get weeks of battery life, and the display... It looks just like a page from a book. Very easy on the eyes! I have about 300 pdf books on my Paperwhite. Also, pick up the paperwhite case, very nice to keep your device protected."
1,"very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
0,Not impressed but don't regret it. I like the parent controls a lot though - main reason I got it.
1,I have wanted Echo ever since it came out. I ordered it off of amazon and they kept saying it was on the wait list. Walked into Best Buy and it was on the shelve in the store. Grabbed one and it was worth the wait. When I got home called Amazon and cancelled my order.
1,"If you love to read or want your kids to read, get this device, that's it."
1,"We purchased the Echo originally when it was first available for prime members only. At the time it felt like a novelty toy and didn't do much. Since that time, it has had major advancements in it's capabilities. We now use it to control our lights, music as well as a personal digital assistant. I recently purchase one for my parents for Christmas, and they're loving it too."
1,"great product to use , easy to setup and use.. with all amazon options"
1,This is great to turn an ordinary tv that has an HDMI port into somewhat of a smart tv.
1,Great for streaming...only complaint is the remote is clicky when pushing the buttons. Not good when trying to watch tv while others are sleeping.
1,"Alexa is always there when I need her. Plays music, tells jokes, knows how to multiply, add, subtract, keeps a shopping list and a myriad of other things. Really fun!"
1,Purchased this for my mother for mother's day. she is retired and loves to play cards on her laptop and read. She doesn't shop a lot and doesn't have internet access at her home. We bought this and my daughter uses our MiFi to download numerous books periodically for her. She has also downloaded numerous games for her to play. She loves having something smaller and so handy at her fingertips when she sits down to take a break during the day.
1,"It's not really an Android device as everything is Amazon centric. Not a massive problem unless you want to integrate with Google products such as ChromeCast. You also can't switch off tracking features and use add blockers, the lock screen even has an advert! However if you can put up with that then it is a great little tablet with excellent performance."
1,"For $35, its worth. The user interface is bit difficult to use and touch screen response is not as expected."
1,"I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my ""library"" that's not taking up space on my phone."
0,"If you enjoy music do not buy, you cannot send a Bluetooth signal out to an external speaker. She is not as smart as Siri and answers basic basic questions. I deal with it because I bought the WeMo fixtures for lights and switches and she works fine with those. I would recommend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud"
1,I have found my echo to be fun and useful! It understands what i say most of the time.
1,"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
1,"I feel that it is a good product for reading a book, especially since you can carry many books with you instead of ""carrying"" the actual books. I thought it would be a brighter screen than others but am a little disappointed in that regard."
1,I bought this so i can save all of my books. It was a bit small at first but you get used to it. Overall i am very satistfy
1,We bought these for our 6 and 7 yr old kids for Christmas. They use iPads at school and are used to working on a tablet. The fire has been an excellent choice for them. It is easy to navigate and user friendly.
0,I felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader
1,It's a great tablet for kids and great videos look great and colorful
1,This is a simple tablet and easy to use. I would buy it again.
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire tablet for $33.00 during black Friday and it has exceeded my expectations. Once I cleared all the clutter of useless apps, I was able to set it up just right for my 13 yr old son. Would definitely purchases again."
1,One of the best tablets other than android out there
1,"Wife loves it, it is neat how it works and the info is endless, music options are whatever you can think of !"
1,"Have Amazon echo, dot and now the tap. All work very well, and.the tap sounds great."
1,"Easy to set up, excellent sound quality. So much fun to use"
1,I purchased the Amazon Fire Tablet because I have had one for about 5 or 6 years. I wanted a tablet that was sturdy and would last because I purchased it for 2 of my grandchildren
1,We love playing music and radio with it. Or kids ask questions and it is quite entertaining
1,Best speaker/personal assistant out there. Don't buy anything else.
1,Super Fast and good storage. Cool I was able to iunstall Kodi and easy access.
1,I have the have the Echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home. Especially if I'm working in the garage and want to listen to music
1,"Excellent product, it was very easy to install. Compatible to all of our electronic equipment. Very user-friendly – love that it it has the voice feature on the remote."
1,This is very functional and user friendly! Great for kids too!
1,Was bought for my 8 yr old who loves it to pieces!
1,Git this for my son who had already broke his 1st tablet. I got this for about half the price of his first one and it is much better quality than the 1st one. Thinking about getting another one for his brother.
1,"It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating."
1,I bought this for a friends daughter and she loves it she is 10.
1,"I really like how it light up from behind, which allows me to read it in the bright light and in the dark."
1,Purchased as a reward for perfect attendance for middle school students. This was just what we (and they) wanted.
1,"Must have!!! Movies, sports, and much more at the click of a button (you must have wifi to use)"
1,I was worried with the smaller screen but it really is great. I have had no issues.
1,I love it. It is just as they said. Kindle fire hd.
1,Tablets are best used for personal reading. Clear and it like a book. you dont have to sahre
1,"I have loved using Amazon Fire to watch movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime. The user interface is easy to operate, and is even better than Apple TV."
1,"Great product. An excellent alternative to the much more expensive Apple Tv. Gives you the option to display 4k context (Netflix) wich current version of Apple Tv does not allows you to do. I bought so that I can have the SlingBox app wich you can not get with Apple Tv, Sony Android TV, LG OS, or Sony Playstation 4.Great product. Highly Recommended."
1,Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.
1,"I had resisted a kindle for years and finally gave in for travel. Yes, I am one of ""those"" who love books! Surprisingly, I really like the paper white kindle. It is easy to read & works well in most lighting situations. There are two things that keep me from loving it. 1) I really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud. 2) I thought it would be a lot cheaper to get books for the kindle. It may be a little cheaper but not a lot. You would think that without the cost of paper, etc, that savings would be passed on to the customer. Since they don't, I tuck it away until I travel."
1,Love the size and quality. Good price and convinient size.
1,My first Kindle and I love it. No backlight and perfect view in the sun are awesome.
1,This is the coolest technology I purchased since putting Windows 10 on my new laptop. I love being able to use the microphone to ask questions and request music. Combined with my sound bar they blow everyone away that comes to visit me.
1,Grandkids love it! It's very easy for them to use. They enjoy reading and playing games!!!
1,"Good for playing music, asking weather, details about famous people."
1,"Really like the Kindle. The screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my Ipad!."
1,gave it to my wife who never used a computer or anything hi techshe loves it and had no problem learning to use it...
1,This is a great product for kids. User friendly lots of capabilities.
1,I was happy with the product. I couldn't pass up on the price and also it runs very nicely.
1,Very simple to set up and works great right out of the box. Automatically creates to do lists and shopping lists which you can access through the app. This has become my favorite feature and I didn't even know about it when I bought the unit!
0,So I got this for my nephew mostly for books for school and games but he tends to get anoid with it cause the internet connection that it picks up doesn't stay but other than that great
1,I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for my niece and she loves it
1,i bought an amazon fire 7 tablet for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it. it is easy to operate and charge.
1,The best tablet . Better the Samsung . I have had 3 samsungs tablets and they all sucked and broke fast
1,"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase."
1,"While it is mostly a way to sell you more stuff, it is very useful and you can manage the temptation with discipline."
1,Great in sunlight. Long battery life. Very happy with purchase.
1,Perfect to watch anything I need small and to the point
1,My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.
1,"Clear screen, buttons act up a little. After numerous days of review I feel that this was the best option."
1,I love the size and the well-lit screen. The words appear very crisp and easy to read!!!
0,"So I've seen this at the mall and the TV ads and thought hmmm that sounds good. Note mine does not sound as good as the units I've heard play music at the stores. I don't know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that. All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick. So if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it. She can turn on the Amazon Fire Stick but she can't put your TV back to what you were watching before.The Echo device will often tell you to go to the Alexa App. So I'm really not sure what the Echo Device does. Everything is run through the Alexa App so just get your table out and use Alexa that way?I'm just not very happy with this purchase. I went to the Mall and the person said ""Bring in your Tablet and I can see what is going on"". So see it's driven by that tablet and the app right?"
1,I bought two of these tablets for my nephews! They are extremely versatile with games and other resources for a great price! I considered getting them Nintendo DS systems but realized that they would be able to do so much more with tablets for half the price.
1,The Amazon Fire TV Fred me from high monthly bills and provide a huge variety of older programming.
1,"I wanted an inexpensive tablet for muy son, but still wanted good quality.....it doesn't exist....it does exist this 50 dollar tablet is perfect for him to surf the Web and play his game, my son has it since a year ago go and no problems, so I got one for my nephew."
1,Next release includes Alexa the famous personal assistant - so add to all the features and great value on this generation and another price drop as well!!!!
1,Bought these as gifts so I cannot review the quality but the size is palm perfect and the price is just right.
1,Love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms. Has a decent amount of Bass for the size.
1,"Originally purchased for visually impaired elderly person. I would have liked the screen to be at least 2"" larger."
1,"Terrific product. I was pleasantly surprised. The fire exceeded my expectations. The cost was literally a fraction of an ipad, yet it has the same functionality. I liked it so much that I returned the next day and got another for my wife."
1,I have been very pleased with the Whitepaper e-reader so far. Good battery life and easy to use.
1,It cool speak what you want and with amazon prime can just place order by talking
1,I bought this tablet for my senior citizen mother and it is easy for her to use.
1,"Tablet works just like any other tablet. Very easy to use, does not freeze up, and battery lasts long"
1,best on the market you can watch movies from amazon live tv
1,It's has the perfect settings for my kids usage. Keeps her away from all the inappropriate stuff n she has easy access to any downloads that interest her. Only downside is she can't access YouTube kids.
1,"Bought 2 of these for Christmas for my sons. One of them seems to be a bit better than the other. One works as I would hope it would, the other acts a little hard if hearing (I'm speaking about the Echo, not my sons)! Alexa doesn't always recognize her name and obey commands."
1,This tablet is a great tablet for a great price. It meets your needs of a tablet -from Internet surfing to reading your favorite books.
1,This is a great device for entertaining at home or just lounging on your own.
1,"This was purchased because every time I would try to stream something from my tv, it would be laggy. This solved my problem. Easy set-up and user friendly."
1,The device is fun to use and is nice for the family. I wish this model had the connection to other systems like the smaller version. Music is really nice and easy to play through the device.
1,"Smart. Rapid response, indispensable in any house in the future"
1,Bought it for my daughter 5 years old. Works great for her. She can do some reading and common core problems.
1,"Alexa is pretty good. Makes listening to music more fun. A lot of capabilities apart from just music.....news, games etc. We like it!"
1,Sleak littoe device for the price for normal everyday use.
1,I purchased two of these during Black Friday for $39. My kids love using these!!!
0,There was a lot of proprietary stuff that takes away from the actual usage of the device.
1,THIS TABLE WAS PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEED IT FOR. IT HAS GREAT SPEED AND WHOLE ALL MY DOWNLOADS.
0,I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
1,Great tablet works very good and the price is cheap.
1,Mostly use the Fire on the bus ride to/from work for You-tube/g-mail and Face-booking and it functions very well for thise uses and constanrly keeps up with the wi-fi when i switch buses Sometimes I have to reconnnet but mostly not ! I have to charge mine about once a week and usually give it a top-off of juice over the weekend. Battery life might be an issue if I ran mine more intensly but works for me. Does alot of stuff I've really only scratched the surface of what it can do.
1,"I am not highly technical and this was easy to learn how to use. It is small enough to be easy to carry. I have been able to download the few games that I play. So far, I can't find a single thing to be unhappy about!"
1,"This device is easy to use, and with internet and selected video apps, there's no reason to leave the house!"
1,"I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access."
1,Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
1,"I really enjoy the basic amazon kindle and best buy had a great deal on it when I purchased it. It's very easy on the eyes and there is no glare when reading outside even on a sunny day just as advertised. It has the look of book in that sense. I was able to order this online and ""pick up in store"" and it was very convenient because I was low on time. I highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an eReader. A few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go."
1,"Bought this for my mother. She thought it would be good for calendar and reminders. After setting up and installing a few extra apps, she seems to enjoy it, but mostly using it for music, weather, etc."
1,Love my new Alexa. Sooo easy to use and so many apps to program for her. The best purchase I've made in a very long time!
1,This tab is great for kids and parents alike. I recommend this product to others.
1,This is my 3rd amazon fire tv box. I have no problems with the amazon fire tv. Great Product.
1,The Amazon Echo does everything for us from setting our thermostats to turning lights and tvs on and off. We recommend it to anyone looking for something that will help make your smart home products even smarter.
1,"Bought for granddaughter, age 11. She had no trouble setting everything up, even though she'd only been familiar with Apple's phone, ipod and ipad. Her only regret was no ""Facetime"", so Skype will suffice. Video quality is great, can't beat the price!"
1,I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy
1,"It's fast, n I love the expandable memory slot, I love how my tv remote can control it also deff worth buying"
1,Easy to use. Good value. Buying experience was typical for Best Buy - helpful and knowledgable staff made buying experience easy and was able to purchase with confidence for application intended.
1,"Alexa, write the review please. Well, not quite that good yet, but it is a lot of fun and makes life more hands free which also means it is easier to multitask."
1,I purchased a fire stick months ago. I like the product but wanted something more. The Fire TV is the way to go. The extra money for the fire tv is well worth it.
1,"I really like this product. It is my first e-reader. My family has had them but now that I have my own I love it. It really looks like you are reading a real page in a book and the backlight is what really makes the difference for me. It allows me to read anywhere even in the dark without worry about fumbling with a reading light. Although I love the feel of a real book and watching the bookmark go further through the pages I am starting to get over that. The connivence of holding this instead of a book and also being able to have multiple books going at once without carrying a bunch of books with you is great. I can fit this in my coat pocket on the train while I commute. It is pretty small and now that I figured out how to borrow kindle books from my library via overdrive I save a ton of money by borrowing instead of paying for all my kindle books. I definitely recommend this Kindle Paperwhite product, the 300 ppi screen is really nice and the price is very reasonable. I couldn't find any reason to buy the more expensive version called the Voyage so my opinion is get this one."
1,I bought this for my mom so she could play her games and do Facebook...she was having a hard time seeing them on her phone. She absolutely loves her tablet. She carries it everywhere. A great purchase. I would buy it again and again for her joy. Well worth the money. A big hooray to Amazon and Best Buy!
1,I'd recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use.
1,"I am enjoying the Echo. I get news, weather and other information that I like each day. It is nice that I can also play the music I have with Amazon.I add new tasks all the time and I am still learning what I can do with it."
1,Sound quality is way better! I would recommend this product to someone that is going to use it to listen to music. I also have echo dot and those work nice too but Alexa seems more reliable.
1,"The price is right for a kid's tablet. If they break it, I won't be very mad. It's easy to set parental controls too."
1,I bought this as a gift for my sister. Alexa works great! The speaker? Even better! Excellent quality...sounds better than many wireless speakers in the market.
1,Tablet helps get children use to having a tablet.also good for alduts
1,Really fast small and easy to store away and I always use it at work.
1,"He loves it, I love it. It was the perfect birthday gift for him. He has lots of games to play,and its perfect for my reading."
1,"Got this for my son, great inexpensive tablet for a beginner."
1,Gift suitable for an older person to spend time playing games. Visual size is reasonable.
1,We've purchased quite a few of these for our children and nephews and nieces. Works well has reading and games
1,"Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire."
1,Wish it had its own onternet connection but other than that great purchase
1,This is a much better alternative to apple tv.you can do so much more with this powerful machine
1,"The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe."
1,Purchased this so I can use Bluetooth headphones with it. Works perfectly! I use it everyday!!! Awesome buy!!!
1,Good tablet for traveling and reading on the road.
1,"First time with anything like Alexa and still trying to figure out all her features. Kids love to ask her questions but she doesn't connect to as many apps as I would like and doesn't connect with my Apple products (calendar, music playlists, etc). Wish I'd realized that sooner but still enjoy listening to podcasts & Audible books. She has great sound quality for music as well."
1,Love this product! Great for entertaining purposes.
1,"Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email."
1,"What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time."
0,"Ouch. I bought this Fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. A couple of hours later, I picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.I twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.I'm sure I had a defective/damaged tablet, but I was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if Amazon brought back the higher quality HDX tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets."
1,This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all.
1,"Amazon Echo is my new favorite , I love Alexia, sound is great. I use timer in kitchen, making list, checking weather where my loved one's live, and stock market."
1,This a cool little product. Alexa is easy to use and responsive. Would buy again.
1,"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
1,Always great amazon product. Wish I could download to hard drive.
1,I liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kids proof
1,This was a purchase made for a cruise. I could not see my fire in the sun.
1,I returned as I want to see the new one with screen and the new apple one before I make a final decision. It was everything promised and expected.
1,Picked this up a month ago and have been very happy with the purchase. Just installed smart light bulbs. Works perfectly!
1,It was what i needed all this time and i really recommend it for anyone
1,"I love it , this was a great investment for my family"
0,Good purchase for the money but the screen is smaller than I anticipated.
1,THIS FIRE BOX IS A GOOD STREAMING DEVICE. Would recommend this product.
1,Best thing that has come out of Amazon factory for a long time $50 for a table and the underground app store makes it more worth than the price you pay. No complains.
1,"Love it... is really nice product, and not expensive."
1,great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
1,This tablet works perfect for me reading books on it. I love the option to have the blue light disabled so I can read comfortably in the dark.
0,My kids like down games and play with. It is for young children if you dont want spent a lot of money
1,"Me and my wife used the fire stick to stream shows for over a year and recently upgraded our internet to a higher speed package. To take advantage of the new speeds I thought I'd get the fire TV to use the Ethernet port on the back. Not only does it stream the shows much faster and HD works much better now, but just clicking through the menus is so much nicer with no hesitation. If you are on the fence go with the fire tv and save yourself the upgrade later. Definitely worth it."
1,i love it i wanted one for so long but couldn't bring my self to but one then i broke and i love it
1,I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
1,"Easy to use for a beginner and at a great LOW cost with many options for free or to purchase at a low cost. Never used a tablet before and LOVE it for at home or out and about where there is wi-fi available. Books, games, internet and more.....GREAT BUY!"
1,"I have the Amazon Echo in my kitchen where we run around and usually holding food in our hands while prepping or rushing out. It's nice to be able to just call out a certain song or music station to quickly start hearing some music while busy. Also, if we are in a rush to leave and want to know the temperature to make sure to have proper attire. This device just makes life a little simpler and faster."
1,"Wish I would of purchased sooner , one of best item"
1,"There are so many things the amazon echo can do. Some of our favorites are, of course, music, but also we use it every day to set timers when cooking, and ask the weather."
0,We had no customer support. We returned the item to the store.
1,Great non cheap looking tablet at a bargain compared to other brands.
0,"This is an OK tablet for the price. Does is able to do a lot of things like a more expensive tablet, but I find it to be slow. I bought it mainly as a reader, so am not to concerned about the other apps, etc. Is handy to carry in a purse for reading on the go. I have hooked it up to public wifi and seems to work OK, did not do much as don't know if any security there."
1,"If you are an avid reader, then this is a must have."
1,Purchased for an 8 year old. Prefers reading books on the tablet vs hard copy and can play games and watch videos. Well worth the $50 cost
1,I have an iPad but for reading without having being bombarded with interruptions this is way better. I use it both in and outdoors and couldn't be happier!!!!
1,This is my first e-reader and i am very happy. It is easy to read and loading books is a breeze. Highly recommended.
1,"I actually started with an Amazon Echo Dot to see how the whole thing worked without having to spend a lot of money. I was amazed at how cool and useful the Alexa system can be. We were using one Echo Dot to make lists, check the weather, set calendar appointments, set alarms, and even play rainstorm soundtracks to help sleep at night. My birthday was just a couple of weeks ago and my wife got me the Echo as the main Alexa hub in our living room. The built-in speakers sound pretty good for what they are. Definitely a huge improvement over the Dot's built-in speaker, but even the Dot has a nice sound for as small as it is. We now have 4 Echo Dots and the Echo to control all sorts of WEMO switches and outlets around the house. We already had a NEST thermostat which integrated nicely and easily. The best thing is that Alexa understands all of our different voices... even our 4 year old. He can now turn his bedroom light on by asking Alexa to do it so he doesn't have to be afraid of the dark! It really is a very cool and convenient system. My wife thought it was silly at first, but she actually loves it. It's great for playing your iHeart Radio and Pandora stations too!"
1,This is a nice tablet useful on the go and I love it
1,An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
1,Great to read at night in bed. Great detail and easy on the eyes.
1,"The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well."
1,Tablet is nice and light and durable Great for my nreices and nephews
0,U thought it was going to be like an iPad or Samsung but it's all Amazon mode and you can't turn off the lock screen ads!!!! I get tired of seeing them...
1,Great product and fits all my needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for elderly people. They seem to have no problem using it.
1,gave this to my 4 year old grandson he loves it learned to dl his games and loves to play it
1,Very satisfied with my purchase. Would recommend it to friends and family.
1,Very satisfied. Price was great. The curved screen is nice but I believe you get more TV with straight screen. I believe it is just a viewers choice. We have a sound system so I can't speak about the sound.
1,I got these for my teenage daughters and they loved them.
1,Got it on Black Friday sale and it works pretty good. Nice Hd quality and ease of use.
1,"Outstanding value, for the price I paid on Black Friday ($33), this tablet does all of the functions I use my expensive iPad for (light web browsing, email, videos, books).Sure its not as fast and the display isn't as sharp, but its less than 10% of the price of an iPad 2."
1,"Bought for a 7 yr old. Very light weight which is nice, has sufficient memory. Would be nicer if you didn't need an amazon account to set up."
1,Works just like they show on the commercials. Great product!
1,Was looking for something different but see such a good deal
1,Good tablet for younger kids as it keeps them occupied in many ways.and great learning tool.
1,My kids found this very easy to use. The Kindle has great features.
1,I bought this for myself and I am enjoying it. I like all of the information I can get. I also like that it can play music that I picked out and give me interesting facts for the day. I have it set up that I can get soothing sounds when I want to just relax. I am still learning everything that it can do.
1,Overall I think it was a great product. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
1,I like this because I can plug in anywhere. It is unnecessarily expensive.
1,It's easy to navigate and to search books and apps. My mother doesn't put it down unless she's at work
1,"Bought it during the black Friday sale, is mainly used for minecraft pocket edition. Charging port is pretty weak, though."
1,I bought this for my son and I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends
1,"We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much. Other than those two things my son loves it!"
1,My 5 year old loves it! She can order books and look at all her favorite shows
0,"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
1,The tablet is good for basic uses and is low cost.
1,Perfect size. Easy to read my favorite books on the go
1,The only concern is there is no filter on free apps. Also the parental control password is a bit cumbersome and enforcing on too many option rather than just not allowing new financial purchases.
1,Faster than the Fire stick and worth the extra money.
1,You can't go wrong either with Kindle or with the price. Very good buy.
1,"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids."
1,"Bought one for myself several months ago, have enjoyed it so much, I got one for my Mom and one for my Dad as a Christmas gift, they are not tech savvy, but found it easy to use, are enjoying them very much"
1,Before we bought this the house was always quiet. Now we stream music all the time just because it's so convenient. Really cool. Works great.
1,"This is my third Kindle. I have gifted my older ones to parents and friends as I have upgraded. This model has a great, easy to read screen, and the ability to keep a library worth of books with me during travels is great."
1,"I was very surprised with the sound from the speaker. Very easy to set up, wide range so that the system can ""hear"" my instructions from far in my room."
1,Alexa is now a great friend. Coupled with prime music it provides constant entertainment.
1,I have bought tablets for others but this is the first time I bought for myself. This is a great price for a device that does everything.
1,Love it! Great for quality movies & games for the whole family...
1,"Great price for a beginner, he is able to use it for games"
1,The person I bought this for loves it. She had another tablet that was actually more expensive but she couldn't load apps or anything to.
1,I absolutely love my amazon fire it is very user friendly. I bought one for my parents and used theirs so much I decided to buy one for myself as well.
1,Best quality around for the low price I play my games for hours
1,This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!
1,Good product! Pros: Great relieve for my eyes.Good battery life! Awesome experience for reading. Cons: The screen has no response two times.
1,It's very durable and Nice picture.its the perfect size for my 11 year old.
1,Husband loves his Alexa!!! Best gift ever. Perfect
1,"I bought this for my wife who really likes the Amazon Tablets. She said she really enjoyed the very clear picture and how fast it was. Like they say.... ""Happy Wife....Happy Life"""
1,The grandson likes the learning games that are on the tablet. You can see the progress in his learning from the time he has used it
1,Bought this as gift for my wife. She wasn't sure about it in the beginning but now loves it. She uses it for shopping list and simple searches. She even connected the Christmas lights and uses Alexa to turn them on and off. Always learning about new features and so far we have been happy with each one.
0,Swiping had to be repeated several times sometimes to get the action to respond. Returned.
1,Great tablets I bought two of these for a 5 yr and 6 yr the parental control is an awesome feature. No regrets whatsoever.
1,"One of the best Home Authomation in the business. i love how many features the Amazon echo has, and how it is still learning."
1,Switched over from the 1st gen Apple TV to the Amazon one and love it! Cut the cable cord and am using PSVUE tv on this. Works great!!
1,"great tablet! pros: good size (especially for travelling) android based so 3rd party apps can be installedcons: amazon ads will appear instead of a wallpaper on the lock screen, apparently you can pay to get rid of them which is just ridiculous can be slow when playing certain gamesnot a lot of storage space"
1,"Got this around black friday, for a great price, Been happy with it and will be buying my son one as well."
1,Love everything about it. Does everthing it says it will only better than the other devices I have. The only negative is it does not have an optical out. But that is not something that would make me not buy it again.
1,We bought this item to be a raffle prize for our Unions annual Holiday party. Winner was excited to get it. Black Friday week deals made it hard to pass up.
1,"The tablet is a good one, for such a great price. Cant beat it.It is a great tablet and my son enjoys it."
1,This product worked excellent right out of the box. Setup was very easy and a no-brainer. I am totally pleased with this product and yes I would recommend it to my friends.
1,Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16GB has been easy for me to learn how to use. I like that I can read free books from the library. It has everything I wanted and is a nice size for holding.
1,Love it great speaker as long as u have access to WiFi
1,Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
1,Fire tv loads faster than the stick. Works great with amazon prime.
1,Love how easy it is to train. Very convenient to use.
1,Controls everything in my home. I would definitely buy it again.
1,Very useful products. I like very much . Perfect side . Very easy to navigate into
1,Bought as gift. Excellent purchase. Would buy more
1,This item is the perfect tv radio treat I can ever give to my family they love it. Comes great and with everything you need to stay focused on the movies or tv shows playing.
1,"Love the device, especially to read in the dark without disturbing my wife with the lights."
1,I purchased my Fire TV to replace a Fire Stick and I am VERY HAPPY with my decision. So far I have not experienced any lag and it is so nice to be able to plug an ethernet cable into my Fire TV .
1,Good bye cable! This works great. I wish I would have purchased sooner.
1,Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
1,"It is what it is. Awesome and basic! If you use Amazon and you need a small tablet, then walaaa!"
1,"I got this Kindle so that students I work with could use Bloxels. This is an app that goes with a physical board that allows children to create their own video games. The Kindle is certainly sufficient for the task, and has stood up to about 50 early elementary aged students use!"
0,"Apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. I'm telling you, generic tablets are faster... I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great. Library app is kinda slow but still works.Perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe..."
1,Brought it for my husband and he loves it. There's fun apps and other things you can connect to.
1,"Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Easy to set up and use. We use her all the time to set alarms, check weather turn lights on and off, listen to music, etc. I liked it so much I bought one for my Mom and Brother for Christmas."
1,Excellent kindle for the price. Works great and ordering from Best Buy online was amazing.
1,I give 1 of these put every month at work. It normally goes to their kids so they are the awesome parents.
1,"This is the second Amazon Fire TV device I have purchased, which I bought as an addition for another TV in my home. This device is great because it allows you to connect to so many different TV source (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Sling TV, etc.). Also, the processing speed with this device is great and a little better than the firestick that I have."
1,"For the price, they are highly functional. Bought one for one grandson--his twin didn't think that was what he wanted for his BD, but a week later requested one1"
1,"Best tablet for the money, also great because of the color selection."
1,"I can control lights, music, shopping lists, and I am able to get my news read to me, get the weather, and order items from Amazon without ever touching my computer. So much fun."
1,My diss love their tablets. We had tried another brand but Kept having problems. Have not had any probls with these.
1,"I love that Alexa can be controlled without having to press any buttons. She has a decent amount of range that she can hear your commands from. It does take some timing to get used to her, but soon enough, you'll being to reap all the benefits of an Amazon Echo. Currently I have two Wemo plugs and Phillips Hue lightbulbs set up to my Echo and plan on adding more Alexa-compatible smart devices. I love how easy and seamless it is to get all my devices working off Alexa. It's also a bluetooth speaker and can get very loud. I love that it can connect to my amazon playlist or my spotify playlist and can play any song I want that is available. I highly recommended it to everyone that comes in my home and love to show what she can do."
1,This device works as it is advertised to work. I'm very happy with this product. It is speedy fast processing and has great graphics.
0,I have 4 of the Gen 1 Fire Tv boxes and they are good showing their age. I purchased the new FireTV only be to disappointedPros.. SD Card slotCons.. Many Apps just don't work or are buggy...Search is terrible and only gives Amazon options .. Nvidia Shield also gives my plex server option .. now that is cool... not much faster.. if at all than Gen 1
1,"I have to confess, I am sure this thing is being underutilized. It is great for weather, Flash Briefings, and other pieces of information. IFTTT? Raspberry Pi? People tell me things they can do and I'm like, ""Hey, I'm getting Philips Hue to work. That's about as advanced as I'm going right now."" Nevertheless, I do enjoy being able to call up my music from Amazon Prime Music, order pizza, and switch between my account and my wife's. Seriously enjoying it."
0,Still not able to connect to wifi so I am unable to give a recommendation.
1,"Had one previously, it was time to replace. Great for reading anywhere!"
1,Works easy in every place I go.
1,"Bought the Amazon Fire Tablet as Christmas gifts for my grandsons, ages 8 and 12. They both liked it. It has a nice size screen for them to play their games on and you can't beat the price. Better than having them play on our expensive cell phones."
1,One of the best things that I have purchased for my home entertainment
1,Wife loves the paperwhite edition of the Kindles. No glare from the sun what so ever. This replaced the Kindle 3rd generation she had for years.
1,I bought the kindle paperwhite for my aunt's birthday. She has difficulty reader paper books due to eye problems. Having the back light and ability to make the print larger really has helped her be able to enjoy reading again!!
1,"I have 90 books in my hand at all times, and will be adding more. I can read anywhere, light or dark and don't even need glasses. It was simple to put 30 books on the kindle in minutes. Wishing I had gotten one years ago. My Dad even wants one! I love my Kindle paperwhite!!!"
1,I'm very excited to say I love my fire stick. I've waited for this a long time. My neighbors say they are so happy
1,then you have a beast of a tablet. Especially when you can catch these on sale for $39.95
1,This is convenient and easy to operate. Love the shopping list - adding to the list without physically moving ---- and NO paper list to lose!!
1,Works well would buy it again. Dose everything they say it will.
1,"Very good product, clear sound, unique shape, good connection"
1,son loves this he can do alot of things on it great quality for the price
1,I got this for my two grandsons (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas. They love them.
1,"The kids love it, so I'm very happy. that's all that matters to me"
1,I love the auto dim feature for reading at night! I have no problem reading in sunlight either. Can be held with one hand and turn the page with the same hand. I have 3 other kindles and I use this one all the time.
1,"I love this Kindle. It syncs without needing to prompt for it, downloads new books quickly and the backlighting is effective even at low levels so I don't disturb my sleeping husband when I want to read in bed. Its compact and lightweight size make it easy to carry anywhere and comfortable to hold."
1,"I like that it has parental control and a curfew on it, what I don't like is the charger it seemed to have a short in it or doesn't charge fast it's a slow charge but she loves it and it does way more then I expected. She is able to download books she can't use the internet because of the child mode it's a great tablet for children and adults"
1,Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
1,"This item allowed me to turn my tv into not only a smart tv, but a game console. Is great for family games."
1,"It is a great product for the price, does need the expansion card for memory!!!"
1,"My kids love these tablets, they can use these tablets for school and leisure. I can manage how much time they have to use their devices and can add additional accounts to each tablet and control each account separately. This was a great buy!"
1,We gott this at a great price on black friday for my nephew. Lowest price we found anywhere.
1,My daughter loves this; she is reading voraciously
1,"Good sound, easy set up. This little speaker is so fun to use. It is great for me as I have Prime Music, although other music apps work just as well."
1,"The best product to come out of Amazon. Just love my Echo, works well as smart hub"
1,"Great e-reader. Has an awesome battery life, great for traveling or hanging at home. So awesome to have thousands of books available to you. I feel like book prices on ereaders have been rising, and that's unfortunate. I have two at home and I love them though!"
1,"I would buy this again, I like the voice system. and I would recommend it to my friends."
1,Purchased during Black Friday sale 2016 as an impulse buy. Great little tablet and great value!
1,The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
1,This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
1,This is my 2nd fire and I was so sad when it crashed. Love my new one but giving 4 stars bc the need to update the charger at the bottom. It sticks and you can easily break the inside I wish they would change that
1,I was actually a usability tester on the very first Kindle and I'd always thought about buying one. After using the Kindle app on various tablets (iPad and Samsung) I finally realized that what I was mostly using the tablets for was the Kindle App.Buying one was a no-brainer and the Paperwhite is excellent. The Bookerly font is exceedingly readable and the backlighting is adjustable so that I don't keep my significant other awake when I'm reading in bed. It's lightweight and the perfect size for putting in the pocket of my cargo shorts or in a jacket pocket.
1,love the Kindle paperwhite. It is so light weight but best of all I can read outside. The light also allows reading at night and does not bother my spouse.Only problem I do not like the case I purchased online and no covers at best buy or target
1,I chose this item to as a giveaway for an office raffle. I have the same one at home and I love it!
1,Fast streaming of your favorite shows and games lots of memory and sd card for more memory HD view with 4K capabilities
1,Love this tablet. Great for reading which is why I bought one.
1,"Love the case, table works very well, easy to download game and apps, but the life of the battery is not great. The battery fully charged only last about 3-4 hours"
1,I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.
0,"This tablet conked out on me the first day I powered it on. The Amazon symbol came up and never went past that screen. I was highly annoyed because I purchased it as a first to send it out of the country. My biggest mistake was trusting that everything would work fine, instead I should've powered on the device to ensure everything was fine."
1,One of my major issues with e-book ls is using screens and the annoying glare. While the paper white still isn't a printed page it does a good job of getting close. With the backlight optional it retains the benefit of being able to read at night too. I love my iPad but prefer the Kindle Paperwhite for all my e-books.
1,Is a great product and a fantastic entertainment. The hole family is around it at home washing videos and series. It is also compatible with others programs and apps.
1,I love this kindle. Faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing pages and/or books. The self adjusting light levels works very good in mine. Having the option on the frame to change pages is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead; this is the only reason why I don't give it a 5.I love this reader
1,Excellant starter tablet . I love that it is preset with children in mind and I love the colors.
1,"Only 4 stars because I found it very confusing at first. I had a Kindle before found it very easy to find what I needed to do. The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy. All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is great."
1,Great table. In fact t am typing this review with it now
1,"The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite was a gift to my husband. He is very happy with it for several reasons. Reading from the non-reflective screen is effortless, and he can adjust the size of the characters. He can take notes and highlight parts of the text. Two really neat features are: 1. If you take notes on a book that you borrowed from the library, those notes will still be there even after you return the book. So, if you happen to borrow the same book a few weeks later, when you open the book on your e-reader, your notes will be there. 2. In a complicated story with lots of characters, the e-reader keeps track of who is who. In a paper book, you would have to flip the pages back and forth to figure that out. No need to do this with the e-reader."
1,Have not had it long enough to give a proper review
1,"Bought this item as a Christmas present. The price was a steal of a deal! It was easy to set up and the kids loved it. I bought a black, a blue and a red. I even bought 2 more for my friends kids. The children loved it!"
1,Such a great tablet! Got my mother it for Christmas and she loves it!
1,Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.
1,"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
1,Bought it as a Christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
1,I could plug into an Ethernet outlet for faster speeds than wireless. It works great
1,"Great for the kids, picture quality is great and it is durable."
1,"This product was a replacement for the one my husband had which was an older generation. He loves the paperwhite, much easier to read in daylight, he does take it to work with him. He says it is overall better in many ways."
1,"I didn't want to spend a fortune on something, I just needed a quality tablet to read my books, check email, play on Pinterest and Twitter, etc. This price is phenomenal for the quality. I actually bought one as a gift a few weeks later."
1,It's the faster modem I ever have now my computer not going down. Also I bought a amazonfire tv nice for the prize thanks.
1,This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
1,"Still learning all the things it can do but solo it is a nice quick answer system and music player. I now have mine hooked to HUE lights, Honeywell Thermostat, and a Belkin outlet with a heater. Nice to have Alexa turn on my kitchen lights when I'm running in groceries."
1,I purchased the kindle fire for my six year old daughter and she loves it. She already knows how to work it.
1,I have both the FIRESTICK and AMAZON TV. I choose to to get the AMAZON TV for better streaming and live channels. Thus far I am satisfied.
1,"In an effort to cut the cord we purchased the Amazon Fire TV. It has all the apps we needed: Vue, Hulu, Netflix, Prime (obviously) as well as HBO, Showtime and the network TV station apps. It's easy to navigate and with a little setup we're cable free! Would totally recommend."
1,"I was reluctant to buy this product out of fear of it not being used. As it turns out, my daughters and I use it constantly. So much in fact, we now have an echo in each of our bedrooms as well to help with studying and for music. Excellent product."
1,This is now my third kindle reader. I have been exceedingly impressed with them. The paper white is the best so far. So happy that I no longer need the bulky clip on lights to read at night!
1,Great Tablet.Performs very well so far.Pictures and graphics are of very good quality.
1,Great product highly recommended it!! Ended getting two
1,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
1,"Its like a personal assistant. Alexa saves time, I don't need to go my phone or laptop. I just ask! Its amazing! Love it!"
1,"I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee"
1,Auto Updates at all times keeps you current with weather news sports and a great alarm clock with 360 sound
1,Replaced paper white with voyage...amazing screen!
1,Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
1,It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...
1,Amazon Fire TV works great. Picture and streaming is fantastic.
0,"We had two AppleTVs - one in the master bedroom and one in the living room. We could not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other TV. We got the AmazonTV to remedy this. While it did rectify this problem, we find we prefer the ease and simplicity of the AppleTV over the AmazonTV. The Amazon is cumbersome and difficult to navigate."
1,Easy to navigatePerfect for little ones Buy a screen protector too !
1,Plug it in and connect to your network. It's that simple. Love it!
1,This tablet for ~$35 is an amazing deal. It's almost a no-brainer to get one for any long family trip.
1,An acceptable e-reader.You will need to spend $20 to remove the ads
1,"The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
1,Works very good and fast!!! Great screen resolution.
1,Had this for 2 days before I cut my cable off. Works great with lots of apps.
1,I didn't realize what I was missing. Alexa keeps life in my home. Glad I invested in this product! Can't wait to get home!
1,"Its a simple tablet, but works great, good picture, you can do most the same as other major named tablets.It works for me."
1,Great..I love it..Glad I got it..My nephew loves it.
0,"Worked good for a month, the kids loved it but then just went black and wouldn't come back on. Sending it back to get a new one with the warranty."
1,Bought this tablet so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop when traveling. Didn't think I'd use it at home but I find all sorts of thing to use it for there too. Sure my phone does some of those things but the bigger screen is easier.I also didn't think I'd use it as a reader but I slowly got hooked. For $40 it's a real bargain.
1,Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
1,"Excellent product at the right price. For those with light sensitivity, this product is perfect."
1,"After much contemplation between a Kindle and a Nook, I went with Kindle due to the number of kindle book purchases. However I LOVE the choice I made. I wanted to be able to read at night without the light. I can with this one and if I fall asleep then nothing is left on. And I love not having to carry my heavy technical books around now either! VERY happy with this purchase!!"
1,Happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best
1,"We are pleased with our Echo! Alexa is very useful. We utilize her to change the temp via our Nest, setting multiple timers is extremely helpful when cooking, and we play music via Spotify and check the following day's weather almost every evening!"
1,Dad loves it love love love it love it love it love
1,Was skeptical about getting rid of cable...love Amazon fire! So many choices and so much cheaper!
1,"I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my niece, and found it on sale for a great price. It was easy to set up, booted up quickly, and works perfectly for her. It's not high end by any means, but it is a great little tablet."
1,It's exactly what I was looking for. My sister was very happy with it and it meets her needs.
1,It is fast and affordable streaming player. All app are supported.
1,Loving my Echo. I mostly listen to music. And ask random facts but it was definitely a plus for me.
1,Took some getting use to but finally got it set up and love it.
1,"very convenient, perfect size and easy on the eyes. I never though I would stop reading paperbacks, but this makes reading a library of different books much more convenient."
1,Upgraded from an original Kindle. Absolutely love it. Even better than my wife's Kindle PaperWhite.
1,Great gift for kids. Play a long time with battery life.
1,"This tablet is perfect for me, my kids, and for on the go. It's a brand I trust."
1,"Really like my Kindle Paperwhite. Very nice feel, responsive, intuitive menus, and easy to read."
0,I took it back the day after purchasing it. The screen looks like you are scrolling through old news print. Blacks out each moment you move it. I thought it was a defect but nope. According to the geek squad that's just the way it is now :(
1,"Unable to use for anything but Kindle and this severely limits its usefulness. The screen is very readable in sunlight, nice feature."
1,"I had been holding out for an iPad mini, but when I took a look at this tablet, it became clear that the iPad was a waste of money. I am really happy with this tablet."
1,"The Amazon Echo revolutionized my home. I connected to my spotify, my phillips Hue and everything else. It is a gem of an idea to make voice control work your whole home. The only thing I would say is that it should come with the voice control remote. Once I got it, as a separate purchase, It completed the outstanding experience I so desperately desired. I will tell you that if you don't have the Echo, shame on you. This is the future and it is here now. I love it."
1,I love this unit. The picture quality is awesome the system ui is easy to use and there are a ton of streaming services offered
1,"I love this product. I get to see a bunch of movies, and tv shows."
1,"This product makes life easier, smart home integration or just shopping lists... makes life easier."
1,I got this for 35 on black Friday which is the best deal for a tablet but still 0 getting this for 50 is a good deal
1,Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
1,"Kindle is great as long as you only use it to read books. The web interface is pretty rough, so I put books on it straight from my computer. I love that you can e-mail files directly to your kindle! The lighting is also much improved from the last time I had an e-reader (the Nook) and is perfect whether you're reading inside, outside, or in the dark."
0,I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn’t appreciate.
1,Can't beat a tablet for $50 that actually works!!!
1,"Bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10"" screen (yet)."
1,This fire box has a lot of applications on the box.
1,It's much faster than the older model. Has an option for more memory add on.
1,I bought these kindle fire tablets for Christmas presents for the grandkids... They love them. Good durable tablets at a great price.
1,"At sub $50, the kindle fire pretty much falls under disposable. That said it is a fantastic little tablet, good enough to do almost anything you would want to do.Only downside is the mono speaker, it is a little of an issue when listening to music over the speakers. If wearing headphones, the sound quality is ok and you get stereo."
0,The tablet I bought was not what I expected and I wanted to return.
1,Perfect for my child. Only issue I have with it is the advertisements that pop up when you turn it on.
1,I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.
1,"This was to replace an older fire tablet that was worn out.It was the right size for my wife to carry around,also it was much lower price than the original."
1,Alexa has changed our lives...get one...get one now
1,"my new paperwhite kindle is easy to use , super light weight- a real joy.I have been reading on my iPad, but find the lighter weight, smaller size better. Thought the smaller screen might be hard to get used to - but not really a problem."
1,"I love this Amazon fire thing so much, I said bye bye to direct tv.. This will also save me over $100 a month. That's just icing on the cake for me!!!!!!!"
0,"Love this kindle as its light, user friendly and great purchase"
1,Great product! Easy on the eyes in the day or night.
1,Great purchase.. Bought for my two children. They love it
1,Love all the apps available more than any other streaming Device by far with 4K content .
1,"Love The Picture And Apps, Could Be Better Without The Apps That You Don't Want And Add Your Own"
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it! No problems reading on the beach.
1,Fun for the kids to play with in their spare time.
1,Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
1,One of the best products ever created! Love Alexa!
1,"Better then I thought, very useful and easy to use. Set up was a snap and works great"
1,I believe this is the best Amazon device because of the portability. Quality seems good. Works well with no problems so far. It's a great portable Bluetooth speaker with alexa.
1,Lovethe product. Small compact and take it in doors or outdoors
1,"Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
1,The product is good and easy to operate. I guarantee that you won't regret buying it.
1,"I work in natural speech and language processing, so I'm quite familiar with the technology behind the echo. I purchased my echo to test an Alexa skill that I'd written. While the process of connecting it to wifi is clunky, the echo is otherwise quite easy to use. I'm often impressed at how well the farfield ASR does as recognizing my speech, even when I'm yelling from another room. My wife and I soon found ourselves wanting another one to put downstairs."
0,Can't stream smoothly unless plugged directly into the modem. Buffering was horrible (did not have this problem with Roku). Even plugged in it has some trouble with buffering at times. Only bought this because I got Playstation Vue and it only runs on certain systems. Unless you actually need the Amazon Fire to stream something only it can stream I would not recommend it. Roku is a much better system.
1,"Bought for my elderly parents and they love it, best ever"
1,I got this for my mother in law for Christmas she loves it
1,"I upgraded from a Nook Glowlight which I had dropped and cracked (the shaft of light emanating through the tiny crack was beginning to burn into my retina, so I figured it was time to upgrade). I really like the ease of this device - purchases download to it directly, and if you have existing files, you can email them directly to the kindle and it will format them accordingly. The definition on the paperwhite is really nice, and the backlight is gentle on your eyes (crucial if you are a late night reader like me). I have the ""special offers"" version, and it is not intrusive at all, just appears on your lock screen. Battery has been great so far.If you are an Amazon Prime member, they even throw you a free ebook each month. And yes, I bought a protective cover for it this time!"
1,"I didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but I am shocked at how well he navigates it ON HIS OWN. He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool. I love it, and he does, too."
1,"This is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves this. The charger can be a little tricky at times, so I do have to be the one to plug it in. I've made sure to download a few of his favorite things on it for when we are offline & it's worked just fine. I will be buying an SD card soon to give him more room though, but we haven't run into any issues so far."
1,Good table for the kids haven't had any issues. Love it.
1,"Exactly what I wanted, great reading at night or in a bright day."
1,just what I was looking for to putin my guest room. It has a good picture
1,"I got this for my daughter after the tablet that she had before broke (it wouldn't charge, it wasn't a kindle). She loves it. I love the fact that I could put a memory card into it to give her more memory."
1,I bought kindles for my twins last November and I loved this product so much that I purchased them for my triplets for their birthday.
1,Got the tablet for my daughter for her birthday tablet worked great but the charger cable did not work.
1,Very pleased with my amazon fire tablet. Reasonably priced and works great.
1,Maybe im just partial to anything Amazon does but this tablet rocks!
1,The screen is well lit and easy to read. The compact size is also quite nice.
0,I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.
1,"This was a gift for my girlfriend, she loves the paperwhite. Screen is great and the 300 PPI is very sharp. Highly suggested."
1,I bought this for my niece for her 9th birthday and she loves it! I would recommend it if you have kids
1,The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
1,I am 75 and enjoy it very much. Great for reading.
1,"I wasn't expecting to purchase the Amazon Fire but, I wanted something smaller to tote around with me when I needed to instead of a big lap top. The screen is crisp and clear, and this tablet is faster than I expected when surfing around web pages. Glad I got this!"
1,The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire.
1,"Purchased for the hands free interaction. Great speaker for music and amazon music variety surpasses XM. Being able to say ""Alexa add to grocery list"" when I need something instead of having to find phone or pad and pen. Once at store, I can call up list made by Alexa and I am all set. Looking forward to setting it up to turn on and off lights throughout our home."
1,"Though I was partial to my Nook, I kept getting little broken pixel light spaces on the screen. Switched to Kindle and I was pleasantly surprised at the visibility of the screen and how light it is. I read in bed every night and it is very comfortable to hold."
1,Brought for grandmother as a Christmas gift because she wanted and iPad and we. Thought she'd never figure out how to use one so I bought this as a beginners tablet and she loves it
1,Alexa (Echo) is amazing. I chose the tower because of the better speaker. So glad I did. Liked it so much I bought one for my son.
1,First of all i like the price !!! Faster and take good photos
1,Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them!
1,"Easy to instal, easy setup, simple clean navigation, love this product"
1,I was impressed how good this tablet is for the price that i paid. Really good tablet for the kids.
1,"Great price for the kids to keep them entertain.i love the price for this item , it didn't break the bank. I would recommend this to everyone."
1,We wanted I good inexpensive table to get our feet wet. This is a good one if you are comfortable getting your apps from Amazon. I do find the processor to be a little slow at times.
1,"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price."
1,This is one if not the bes streamer ever it has aGreat picture
1,"Easy to setup, and install. Only took a few minutes to hookup and watching movies. Simple to use, and navigate."
1,We haven't had any issues with this super affordable tablet
1,"Bought to replace older Kindle Fire. Perfect for what I need. Use mainly for e-books, apps, web browsing, and streaming occasional movies/shows."
1,I love my fire TV and I love best buys service.They deliver just like they say.
1,"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
1,"This tablet proves a great value for browsing the web, storing photos and using Amazon. The sale price is truly hard to beat!"
1,a good purchse for my mother-in-law with failing eyesight
1,I previously owned the kindle fire hd 8.9. I wanted a smaller tablet and this one is perfect. I use my kindle for books only and I have more than enough room.
1,"Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too."
0,Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
1,I have this and the dot. Very little difference between the two other than size. Maybe it plays music a little louder thanks to bigger speaker but if this wasn't on sale I would've stuck with the Echo Dot. 4 stars because of the functionality of Alexa product in general
1,The lady that helped me was very professional and knowledgeable. She understood what I was looking for let me know that she would have to order it. She did just that and it showed up 2 days earlier than originally told.
1,"i love to use it, i read several books in my beautiful kindle"
1,I bought this tablet for my 8 year old granddaughter. She loves it!!! The display is very clear and easy to see. The set up allows for you to choose child safe settings with PIN protected parent lock to help protect young users from inappropriate content. This is well worth the affordable cost!
0,"I'm mostly happy, but like so many electronics, this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just can't get away from. There is no way to identify the aps you want to see first, and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell. It takes many clicks to get where I want, and the voice only works for purchases from Amazon, everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks."
1,"We have been quite impressed with Alexa! We use her often, and my loves having her to entertain the kids. I do wish it were a bit easier to connect her to some of my devices (it was hard to connect her to two separate GE Air Conditioners, things just have to be set up in a very specific way, which wasn't always user friendly). But over all, we have been happy with this purchase!"
1,"I like the concept of the product. I'm still learning how to use it, but it seems that it may be to pricey to really get the full benefits."
1,"Needless to say..Kindle Paperwhite is awesome product worth of millions as it holds invaluable books in 4GB space as well as in amazons cloud ... Its 6"" anti-glare touch-screen display with 300 ppi resolution gives you a real feel of reading... its night mode gives the flexibility to read books in dark... Battery backup lasts for days....perfect for book lovers.. give it a try.. all the best.."
1,"Bought as a gift for in-laws, had some issues setting up as their router was through AT&T. No fault of Alexa, but took a while to fix. Good quality speaker and fun to ask Alexa questions."
1,Very good for me put it in my purse or use it in bed love it.
1,It's a great tablet for the price. Gift for my grandson..
1,Far and away blows away the Echo Dot in terms of sound quality. The higher cost is offset by the need to purchase a decent quality bluetooth speaker for the Dot.
1,It has so much functionality and is so easy to use. The speakers are great so.
1,Store is very clean never takes longer the an hour for my items to be ready for pick up.. device works great has received the lowest price
1,The whole family loves it.................... .. .
1,I love the ease of setup and the accuracy of the voice recognition. My new favorite aspect of the product is building all of the rules and IFTT solutions that are available. What a great flexible product that is way more than a music speaker.
1,The product it's left works GREAT! Especially compared to the Stick. It is so much faster and has more memory that you are not constantly get the low memory notifications. Only problem is the lack of available apps on the App Store.
1,Just make sure you have good internet speed and you will be all set.
1,I love it would recommend to a friend .Have fun with family asking questions and great with music.
1,I bought this tablet for it's inexpensive price and quality. it's meant to be a portal to be able to purchase more products from Amazon and services but it really is a high-quality product.
1,Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.
1,"You can go cheap for the regular kindle, but in my opinion its worth the extra money to get the paperwhite model. If you had both beside each other or sometimes read at night, you'd go with the paperwhite too."
1,"I'm a little challenged when it comes to stuff like this , but it's many functions makes it fun to learn new things ."
1,It's small and fairly open platform with wide array of third party services
0,"i got this tablet for traveling. Just games, reading, stuff like that so I didn't need anything fancy. It works but it lags on games and the battery life is horrible."
1,It is a good device consider its low cost. Display isn't great plus the Amazon version of the OS is inferior comparing to Android.
1,"The Amazon Fire Stick is a great way to access the vast library of Amazon and other content in any tv. You'll need an HDMI input on the television, a power outlet and reliable wi-fi. Get one for every TV in your house."
1,I have been using multiple fire sticks for the past two years. The Fire TV blows them away in speed and quality. I would recommend it if you subscribe to amazon prime
1,Love the ease of using the Kindle. This version also has a built in camera!
1,Great product. I would highly recommend with the increased storage and ungraded firmware.
1,"This item is ideal for kids to play games and a whole lot more.,my hubby even have one and he enjoys his and I love the picture quality."
1,My wife loves the Echo and we would recommend to any of our friends
0,My Echo hasn't updated to the latest version that allows for hands-free operation. I'm not sure what the problem is.
1,This tablet is perfect for someone who just likes to cruise the web and play games! Perfect size and speed!
1,Light weight user friendly tablet. Does everything that expensive tablets do and more.Best value for the money.
1,"This Kindle is great. I ended up returning it for the simple one, because the light didn't bring that much value for me."
1,I got this on black Friday for my mom for christmas. She loves it. She never likes my presents so this is great.
1,"For $50 you cant go wrong, there are other no name brands that cost more that are worst. Didn't need to put much thought into buying one. Great christmas gift for anyone of all age groups."
0,"Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas."
1,"Echo was easy to install and start using. I thought I would have difficulty getting it to work. I just plugged it in, downloaded the app and began using it!"
1,There is so many things you can do with this box. Its so entertaining.
0,"The Fire TV is a good device with a powerful processor and the best Playstation Vue interface. However, it can be frustrating to access the channels you've added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all - one by one. The Roku allows you to arrange your channels in whatever order you choose. The Roku has the most channel options - including Vudu (a channel not available on the Fire TV). Still, if you intend to use the Playstation Vue service you'll be much happier with the Fire TV."
1,I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
1,I love that this kindle is easy to use and very good for the price. My 7yr old daughter has one and husband. Bothe beginners and they are using it easily.I do not like that it is not HD quality screen and pics.
0,"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
1,"The basic Kindle Fire is a perfect tablet for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles of an IPad. I bought this one for my daughter to replace her first generation Fire. She primarily uses her tablet to read books, play games, and surf the web. This product provides all those options at a great price."
1,Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
1,"As my grandparents love to watch Japanese TV (live stream local Japanese channels) and they do not have a SmartTV, they were paying near $40/mos. to watch 3 chnls through the local provider TimeWarner. However, I realized they only watch 1 out of the 3 chnls since they only show certain shows and news. I found FujiTV live through many searches and I was able to download the apk onto the FireTV via Kodi. Through FujiTV I subscribed a month subscription for less than $30 and my grandparents are able to watch 70 channels with 7 days playback and full program list for all channels with the ease of using the FireTV remote. The interface of the Amazon Fire TV is simple and easy to use. As for the quality of connection, picture, and durability, they were all up to par and does what we want it to do and more. Whenever my grandparents are not watching their Japanese shows, I use it to stream the movies/shows via HULU."
1,The Amazon Kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed. The device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet.
1,"Highly recommended, only flaw is it needs more data to draw from."
1,"Wife bought this as gift, she was going to buy the newest one but they recommended this one instead, good call!!"
1,No problems my daughter loves it we used rewards points and got the warranty
1,"I use it daily to check emails, social media and recipes."
1,The Echo has been a smash hit. It works well with devices and is easy to set up. The access and use is very simple. My son is taking it to college with him and he loves it.
1,"Okay, not all that great. I thought it would do more."
1,The paper white kindle is great. Makes reading in the dark is so much easier.
1,"I mainly use Anazon Echo for streaming radio stations, shopping list, alarms/timers. Volume on the device is pretty decent. Kids love asking Alexa all sorts of questions too. I wish I could turn it on to a radio station instead of an alarm. Overall a good purchase."
1,Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment.
1,"I got this over the Roku Ultra which is 4K compatible, Roku was garbage. The amazon fire tv is a must if you have a Amazon account. Its a great streamer, I have no buffering problems."
1,Great buy! Bought it to replace a first generation Kindle.
1,This thing is pretty awesome. It's lighter and thinner than my previous one. I am a fan.
1,Easy to navigate! Easy to understand how to load apps!
1,"I love using Alexa. She will play music when asked, plays games, answers questions and starts my day with a good morning and ends each evening with a good night!"
1,"Didn't spend a whole lot of cash on this, bought it as a gift for a child for Christmas. Has all the functionality that most other tablets have. Screen might not be as nice but for the money you can't really complain"
1,"I bought this for my father for Christmas. He has a smartphone, but the screen is getting a little too smail for him to read, so I thought I smaller tablet might be nice. I was right. He absolutely loves his Kindle!"
1,"I love this tablet/kindle. I can access email, Facebook, play simple games, shop online and read my books."
1,Great product for all members of the family to have fun with
1,This was so much fun after we set it up in our kitchen.
1,"Im an Amazon fan so it was an easy decision to buy. Good battery life for music, movies and general web stuff. Fits my hand size well. Powers up quick. Screen brightness adjusts to any conditions. I would recommend buying in store cause I had to return 2 of them with a dead pixel. The one I have now has been good for several months."
1,"I decided to get an Echo when I kept reading about everything Alexa could do. Not disappointed. She now controls our TV, Security, Front door and Shopping Lists with ease. And, she understands me, unlike Siri. Love her."
0,"Navigating around the tablet can be somewhat confusing at times, but for the price you cannot get a better tablet."
1,"Easy installation and easy to use. I use it for timers, music, weather, information and am anxious to try using more features in the near future as I have had it only about 3 weeks. I can't imagine not having it anymore."
1,Bought for my son. Have had these before and they really like them.
0,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa"
1,It has a good sized screen. Very good wifi receiver. Overall good product.
1,Its a awesome tablet and very durable for children
1,"Hard to find any gripes for this device. Serves its purpose brilliantly. The backlight is excellent, and the built in dictionary is great."
1,This is so much faster than the fire stick. It also provides full support for sling tv and PlayStation vue which Apple TV has not. This has replaced our Apple TV as the primary streamer.
1,I recommend the Fire to all its teriffic and easy to operate it has a great battery I use it daily you would love it !!!!!!!!!!!
1,I love that it is lightweight and easy to use. My local librarian showed me how to borrow e-books and it is so simple to do. Perfect for me.
1,I have an amazon account and with the fire tv I am able to watch everything
1,I saw this on sale and used points so it cost me $49 haha suckered who pay 160 anyway it works awesome and sets up in a few mins on sale for $100
1,"I bought these fore my grandkids, and they love them"
1,There's not much to say about the Fire. It's a great tablet that offers a lot of the price. Highly recommended!
1,"I bought this kindle for my 6 year old and he loves it. It is a great buy for the price. I also purchased the micro SD card and expanded the storage for my son's games and music. It is a bit different than my Kindle Fire and a little harder for me to get used to, but he loves it. I highly recommend it."
1,Got this for my Neice she loves it. I had previously purchased one for my Mother.
1,This is a great streaming device. Easy to use and user friendly. It says it plays 4K which is a plus. I've streamed Amazon and ps Vue on here and read that games can be played too. I am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and has voice control which is great. I just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad. It takes getting used to. Overall it is great addition to my streaming devices.
1,I'm an avid reader....I have 7 different Kindles including the Oasis and Voyage. The Paperwhite quickly became my favorite! The battery life is outstanding!!!
1,"I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."
1,Love the idea of AI and this is easy to use. Even my 3 year old grandson knows how to play music or turn on lights. Then I can't pass up a great price.
1,I love this KIndle. You really can't beat it for the price. It does a lot.
1,I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep.
1,Had to get a few inexpensive tablets for my kids so far and the battery life on this is great! Speed of apps is good as well.
1,I bought this to use mainly outdoors because my iPad had too much reflection on the screen. The white background works great outdoors. Very easy to read.
1,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.
1,I purchased the tablet as a gift for my children. It was very cost effective and works great for their needs.
0,"I like the product, but I dislike that you have to download every app. I believe it should come with at least a few basic apps."
1,Enjoying it immensely. Recommend to anyone. Perfect size to carry in your bag.
1,give the tablets to my grandsons they love them and would buy them as gifts
1,"I bought two of these for my children. They are not powerful, they do not have a bright screen, and the battery life is ok. But they are cheap options for kids to have tablets and helps keep down the fighting. App store is not good, but keeps kids entertained and that is why I bought these. Great value for the price."
1,Bought this for my father and he loves it easy to use
0,More intelligent than siri however speaker performance is lacking when used for music. Sonos play1 or bose soundlink has much better sound.
0,I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much.
1,"Works great, good sound quality, easy and fun to use."
1,"I have loved Kindles from the first time I turned one on. I now read about 12 books a year (that's a lot for me). I finally upgraded to the Paperwhite for the backlight feature. I take it with me everywhere in case I have an extended wait time somewhere. But I mostly use it in bed. The size makes it easy to hold. It's a lot better then holding a cumbersome book and doesn't hurt as much when I start to doze off and drop it on my face. I have set the text size big enough to read without my glasses, get in bed, turn on the backlight, and read in the dark. Good for reading in sunlight too. I only read books with my Kindle, so I didn't see the need to buy the Fire. And I only needed the Wi-Fi version (no 3G desired). I also didn't see the need to pay $80 more for the Voyage."
1,"I thought i would love my amazon echo before i bought it, but now that ive had the chance to use it its just not such a big deal !"
1,"Great tablet at a very good price, it works for everyone in the house from downloading apps/games to reading."
1,It is nice to get information I normally don't here and to get the type of music I listen to played when I ask...
1,Does everything you need a tablet to do in a small package. I gave it as a gift and the recipient can't put it down. I have the first generation Kindle Fire and I still love it!
1,Using the Kindle to read books and stream videos is very easy and enjoyable.
1,Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
1,"I purchased this item before b but did not buy a case for protection. I bought two. One for each grandson, They are three days apart. This time I've bought them cases and the parents are happy. They have learned how to navigate them and have learned so much from them. They both are advanced preschoolers, Thanks to this investment. Thank you for b bringing the price down, this has inspired me to have my sister purchase some for her five grands. We are all happy. Thank you again."
1,"I am no stranger to amazon tablet a must have, for the budget buyer can't go wrong :)"
1,My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places
1,Bought this for my dad. I like this Amazon product very much.
1,"Yes, I use my Kindle to read books, but I especially like sending document Pdfs, such as my daily prayers, to my Kindle email account to be converted so I can view them on my Kindle. I also appreciate that it has built in lights and I can make the font larger - I don't need my eyeglasses! Perfect for my reading needs almost anywhere."
1,I purchased a Kindle reader a few years ago and wasn't impressed but this one is much lighter and has an easier to read screen...and it's backlit for night reading. This one is a keeper.
1,I bought my daughter one an she literary have been on it every sense I purchased I would definitely approve this on the market for the little ones cheap and worth every penny
1,Setting up today with wall bracket to make television fit better in the room
1,Love this! Alexa is so cool you feel like you're living in the jettsons
1,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Lighter in weight, no glare. The white background is easier to read than the previous model she had."
1,I like the way I can read many books and magazines as well as play various games on my kindle.
1,I bought one for both my kids and they love it. We are very happy with the purchase.
1,The product works great. If you need help using it just look it up on youtube
1,I like this device a lot. Very good battery life and like the fact this is linked to my Amazon account for books and music.
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet is lightweight and easy to use. Great for Kindle books. Small enough to carry anywhere. If I'm waiting somewhere, I'm able to read while waiting."
1,"I love it, only thing is that it discharges real quick"
1,So glad had opportunity to purchase for only $33! Amaazing tablet for Septagenarian. Always wanted a Kindle but not at original prices. Will use more for internet but also as reader. Not into games but would be fabulous for a youngster. Prime is great!
0,Everything seems to work as intended. The available storage is small when you include the pre loaded apps. I should have known that would be the case.
1,"The 4K model exceeded my expectations as far as a streaming media player for the home entertainment system. It is easy to use even for a beginner. I like the voice command remote feature which eliminates a lot of button pressing. There are a lot of apps availabe and it integrates with Amazon prime customers. Overall, I highly recommend this box to those who like to spend a lot of time in front of their tv."
1,Nice tablet. I purchased this tablet for my mom as well as my daughter they both love this tablet. Good for general web surfing and loading books.
0,It's nice but there are too many specific lines to remember to get her to talk to you. Also your family gmail calendar does NOT connect if on iCloud with iPhones so she will not know your families calendar. Needs updates and she should be able to answer you by a question and not a specific way you must say things with the skills
1,"Great price, sounds great ,it can do alot of stuff"
1,"i really like the voyage, it looks great, and worth the money."
1,Works well though I ended up getting the HD8 because of the bigger screen as storage.
1,I am satisfied with my tablet. I bought three of them for my grandchildren for christmas. I like the games and reading. And I really like the parental feature on it especially how things are in the world of the internet. Its always good to know that someone else is watching your back!
0,I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
1,"I like the large display, it is very readable for this old man's eyes. The colors are vibrant and crisp. It plays videos well. I love the Amazon Underground absolutely free apps and games. The only drawback for me is the Amazon modified Android OS. I'm slowly figuring it out. The cameras leave a lot to be desired, although they are not the reason I bought this. It is a bit heavy for me, but with a folio it is easier to hold. I also bought the tempered glass screen protector."
1,This product is good for kids. Has options to put different users to have set up how each person wants it and can set parent controls.
1,My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
1,The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos
1,perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in
0,First day after purchasing the tablet the screen turned green. Since then it has given us problems with the screen turning green. I will be returning the item.
1,Grabbed this tablet for my daughter for her birthday she loves it
1,This thing is pretty awesome. Thank you for the fast shipping
1,"Speaker and microphone works great. Works great with Samsung Smarthings. Search engine results could be better. I haven't had much luck at controlling my Dish Hopper consistently, but I may be doing something wrong on my end since I haven't used it with Dish very often."
1,I had an older Kindle but always had to have a light to read at night. I love the Kindle Paper White...its fantastic!!
1,"Kindle Voyage is great, screen resolution is awesome, love the new page turn buttons (I missed these ones from my previous Kindle keyboard)."
1,I used a lot of different streaming boxes over the years I've never had a lot of success with them until now these Amazon boxes are extremely well built and provide excellent content
1,Never thought I would buy something like this but absolutely love it
1,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
1,You can't beat this for the price. The Internet is fast and a good reader.
1,"Bought 2 for Grandkids (8 & 11 yrs old) Christmas present. Easy to use, great entertainment, games, access to all their sites. They Love it!!!"
1,"The Kindle is just great for my mom, who would mostly just read on it and download the bible."
1,"I'd been givin'em as presents, and I'll do it again"
1,"This is the third Vizio TV I've had, all still working, even after nine years of almost continuous service"
1,I wanted a reader that was easy to use indoor or outside. I am very pleased and so glad I purchased this product. Ordering books is also very easy.
1,"Got this for my 7 year old because of the parental controls I heard about. So far it's been a decent tablet and has some nice controls, but it would be better if the controls could be customized by day and specific apps instead of all apps and by weekday/weekend."
1,Just what she needed to keep her interested in short games & letters
1,Love my Alexia! Best buy this year! Love the freedom of requesting music verbally and increasing or decreasing the loudness. The kids love asking her questions and I really like getting the weather and not having to wait on the TV for the news.
1,Received as a Christmas gift and it has met all of my expectations!
1,The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
1,Great for beginners I like reading on the beach and I like to read in the shade that it works and it works great
0,Bought this for my six-year old Daughter.Easy to navigate.The only knock is that is doesn't have expandable memory.
1,Worth having in the home. Also compatible with almost all Wi-Fi products.
1,Very cool product.Did have a little difficulties setting up but worth it.Still learning all it has to offer.
1,I love my Kindle Fire!!! Except for making telephone calls I can do so much. I specifically purchased my Fire because I knew I was going to be in the hospital for awhile. I am now reading my 3rd EBook that I borrowed from my local library.
1,"This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling."
1,This Kindle is alot larger and better for viewing.
1,"I really am enjoying the echo, it seems like I'm learning something new everyday, love to listen to my iheart radio stations on this"
1,I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
1,The tablet is great and has some great features. I love it!
0,The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
1,"I enjoy Echo as it does so many things. Plays music, provides news, weather reports and so many other skills. I can even check the status of my Amazon orders."
1,I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
0,To much programming especially for road and traffic congitions
1,Got this on sale and definitely a good purchase. Very useful for the whole family
1,Bought as a gift for a person's first tablet. They love it. Easy to use and as many popular apps as any other devices. Highly recommended.
1,"How have people lived with Alexa so long? I have had her from the beginning. Now I'm buying her as gifts. She now has capabilities to call and message, play jeopardy , keep shopping lists, play music, every week she gets smarter, and you get and email to hear about it. Can be an interactive device with other home gadgets too ie Nest and Lifx lights. So cost efficient go buy it today. All others are imitation"
1,It is cool.We are in the 21st Century. This the beginning of a whole era of AI technology.
0,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
1,"I have get to be disappointed by a tablet from Amazon. This Fire is amazing. For the price, the speed and quality of this can not be beaten. The features are endless and the screen is beautiful. This is so much more than an e-reader. If you are in the market for both a e-reader and a versatile tablet, you can not go wrong with this."
1,"I was hesitant to buy a Kindle Paperwhite as I already owned an entry level Kobo that was about 6 years old. However, I'm goad that I upgraded as this device is smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. Its a lot easier to hold for an extended period of time. Additionally, as part of the Kindle ecosystem, borrowing e-books from the library is a snap and no longer requires me to hook up to my computer."
1,Very good price for this tablet. It is a gift for my son.
1,This is an amazing electronic that help you get going during the day goes. I simply love it!!!
0,I tried this out for a few weeks and it does not have nearly the programs that it says it does. I would rather pay for Netflix or Hulu.
1,"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
1,Easy to use tablet good for the kids and around the house. Only issue is that sometimes it takes long to recharge.
1,Excellent Amazon fire HD for kids. Perfect for a holiday gift
0,We have an echo dot in my son's room and bought this for the kitchen. I'm not sure why this is so much more but has the same functionality. I wish we would have bought another dot instead!
1,This was for our grandson and he loves it!! He is able to do his school work on it. Parents monitor it closely so he is able to have 3 games on it. Very pleased with it. We also got a good case for it which is good protection for it.
1,My kids love them. Able to do so many things with it!
1,Bought for my mother-in-law she didn't want afraid of technology
1,Very very fast and has 4K awesome video that most players don't have!
1,My 11 year old daughter loves it!! This product surpassed expectations.
1,The Echo allows you to pipe music through any room in your house. And you can use it for an alarm clock or radio.
1,"As I age, it's difficult for me to see the smaller screens so when this one came out .... I was delighted!!! Love playing my games!!!"
1,A must have item.
1,Works great! Just wish it worked with Alexia. Way more features than Apple TV.
1,"I picked up the Amazon Echo a few months back. I'm mostly thrilled with it. Occasionally the Echo fails to execute a command like, ""Alexa, play 670 the Score on Tune-In."" It will reply, sometimes many times in a row, ""could not find 670 on Tune-In."" This morning it managed to find it after 5 consecutive errors. So there are some issues with connectivity, but I love the addition of the echo to my home, now it's time to upgrade lights and thermostats!"
1,Great product - Can see very clearly when reading in the dark or in the bright sunlight!
1,Super awesome all in one media device that will surely keep everyone in the family entertained.
0,"Too small for me. Page turning constantly due to size. Page refresh jumpy, irritating to my eyes."
1,Bought for my daughter on Christmas. She has hooked it up and and has enjoyed using it That's good enough for me. :)
0,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
1,This Kindle is awesome! Put off getting one for way too long. Light weight and cute. Fits in a purse or bag and you hardly know it is there. Reading is simple and easy. Downloading books is a breeze! Don't hesitate to get this Kindle. You will love it.
0,"The product would be great if it was easier to find the setting icon and if amazon wouldn't charge you a $1 for downloading applications that are labeled ""free."" The one dollar is automatically charged by amazon but you can dispute it with your Credit Company."
1,Amazon fire have the best window from all the others out there even apple tv
1,"I really enjoy my tablet for reading and my books. Meets all my needs which is online shopping, news and book reading!"
1,Like these tablets they were gifts. I bought it for someone in another country
1,I use Amazon for everyday purchases and am a member of Amazon Prime. This tablet is extremely fast and seems to me to be very well built. I am now thinking about retiring my Nook Color that I have been using for a very long time.
1,I bought 4 of these tablets for my 12 yr old Sunday School class to use during our lessons. They love them. The tablets are easy to use and a good size for that age group. Very much worth the price.
1,While comparing to other competitive products the Echo appeared to be the best. Purchased as a gift for a family memeber.
1,"This item was a replacement for a misplaced/lost Kindle Voyage. It is my go-to eReader, compact, light-weight, and read anywhere (bright sun, shade, at nite) device. The Kindle Paperwhite could have been equally useful, but I was spoiled with the Voyage. As a note, I also have an iPadMini and an iPad Air2, but they are much heavier to lug around."
1,This is so easy to use. An enjoying the many many unexpected things that can be done.
1,"I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas"
1,Easy to install and use. Easy set-up. Great for streaming entertainment. Definitely recommend.
1,"4stars bc the voice recognition needs improvement! Other than that, it's amazing! We use it for music, news, and my children use it for educational purposes, but my son figured out the music very quick! Only had it for about a week now, so I'm sure we'll figure out more as we go along!!!"
1,"Great tablet with an even better price. Very affordable, sleek and has camera."
1,"..who is an  fanboy, and now he will more than likely trash this when the HomePod arrives.. yay  .."
1,you couldnt really expect anything more from a device so cheap compared to other tablets
1,I had a kindle for several years that I thought was adequate until I purchased the paper white. What a difference with all of the added features this Kindle offers. I like the light with it's brightness feature most of all. The ease of use makes it a great e reader for everyone. I highly recommend the new PaperWhite.
1,"I love the Kindle paperwhite, but it does not accept any of my games."
1,"Works great sounds great! Bought this for a gift and was more than impressed. Stereo system is really good .,follows Alexa commands or"
1,"I never used to read books, until I got my kindle I have read over 10 books in a few months"
1,We got the Alexa on sale for $150 my wife enjoys putting music on whenever she wants I enjoy the information I can get
1,Very easy for a child to be able to use and enjoy.
1,My younger sibling loved this tablet I got for him he is always on it and can also read on it
1,Affordable price the tablet was a nice Christmas gift
1,Good device for a school age child convent use easy download
1,Bought his for the lady because she kept getting distracted when trying to read things on the iPad. Plus the lighting on the iPad is a bit harsh when reading at night. This was the perfect answer to both of those things.
1,"Alexa is a great enhancement to any home automation system. You need to do some research in order to find out all you can do with it, but this is part of the fun. I can only recommend this to any tech geek ..."
0,"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it"
1,This was a great product foe the money. Was able to download games for kids with no problems. Easy to access parental controls for myself..love it
1,"My younger grandson loves this, it goes wherever he goes!"
1,I love this. It is great. One of the best things I ever bought. It can do so much.
1,I purchased two of these for my grandchildren. They love them!
1,Cheap price but the specs are not cheap. A practical choice
1,The tablet was a great price i have recently brought expensive tablets but this one does the same job as the others
1,Streaming works great! Very fluent! Very fast processing power!
1,Nice little table for the price. So far it's working well for the family.
1,Good but a few quirks or issues that could use improvement. Connecting the remote should not make the speaker function unavailable because one Bluetooth connection at a time
1,"I bought 2 of these. My 4 and 8 year olds each have their own. For $50, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better product. We used the Amazon unlimited trial for a month, and have just been using free apps since. Good buy."
1,It is Great. I use it all the time easy to use great product
1,I got this tablet for a senior that is learning to to use a tablet and learning navigate through apps and the Internet and adjust to a reader
1,"I bought this tablet for my mom for christmas. It was on sale, but is already at an inexpensive price to begin with. She is extremely happy with my gift. She is able to read and play games on a tablet with great speed. I might even buy my own!"
1,We bought this for our grandaughter. She loves technology and this has all the basic things she needs or will use. Smaller size fits her hands well.
1,Purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren to play games on. Excellent tablet for the price!
1,"Since I don't like to read the news, I just ask Echo for my news update. And getting the weather for any day for any city and state is a snap!"
1,My wife loves this kindle big upgrade over her 3rd gen. Works just as well as a tablet as an ereader
0,It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it. So for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.
0,I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
1,Works fine with TWC RR Extreme. Better than a Smart Tv.
1,Can't live without it. Controls all the smart home gadgets in the house.
1,Tablet is very good. I have a lot of apps and pretty much do my homework there
1,Everything is ok with it. It is my first tablet but it seems adaquate.
1,Purchased two for my 9 year old girls. They love them and I love the fact that there are so many parental controls.
1,"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets."
1,"I really like my Tap very much. It great when it's connected. Reads me news, weather, plays music and can purchase items from Amazon That being said, I do have some connectivity problems while on wifi. I don't want to say that it's the taps fault as it may be my wifi. I don't regret my purchase. It has great sounds and recognizes my voice commands well."
0,"Bought these for my kids for the holidays. No you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. Ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for $15. Amazon states that since I purchased the tablet on sale for $15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. I would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.Maybe a good product, but not for us."
1,"I can't imagine a day without my Fire reader. I absolutely love it and it's so light and easy to carry with me, it is a big part of my day and night. It's so easy to use and download books, and magazines, and even movies. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.
1,It's a lovely game for kids wolf my daughter have one and I love it
1,Great stocking stuffer for the price and realibility.
1,"I love my new Amazon 7"" Tablet..I think its the perfect size and now I can do everything on it, from checking email to watching NETFLIX. Theres tons of apps to get and lots of kindle books to download. I did purchase a 32gb card after reading other reviews but I havent needed it so far ."
1,I can now watch all my favorite shows with Hulu and Netflix as well as all movies available with my Amazone Prime membership....
1,"The Fire 10 will do anything that the I Pad will do, and is at a much more attractive price."
1,Bought this for my child and has been exactly what was needed. A cheaper and possibly better option to the iPad.
1,im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!
1,"love t5o listen to my Echo, have to lear4n to talk to alexia so she can understand. grate for parties, just tell alexia what to play--and the party is on. no balky items to carry or to set up. just plug into a outlet, wait for the echo to warm up, after that, its ready to play."
1,Great to interact with a product by voice that can provide information as well as enjoyment
1,"Vraiment bon petit appareil , lger et facile d emploiJ ai hte de m en servir sur les plages cet hiverBelle bibliothque de livres disponiblesBon achat en bref"
1,like this to stream.. but would be nice to have kodi support without hacks
1,Echo is the best thing you could ever buy love it.
1,"I initially wanted to buy a kindle but couldn't pass up the great deal and thought I could exchange it if I changed my mind. It works great and has plenty of memory for what I needed, which was strictly to read. I liked that I could also watch Netflix on it. The only downside for me is that unlike the kindle I can't read it in the sun, but that's not that much of an inconvenience so far. Overall I've been very happy with it."
1,"I love reading books on my Kindle. I don't know why I waited so long to buy one. I also enjoy using it to check e-mail, Facebook, and Messenger,etc."
0,"I was unaware that it did not Have the Google Play Store or any formidable Stores to choose from! Amazon has to many App Stores it would seem. I get ""turned Around"" sorta Speak.... Due to the fact that i am unfamiliar with your Services. I am Learning Day to Day, I just Like to hit the Ground Running! But thank you for your time and Sharing these devices and making them readily Available to the General Public! Thank You, Johnny Young"
1,My son was very pleased when he saw the kindle fire. He loves it and it is great for him because he like to read his books online.
1,The amazon fire TV box is the same as the firestick but its a quadcore processor instead of a dualcore
1,"I was a little skeptical at first about the Amazon tap but after discovering how easy it was to set up, I was able to connect to my music library with ease! Great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me!"
1,Well worth the upgrade from the Amazon Fire stick... It is definately a lot faster and smoother.
1,I got this tablet for my niece because while she was visiting with me her tablet that she brought with her stopped working. I got online and searched for an inexpensive tablet that would do the same thing that her non working tablet would do and so I searched and ran upon this tablet and this is it plus more!!!!
1,The perfect Christmas gift. Now my family all has one.
1,"this item is pretty loud for it's size but the commands that you tell it have to be pretty specific. for example, when you tell her to play some music you have to be specific as to what station and that it's on pandora. not amazing but pretty cool"
1,"Excellent! New kindle fire tablet. This one better. Has camera, camcorder, and more organized"
1,"If you love to read this is a must. Only thing that I don't like is all the ads that pop up, when the wi-fi is open"
1,"Love IT!, Simple to use, very fast response as to my DVD with NetflixI recommend to have IT!"
1,"Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses."
0,Had trouble setting it up. Set it up using app on wife's phone. It doesn't work when wife's phone is out of the house. Grandkids have fun with it. Music speakers are good. I have a lot to learn about this thing.
1,This is easy to use and fun to download apps with. I spend many hours on my kindle fire 7 reading and playing games and going online.
1,I bought the Echo at a discount when combined with a Logitec Harmony remote. I now can operate my AV system just by telling Alexa what I want it to do. Pretty cool! I also use it to listen to Pandora and get my news at the beginning of the day. It is capable of much more but I am happy with what it does for now.
1,The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.
1,Very good tablet for the money. A lot fast than I thought it would be. Bought 2 for gifts.
1,"The echo is simple to use and easy to set up and the speaker sounds pretty solid. It can control most wireless products in your house. It works very well with lifx, WeMo, and Hue products. I even got it to turn off the TV thru Harmony."
1,"Ever since I bought this kindle for my 6 year old, he has not been able to get over it. He loves it and I do too, because I ""borrow"" it from time to time."
1,"Switched from AppleTV to Fire TV and absolutely love it. Speedy, lots of capabilities due to Android OS."
1,Great product use it every day to watch movies and tv shows
1,They work amazing and can't beat the price.........
1,There's a lot of features and we are just getting started with Tap. Glad we made the purchase!
1,Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!
1,Good product easy to use just to pricey but worth it.
1,everyone in the family can use it and find something they want to watch or do on this
1,"I was fortunate to order one of these as soon as it was announced. As an Amazon Prime member, I was able to buy the Fire TV Stick for 19 during a two day sale. I figured, for that price, I might as well test it out!Set up was easy and straight forward. I find that the interface is quick and easy to use. The interface and streaming on the Stick is much faster than the Amazon app built into my HDTV. This fact alone made this a great purchase. Here are some more thoughts I have on the Fire TV Stick so far: PROS:- Quick, easy to use, polished interface- Wireless streaming works really well- Amazon Instant video loads, fast forwards, and rewinds really fast- A dedicated Prime Menu allows Prime members to easily see what free content is available- Unlike Chromecast, the Fire TV Stick includes a remote- Can stream your own videos by first uploading them to your cloud disk- Can play quite a few casual games- Awesome, irresistible price for Amazon Prime users. I got it for 19 during the two day sale.- Better specs than Chromecast and Roku Stick- Ultraportable. I plan to use Fire TV Stick when I travel for work and to visit family- Stream local videos and other content using the Plex app http://www.amazon.com/Plex-Inc/dp/B004Y1WCDE/ (Thanks BikeRider!) CONS:- Included remote doesn't support voice search. That remote costs extra. Would be nice to have a second Fire TV Stick model that includes the voice search remote, rather can requiring us to buy a second remote.- Probably won't be able to use universal remotes with this unless Logitech offers a compatible device.- Not as fast as Fire TV, but since the Stick is so much cheaper, this is not really an issue.Read more"
1,It's great to be hands free..just ask alexa to add to shopping list or play specific music..nice sound .. no typing required ... Love it
1,"Pretty cool tech gadget to have around the house. Sync Pandora and play your favorite songs. Responds well to commands; can hear and recognizes her name from another room. She knows sports scores, weather, etc. but she can also be stumped. So far so good. ~"
1,Bought it for the kids to play with. I like it so far. Bought s few accessories to allow them to play with it
1,"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift."
1,It works like advertised. The only issue I have is it can hear you when you are listening to music on volume level 8 or higher.
1,Holding up well but purchased a good case. Like the kindle a lot.
1,Bought this for my husbands birthday. We both use it everyday for news weather and store lists. Awesome for playing music too. Highly recommend
1,I like this tablet it's easy to use Easy for the kids
1,This was a gift for my son he loves it great price point for an entry level tablet
1,Only those who have an Amazon account can work with this tablet
1,love it. works as expected. very helpful. best voice assistant out there
1,The Echo is a very cool device that is simple to use! Alexa is very responsive.
1,good speaker. 8 hour battery. Good price. Excellent quality in how it is made.
1,Purchased this for my wife as she is the reader in the family. Perfect is what she says. With Amazon prime even better with a selection of free books.
1,"We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied."
1,"I am enjoying my Kindle Fire. This is my third Kindle, but my first Kindle Fire. I really like the portability and the fact that in addition to books, the internet , checking my emails, I can also use it as a camera."
1,The product is easy to use and loads everything quickly. The voice command works great and the 4k picture looks fantastic
1,Very cool. NOTE: much cooler if you have amazon prime because you can stream music free. great gift
1,I really like it work great i recommended to my friends
1,"I love it ! I use it every day for music, movies, and current events. The voice command remote is awesome. Cant wait to buy the video game controller for it to play first Gen. Nintendo games"
1,I love how it has a built in light and the fact that's it compact. Very easy to use.
1,Perfect for night time reading and outdoor reading!
1,"Fun to ask random questions, get news and weather. I also control my Phillips hue lights with it. Kind of a novelty right now but I'm looking forward to some good use I can put it to."
1,Love my kindle paperwhite! Love the no glare and small enough to be held with one hand!!!
1,"The voice remote is awesome. Now I have ""Alexa"" on my TV as well. Good quality streaming content and it has everything you need: Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, etc..."
1,Excellent tablet!!! works very fast and esay to get apps
1,"I had the original Kindle Fire 8.9 inch and then upgraded to the Kindle Fire 10"". I purchased one of these as a gift for a couple of family members. I setup these tablets and I was surprised that for the price how fast it was and it has the same apps and pretty much functionality of my 10"". The screen resolution isn't as good as a higher priced tablet. But, for $49 it's great! Even if you have a tablet already this makes for a good one just to throw in the bag with you when your out and about. I use Kindle tablets primarily for media and entertainment purposes (Amazon Prime Movies, Netflix, Hulu, and the News stand)."
1,"This was an affordable device that allowed me to play music while at work. It also does quite a bit more, but this was my use of the product. It was less expensive than the iPod."
1,Bought this for someone as a gift and htey love it.
1,We bought 2 of these for our 2 oldest grandkids. They loved them and were excited to receive them and to use them on a trip to Florida.
1,"Wired internet connection is a little fast but still doesnt play higher resolution movies smoothly, especially 4k (i have 50mbps speed); could be due to slow server. For the price and infrequent use, i may just swap it for the cheaper firestick."
1,I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
1,Does everything we need. Light and portable. Bought 3 and no complaints.
1,Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
1,Loved my fire box so much I had to get 3! I'll def recommend
1,We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.
1,Works great love it! Bought for a gift. They really like it.
1,This provides better sound than the built in Samsung TV sound but not as good as a full surround sound system. I liked the fact it had a digital audio connection to the TV and it comes with the cable.
1,Loved my Kindle so much I bought one for my wife too. She loves the Kindle and find we both devote more time to reading!
1,I bought this tablet to watch my recorded TV shows while I am at quilt retreats. I also can watch Netflix and Amazon prime. I like that is takes a micro SD card!! Picture and sound are very good!
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it.
1,"I was looking for a reader that was just a reader. I did not want a tablet. The Paperwhite is the perfect choice for me. It is very easy to use and has a clear reading surface. It is a great size and I can read outside, inside and in the dark. I read the reviews and then went to Best Buy to see it. It was everything the reviews said. Some said there is a gray area at the bottom of the screen but I did not find that. I highly recommend it."
1,"This tablet is simple and easy to use. The only problem I've had is putting in a memory card. The tablet kept pushing it back out, had to read reviews online in order to input it properly."
1,I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.
1,"If you like digital music, this is for you! With all of the free music available from Amazon Prime, this is completely worth the price. The speaker is also impressive for its size. It has other cool features, but even if you only use it as a speaker with Amazon Prime, you will love it."
1,Fastest product I have ever used highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a lag free experience
0,"It is an ok tablet. As I am using it, I lose my page quite often and have to go back to find it again. Also, I lose internet connection or am unable to connect at all. For the money, I find it acceptable but not ideal."
1,Bought the Fire because I wanted to get Vue from Playstation which will not stream on Roku. First of all I do not like the Fire's layout. It is very cluttered and harder to find what you are looking for than on Roku. Also I had trouble with the streaming and extreme amounts of buffering while on WIFI. My modem was only a few feet away from the Fire. Roku almost never had buffering/streaming issues. I had to plug the Fire directly into the modem in order for it to work. This did take care of the buffering problems. I gave it a good for working when plugged into the modem. For WIFI only it would get a rating of POOR. I am very glad I did not get the Fire Stick because it probably would have had major buffering issues. If you are getting VUE and need the Fire I would recommend it. If you are not getting an app that needs to be on Fire than I would highly recommend the Roku. Roku is highly superior to the Fire.
1,Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
1,Simply the Fastest and Best tablet for the money and Best Buy was the easiest place to get it.
1,This tablet is so fast!!!! It has everything I want on it!
1,I bought these for a road trip for my teen daughters. The ability to download amazon prime content for viewing offline was the hook for me. Video quality is adjustable with the download and looks great on this screen. Battery life is adequate and a non-issue with so many charging possibilities in cars these days. All apps that I have wanted have been available for it too.
1,Like I said it's very gimmicky unless you plan on turning the house into full automation tilts just gimmicky
1,great handheld device for starters and easy to handle
1,Very fast awesome product...worth the money and i would definitely recommend.
1,I didnt know much about the amazon fire your staff did t.y. the girls love them
0,"Good tablet,the screen is a little confusing but OK"
1,"Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this!"
1,I really like the large echo by amazon. The speakers are clear. I bought mine at Best Buy. They will stand behind their merchandise.
1,"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson."
1,I bought it for my 6 year old nephew. It's user friendly and my nephew loves to have his own tablet finally
1,Absolutely adore my Echo. I am always skeptical when my husband brings home new fancy technology but Alexa has not disappointed. I love having my music in any room of the house and I am able to control the song and volume without having to touch the Echo. Makes my life soo much better.
1,"For little more money than the firestick, you will get lan hard connection as well as wireless and 4k compatibility. Also provides faster processor for load times."
1,I purchased this tablet for my ten year old twins. It's a great gift for this age they haven't put it down. No issues yet and easy to navigate through the apps.
1,Great to travel with . Overall it is user friendly.
1,"Love my amazon fire! Easy to hook up and use. Even better if you are an Amazon Prime member. Music, movies, Netflix, Hulu & many more."
1,"works as i expected... pretty fast and pretty good display as well. i can't complain at all at this price. yes, if you take a look at it side by side with galaxy ($200), this is not as good. But, as long as you use for surfing and quick things like music and games, works great."
1,Awesome and reasonable. This Fire TV box packs enough punch for your viewing with more than adequate content.That it will knock you out.And for a REA$ONABLE PRICE. That you can afford.
1,Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!!
1,"Intuitive to use for the built-in Amazon, Netflix, etc., etc., and allows for streaming directly from the computer, too."
1,Well almost no more cable. We still need the internet but with this fire tv we get to watch all our stuff using our amazon prime account and saved us a couple of hundred a month. Purchased with HD antenna so we still get all our local channels. Highly recommend. There are other things that can be done that can give you more options.
1,"I didn't take the time to read the reviews on this as I actually went to the store to buy a Fire stick. The salesman talked me into the Fire tv instead supposedly because of higher picture quality. I haven't noticed any differences. For an average user, maybe the stick is just fine and you save money."
1,"Nice. Processor power was never a problem with the original Fire TV, so for streaming purposes, the new chip mainly serves to support 4K Ultra HD playback. Provided you have a 4K TV with an HDCP 2.2-enabled HDMI port, along with a fast Internet connection (Amazon recommends 15Mbps), you can stream Ultra HD content from either Amazon Video or Netflix. The Fire TV even labels Ultra HD content from Amazon video on the home screen, so you can quickly jump in."
1,The kids love it and are always on it. Would recommend to anyone.
1,"Great tablet for kids, very affordable. Great introductory tablet for first time tablet users"
1,"As a travelling salesman, I spend a lot of time on planes, trains, and buses -meaning I have a lot of free time to read. It's really good quality as it has lasted me almost a year which is a new record for electronic devices for me. I would definitely recommend this because it's simple to use, it is lightweight, and durable."
1,Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
1,"Have only been using the Amazon TV for a few months now and so far have been very satisfied. Simple to use, it walks you through the setup and provides access to lots of apps and streaming video services."
1,You are streaming over the net so occasionally this will cause some inconvenience but all in all 98% of the time you can utilize this device just as if you had cable or satellite. Time to cut the cord and stopping paying these outlandish supped up prices.
1,My husband got this for Father's Day. He loves the ease of downloading his favorite music and books.
1,......................................................
0,my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
1,I loooooove this tablet as well as my 3 year old with all the kids apps make it way more fun and safe for kids to enjoy
1,"I bought these tablets for my grandchildren, ages 8 & 11, because they love playing games on mine when they come to visit me. Oh the smiles on their faces when they opened them up :)"
1,I was impressed with the voyage overall. I especially like the light sensor feature because it makes reading enjoyable in all settings.
1,The Firestick is awesome! Would highly recommend to anyone for their tv.
1,the type resolution is fantastic and the screen brightness auto adjust compensates perfectly for both dark rooms and full sunshine on the beach!
1,Good product to kids for playing games.sssssssssss
0,"If you just want to watch movies or shop, it does the job. Not enough memory to do much else. But for the price its great for kids."
1,Replaced my original kindle after if got dropped and screen no longer readable. Turned this new kindle on after charging it and all my books were already there. I didn't have to do anything!
1,"Bought this tablet for one of my kids for Christmas. Super easy to use, and solid parental controls so I can make sure they don't access anything they shouldn't or make purchases."
1,"The Amazon Echo can be used for so many different reasons such as to do list, shopping list, and creating a smart home. I LOVE IT!!!!"
1,The Amazon Echo is like having a robot in your home. She responds to almost everything and it only took about 1/2 hour to set up
1,"I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price"
1,Easy to use. Kid friendly. Plenty to watch. Great price.
1,"Very nice looking, but the setup could use some work."
1,Love the new Kindle. No problem getting used to the differences.
1,"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
1,I don't know what took me so long to purchase this item system offers everything that could want for my tv experience in one package.
1,I have had a paperwhite kindle before and I wore it out. I love the paperwhite so much I bought another one. its my 3rd kindle. loved them all. no better way then to read with the paperwhite and not bother your bed mate.
1,I got this tablet for my nephew and have downloaded a lot of educational apps from the Amazon store.
1,I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
1,This is great for someone who LOVES Amazon and has prime. The video playback is in HD and is spectacular
1,"Kindle parter white is perfect for reading in all sorts of lighting, and easy to use."
1,"works great , and its a lot faster then my smart tv to access programs"
1,"She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
1,"nice and compact. user friendly, works well in low light"
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. And they come in colors now.
1,This is a Very nice option to get to my favorite content. I used audio receiver for simple connection to TV and additional audio options. The push button voice interface works as well as my Echo. As a Prime member content is plentiful and broad enough for my entertainment.
1,"This is my second Kindle Fire, and this is a great improvement from my 1st generation version. With micro sd capabilities, I can download and store so much more. Paired with Amazon Prime and I'm never bored!"
0,"We are pretty unhappy with this purchase. Several of the most popular apps (Instagram, You Tube, etc.) are NOT compatible with this device. Now I know why the sale on this was so great. We can really only run the internet and Facebook on this device. Will be returning and getting a different tablet."
1,Have purchased one and found it amazing. I bought second one for my father who find it hilarious
0,"Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon. I may be showing my age and ignorance here, but I bet I have lots of company. I say KISS for usage, even if it means a more complicated install."
1,This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
1,"Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy"
1,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it."
1,Works great greatest of the year and I love it and it is the best thing ever I want to be the first half of the year before I go to sleep and wake
1,Love the product it does good for what my children need it to do.
1,This works just like I hoped it would. Ties in with my hue lights and works even better after installing IFTTT app to pairs other features and devices to it.
1,I love this item. Meets my needs. Worthy. I recommend it.
1,The Amazon TV box is much better than the stick due to the high quality of resolution that it gives you. You can now have all the apps you need and use thru the Amazon box.
1,Works great
1,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!"
1,Great product for all types of users. Great for reading or playing games.
1,"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
0,"When I first saw this product it was a must have for me. I researched this product for weeks and was happy with what I had read. After getting the product home I must say it was OVER RATED!. This product is not user friendly, only 1 user can register, Alexa does not have the answers to much. I returned it after 5 days. Very unsatisfied"
1,You can watch almost anything on this thing and the quality is amazing!
1,"It works very well out of the box. Most of the apps you want will be there. The remote works flawlessly and is blue tooth so you don't have to point it at the box. Amazon locks down android, so you are missing some apps, but all of your streaming apps will be here. Expanded memory is nice as well. Great beginner device."
1,Great mini tablet. Clear video. Excellent reading. Very easy to learn.
1,The Echo is fun and easy. No longer do you need to walk to the device or use a remote!
1,"I have been wanting a tablet for awhile and I finally decided to get the Amazon Fire tablet, I love it I can look at Pinterest and check email I love it!!"
1,"Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could ""play games on."" She's very happy with it!"
1,Having so much fun with Echo I bought 4 of them. One for each floor in my home. I have them connected to smart home and can control my home. I intercom between rooms and get calls from my kids on the echo. Getting better all the time.
1,I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues.
0,"Like most Androd devices, has slowed down considerably over time since purchase. Nice for video watching but browsing the Internet is slow at times. Apps take awhile to load good for the price"
1,THIS IS A GREAT NOT TO EXPENSIVE TABLET THAT WE LOVE!
1,Was given as a gift to someone who needed something simple. The price was great for what it can be used for!
1,"Lost my older Kindle touch so needed to purchase a new one. Much the same as the old-which is good, not a hard learning curve. This one however now has the light, which is great. Very light in weight also. Definitely recommend."
1,"Easy to use, great traveling Device. makes purchasing new books incredibly easy"
1,I bought this for my 2.5 year old autistic son. We have downloaded all kinds of sensory apps and learning apps. It's such a wonderful tablet to take on the go as well as for home use!
1,Bought this for my husband and it's wonderful!!!!!
1,excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
1,"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost."
1,This box puts Roku and any other app box to shame!
1,Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it!
1,This device is awesome if you already have a prime subscription. It allows you to have SIRI like functions and even order direct from amazon. Speaker doesn't sound bad either. I would recommend this item if you also have smart plugs to turn on and off small appliances or lights.
1,"You can't beat a tablet at this price! I bought it mostly for reading books on the go on the Kindle app, but I've also been using it for so much more. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy an extra device at a low price."
1,Excellent quality. Easy to set up. Works great. Definitely recommend.
1,I really enjoyed my purchase. The tablet is awesome and my son really stays glued to it. Battery power is awesome.
1,Got this as a gift for friend of mine they have been very happy with this can't believe how light it is and how well you can read the text. If you're up for him and don't want to be caring around an iPad or have battery life on the product while you're on location this is a must take with you product.
1,Alexa is able to pickup my voice from several rooms away. It's able to search for anything that I ask for - even reading the news. The only thing that wasn't completely smooth was the initial setup. I would recommend this product.
1,It was nice to have an extensive library at my fingertips.
1,Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.
1,I enjoy my fire tv I would definitely recommend it
1,"I love it best thing,I've bought in a long time,I didn't know I'd love it so much"
1,it was a good price and works well. I would recommend a case.
1,"It was really nice to be able to find this at retail, in a store. The one we had been using died while on a trip. It made getting a new one really easy. They even carried both a white as well as a black coloured model."
1,We love our Amazon Echo. The kids love asking Alexa to play songs and pairing this with a portable battery for the Echo is a perfect way to move Alexa around the house. Highly recommend getting this over the Dot
1,"easy to set up, still getting the hang of all the features and really enjoying this - far more than I even imagined. If you're into sports and are looking for schedules, scores, etc. this is great!"
1,We love our echo! Alexa is very useful. Especially for my mom. Can turn the lights o and off while not moving!
1,"This is a very good tablet considering the price. While it is locked down a bit through Amazon, it was primarily purchased for a senior citizen. I felt Much better buying this rather than other similarly priced tablets."
1,"This Kindle Paperwhite is great. it stores plenty of books and has a screen that is easy to read. It is even easy to read outside in the sunlight. I also like how compact, light and easy it is to travel with."
1,Got this tablet for my 7yr old for Christmas and she loves it. It very simple to use for children and I love playing on it too.
1,Perfect for our family. Everyone can use it! We use it everyday!
1,"I got it just for my son and he can get on and play games and watch videos no problem, the parental controls are amazing and keep him in his specific apps"
1,"I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod"
1,"I bought this for my 7 yr. old, for reading, games, and netflix. The only minor annoyance are the ads. Its a little difficult for young new users at first, but she will figure it out! Overall a great purchase!!"
1,I bought two and gave them as gifts to a couple new to tablets. They love the FIRE tablet. now I think I am going to get one to play my games on. I currently have the iPad air.
1,The echo is good at playing music and getting the weather. I've not tried it with other smart home devices. It would be great if it were more intuitive. I found each app requires a specific command. Problem is trying to remember the app and allowable voice commands. Glad to see more abilities being added constantly.
1,"Had the fire tv stick for awhile and decided to give that to my parents and get this for me and my wife. Both of us were blown away by the difference between the two. So much faster loading everything. Amazed at how when you choose a video to watch and hit play, its there. instantly. Amazing."
1,"This tablet has a lot of features, it really makes it worth the money if you have an Amazon Prime account."
1,Great buy for the price. We currently own 4 of them. Buying my grandson one for Christmas too.
1,The Echo was on sale for $99 (marked down from $179) so I decided to buy it. I have the Google My Home but Alexa is better. It has 18000 words in its vocabulary.
1,"This is a full featured tablet at a remarkable price. I have used this tablet on a daily basis and not been disappointed. The only shortcoming I have found is that tablet cases cannot put the tablet to sleep or wake it when the cover is closed or opened. Given the price, however, I really have no problem with that omission."
0,"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it"
1,"I like being able to ask a question without having to pull out my phone, tablet or computer. and also listening to music."
1,My kids have gone through several Amazon Tablets and this one is by-far the best one I have seen.
1,So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life.
1,Lot of fun to use. Linked lights and temosta to to echo. Works great.
1,It's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. It's still going strong for 2 months now
1,If your looking for an upgrade from Roku or the fire stick this is it
1,its the best device i could have gotten for the amount of money spent!
1,Got this tablet for my 5 year old works great even use it myself sometimes good for movies as well the only thing I don't like is too many adds on it can't take off unless you pay amazon for it
1,"Capacity limit is my only gripe. Connects quickly and easily to wifi and remembers wifi passwords until you erase them. Books, many are free, especially the ones that you never read in High school. Check email, even works with Bluetooth keyboard. Cant be beat at the price."
1,Got it on sale for $40 for techo-illiterate dad and he likes it so far. Better screen quality than I expected.
1,Got this tablet for my dad for Christmas and actually liked it. Didn't know if it would operate at a decent speed with the low ram but it was sufficient for what he used it for.
1,No problems the unit work as Apple has explained with little or no effort
1,I have bought 2 of these for my grandchildren. They live them!!
1,I love the how clear and fast streaming . Would highly recommend this item for steaming etc
1,The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
1,It's a great tablet the price was excellent best buy in boardman ohio
1,"Alexa speaks clearly and gives comprehensive answers to questions asked of it. Having weather, sports and news on voice demand without having to type a request is terrific."
1,"Thrilled with the ease of use, so easy to navigate! I wish I had started with a tablet like this, it would have saved me a lot of frustration."
1,This product is great for children. Easy to use and very inexpensive. Allows for enough storage and very durable!
1,"Everything is working great, it's a great source of info. Setting up the voice activation for my smart home at little challenging but making good progress. Would pick this over the Google Home anyday."
1,is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks
1,this great for catching up on facebook or going over email
1,"But, this isn't a bad substitute. The print and light are easily adjustable. It's small and lightweight, easy to carry and holds a charge for a week or so. At the font size I use it takes 2 to 3 kindle page turns to equal 1 page turn of a book and thus I think I would prefer a larger screen. Although it's touted as better for the eyes than reading using the kindle app on a tablet, I really don't think that is the case for me. For me a tablet is just as usable although heavier and less convenient. Overall , for the price, the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend it."
1,Great product and I would recommend this product for everyone
1,"It is so nice to have all these streaming services in one box, and the voice command feature works great! Smooth UI with no lag, especially compared to it's little brother, the Fire Stick. My only complaint is that there is no 4K Resolution support."
1,I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
1,The price was right for what I needed and it dose what I need it to do.
1,"Easy to use, great screen resolution, and very simple to download material to read."
1,"Great value for surfing the net, reading, e-mails etc"
1,My wife bought this for my 6 year old son after his Nabi-Tab went south. Overall has been a solid purchase
1,I really like this product and have recommended it to others. Great buy for the price.
1,I mostly utilize this for music and light controls...who doesn't want to feel like their in Star Trek TNG?
1,This thing is better then the built in apps of my Samsung 4k tv. Its fast and awesome.
1,I bought for my father and its perfect for him. He loves being able to set reminders and play music he wants.
1,Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it.
1,This is the best streaming device to watch movies on or even Netflix.
1,I love this product i have several flat screen tvs and i have bought several of these fire sticks as i unlock the stick to put kodi on it so i can watch all the latest and greatest shows for free including im movie theaters and live tv i would hogjly recommend this product especially if u know how to unlock the stick ;)
1,"Works great if you plan to have it in arms reach. You have to physically tap it to ask Alexa. Store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap, not voice activate. Returned to wait for indefinite out-of-stock Echo to get in eventually."
0,Good tablet but it does not include google play like i was told it does by an associate in your store
1,Very good voice activated music player. I anticipate and look forward to the integration with Sonos equipment and my music collection.
1,If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!.
1,"I have more fun with this thing I'm much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news, because Alexia is constantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go. There's no pairing required, so I simply call out her name and she responds. There is always a battle between me and my teenager, trying to outshout Alexa instructions, so we can hear the music that we like best!"
1,Awesome tablet. Performance great. Perfect buy!!!!
1,"LOVE MY ALEXA!...BEST PURCHASE THIS YEAR, THANKS TO BEST BUY!"
1,Really love this device. Has all the bells and whistles. 4K view is awesome
1,I got this to replace an old Kindle that had no light. Works great and the price can't be beat!
1,I bought this item for my 9 year old son. He loves it and it has nice feaures such as parental controls.
1,"Every household should have one of these! It is great for music...does so much more. I am in process of making my home ""smart"" and it works lots of the smart home devices (all that I have purchased so far!) Must have in any family!"
1,Can't say how much my wife loves the Echo. She is constantly talking to Alexa and playing music while doing housework. Great decision to buy!
1,Does the job perfectly.Thanks.
1,Makes.an old TV new again. Wonderful if you are a prime member.
1,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
1,I bought this after already having a fire stick and this outperforms it.
0,"Nice built tablet. You need to note that it has Amazon Store, and no Google Play Store."
1,"I always feel like, somebody's watching me!!!!! And now with my echo, I'm positive big brother is."
1,We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
1,The best gift for my 2 years old nieceGreat tablet
1,So much fun to be had with this device! I sound like a dork everyday when I talk to Alexa. Love it!
1,Set up was easy and quick. Easy to learn how to use. It seems to be learning new things.
1,"Love my Kindle Paperwhite. Very easy on your eyes when reading, even in low light."
1,I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
1,This product does great for the kids. We haven't had and problems with it.
1,Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.
1,Faster than my firestick in navagating around and doesn't freeze as much.
1,We have had no problems since we purchased our Alexa. I have it hooked up to our Honeywell Thermostat and our Wemo light switch in the kitchen< and we have had no problems operating our devices. The kids love Alexa for playing their music.
0,Buyer beware They say it's free tv...ITS NOT!You have to pay for everything! I wish I would have bought this before I cancelled my cable.
1,"To be honest, I rolled my eyes about first getting a device like this but I was wrong, I love it!The sound of the speaker for playing music was far better then expected.Getting weather, asking about store hours, setting timers, having it tell a joke, news updates, playing music or streaming radio stations this has turned out to be REALLY handy!!Bonus, you can rename Alexa to Computer, so now I can feel like I'm on the Enterprise asking question...lol"
1,It is just amazing what Alexa can do. What great entertainment for people of all ages!
1,Great product purchased for my elderly parents. Very user friendly and inexpensive!
1,"My paperwhite died, so I went with the voyage, and I'm loving it. It's basically the same as the paperwhite, with the addition of sensors on the side to turn the page if you don't want to swipe the screen. And of course faster processor, etc."
1,"I purchased on Amazon Echo, set it up, and used it and absolutely love it! I have automated my Philips Hue lights, ecobee3 thermostats, television, and garage doors with it. I loved it so much, that I purchased a second for my upstairs, and purchased one for my brother for Christmas. He loves it as well. I use it for my alarm clock, cooking timer, weather notifications, and news. There are so many things to do with this device, that the list is too long to write. I hope they update the application so you can use multiple Echos as intercoms throughout the house."
1,"The Echo is everything I thought it would be. Easy to set up, easy to use, loud, and many extra features you can link with. The timer and grocery list features are awesome. Voice commands for Pandora are cool as well."
1,"Tired of by buying iPad's because there's just not enough memory? Look no further! Basically the same apps in the App Store can be found here, but even better - expandable memory storage!"
1,My GF really likes this. She watches Netflix and other programs on it all the time.
1,"this is a fantastic item, love the simplicity of its use"
1,I like buying things that work as advertised. This does.Although it does not respond as well to my wife's commands. Hmmm...
1,The screen is easy on the eyes. The light is always just right. Small enough to carry in a pocket or purse. Never run out of something to read.
1,"I bought three of these tablets. One for each of my boys. They are 5, 6, and seven years old and I have to tell Them to put these down. They would play with them all day if they could"
1,Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
1,My kids had neither one had a reader or a tablet before. This has been a good choice for them.
1,Bought this for wife but it has turned out to be a lot of fun for the household with all the features.
1,This thing is great! Keeps me up to date on local news!
1,I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.
1,Even better price. The paperwhite is awesome! Buy it!
1,"I bought this one as a gift. I already have one. I love it for music and news around the house. I send messages to family members on it. Best Buy did a great job getting it to me, and I caught it on sale. Couldn't beat the price."
1,This is a great device for someone who likes to check emails quickly and good size to hold while reading and to carry with you if you like to read while on the go.
1,Very light weight and easy to read in different lighting conditions. Does not strain my eyes like the kindle fire if reading at night. I do wish Bestbuy carried more options for cases to fit the Voyage. They have none in the store at all.
1,"We love having the Amazon Echo as it is lots of fun. You can set timers, reminders, find out the weather and lots of fun stuff. I believe if hooked up to the correct apps, you can even ask it to play specific songs. We really love it!"
0,"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
1,"My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops."
1,My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price.
1,We have a first generation Kindle that stopped taking a charge so I decided to get one of the newer cheaper models at my local store. He loves it and it plays more games now that it's got a faster processor.
1,The size and weight is perfect. Easy to use and long battery life.
1,"I got the echo on Black Friday 2016 and couldn't be happier. She doesn't understand some things but she's useful with what she does know. I use mine via Bluetooth on my iPhone and have her take the controls. I like listening to podcasts on my echo as well. And when I wake up, she's ready to tell me the weather and any news updates. Would recommend to anyone looking into a smart device like the echo!"
1,Amazon Echo is an amazing product. Great sound!!!!
1,This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.
0,"I was hoping for a 'google' experience, but it isn't there yet. There is a lot of questions that it can't answer. I hope, and expect it to get better. The music player is a nice feature that I use frequently."
1,Awesome product!! I buy them regularly!!! If looking for a good device buy this one
1,My boys absolutely love Being able to do ABC mouse on here and I Feel this was one of my greatest purchases
1,Amazon added ads to this less expensive tablet. Annoying
1,"I had intended on replacing my dying 7"" tablet with a larger size, but I hesitated due to the added bulk when traveling. I'm glad I waited and grabbed this one for only $34.99. I'm very happy with the clarity of the display and the few free items I've downloaded from Amazon. Earphones are a necessity for music videos/movies of course. The only thing I don't care for is the charger plug which inserts into the tablet. Time will tell if this is a weak point."
1,The Best Android Based Set-Top Box For it's Price.Amazon outdid themselves here with their Fire TV line. They got it right and they do not appear to be abandoning this anytime soon so hop on now while it's still hot.
1,"I love my Alexa! She plays music when I ask her, she answers questions when I ask, and she turns my lights on and off. 5 stars!!"
1,"awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies"
1,Great product and works as described - easy to learn
1,"I love what my echo can do, I get my news, weather and traffic from Alexa each morning."
1,Bought this as a gift for someone but I haven't heard of any issues
1,This is an item that I bought as a gift. My daughter loves it as well as her entire family.
1,I am enjoying my Amazon Firestick TV. The best investment I've made.
1,"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
1,"Easy to install, nice alternative to cable great shows on demand."
1,I gave it to my mom for a gift. She loved it lot..
1,"Works great, the talking assistant is a great novelty although I personally don't use it that much. HD clarity is fantastic on a 4K TV. Highly recommended if not using on a smart tv, which can already connect to Amazon by itself. Although the HD is actually better through the external device"
1,"I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)"
1,This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don't want to spend more on tablets.
1,I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law. He loves gadgets so I knew he would appreciate the Echo. I had received this as a gift last Christmas and absolutely love it.
1,"Easy setup. Fun to use. Very helpful. I bought this for my in laws and they love be it! Alexa helps keep up with doctors appt, grocery lists and other important things!"
1,"Purchased 2 of these to gift to my granddaughters, and they absolutely love them. It's just the right size for them to comfortable hold."
1,Bought this for my mom as a gift and she loves it. Much easier than buying paper books
0,"I purchased this for our goddaughter and while the price is amazing, and the tablet is acceptable for low overhead use, I set up the same tablet for my daughter and it is too slow for my use."
1,It's good but not greatDoes everything form movies to tv and apps and gamesAlso there are plenty of mods out there for more features
1,Super light and love the color. Very easy too carry around :)
1,This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven't used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice.
1,"Absolutely love my Voyager! It is much lighter than the original Kindle and smaller also. Fits better in my purse, so I now carry it everywhere I go. A little harder to navigate to my library, but am learning."
1,"It's fast and pictures are very clear,love it glad I bought it."
1,"Alexa is smart, funny and easy to use. I'm usually technologically challenged but Alexa is very patient with me!"
1,"It is small,lightweight and fits easily into a backpack"
1,"I never thought I'd like an e-reader. I'm kind of a dinosaur... I like real books... the feel.... the smell.... ah! But, alas, I travel a lot and I read even more. At my age lugging around a bunch of books in my carry-on was becoming less enjoyable. So, after my last journey I decided to try a Kindle.Well, I must say I'm not going back to paper! It downloads titles in seconds, holds a mini-library, and fits easily in my purse. I'm still on my first charge. The light in the display makes reading in low (or no) light possible. The screen prevents glare. And, the controls are easy enough for a techno-phobe such as myself. Fantastic!"
0,"Bought this device to stream Netflix, Amazon Prime, and to play downloaded content. For that purpose it is sufficient. I wouldn't use a Fire Tablet as a productivity device as it is seriously underpowered. Fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when I attempted to multi-task. Bottomline, this is not an iPad replacement - particularly if you like to do a variety of things on your tablet. But at $33 on sale, this was a very good deal for my purposes."
1,This product is very light and convenient. i often use it in the evening.
1,Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that
1,"We had a streaming movie box that had Kodi pre-loaded. Even though the box was capable of speeds up to 100 mbps, it seemed to always buffer or just stop. We bought the Amazon fire because it supports up to 200 mbps and supports 4k as well. I rarely have any issues now. Also the number of apps this will run is great."
1,Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyShock proof and great educational apps for kids in it
1,I fabulous way to incorporate smart tv technology into a well performing pre smart tv. Great functions and great sound. Blows away Apple TV!!
1,Bought for my nephew. He didn't know how to operate it. It is a little tricky. Would not recommend for a child
1,nice tablet for the price able to browse internet with ease
1,"I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn't think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn't need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too!"
1,"I have enjoyed a Kindle Reader for years. If you think your phone works just as well, you probably have never tried a Kindle Reader. When my last one began to fade, I hit the reviews and then bought this one. I would rather pay a bit more and have all the features that I want, than go for the best value for money to save a few bucks and have buyer's regret. In this case they are both the same."
1,Works great! Just the right size. Would recommend to family and friends.
1,"My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection."
1,"Every morning I ask what the weather is, and she tells me. Fantastic. She also does a lot more."
1,"Great tablet, kids love it and have their own. Easy to use"
1,Good tablet if you are looking for one thet doesn't cost alot. Amazon has a nice app market as well
1,The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.
0,"You get what you pay for with this kindle fire. Excellent as a Kindle for reading books, but not great for using the Internet. I am used to using another tablet which is much quicker and I was frustrated using the Kindle... It doesn't measure up to other tablets. Still worth the $ for a decent reading device."
1,"Great for web surfing. Easy to learn, easy to master."
1,my kids like them so much i buy 3 of them and i got a real good deal on them
1,"I have tried Roku and Chromecast and was not happy with either. Now have the Fire TV and I'm so pleased with how intuitive and clever it is. Plus, the darn little thing is rock solid... I've not had any glitches with it since the purchase and it is on all the time."
1,Device serves my intended purpose very well. Clear screen and easy maneuvering.
1,"This tablet is awesome for the price point! Read, play games, consume media, surf the Web... and all for around 50 bucks! It's easy to set up and easy to use. Nice cameras and expandable memory round out the package."
1,"Got this for the wife and she loves it, easy to switch users also!"
1,This tablet is better than any other tablet of the same cost range. My son saved up to buy his own tablet and had similar priced tablets break or have software issues. This tablet has a nice quality screen and it is nice to be able to not be forced to do everything through Amazon despite it being an Amazon tablet. The option of a Best Buy replacement plan is handy when getting the tablet for kids.
1,FOR ITS SIZE IF OK THE VALUE MY WIFE LOVE IT SHE USE IT ALL THE TIME
1,"Enjoying watching movies, playing games and surfing the web"
1,nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
1,I took advantage of the $89 for one and bought 2 of them! Really like amazon music and Alexa!!!
1,"We ABSOLUTLY love the echo. The sound quality is great and it hears me when I'm coming up the stairs. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to listen to music, control lights, our order from Amazon"
1,This product is amazing -- plays music-- gives definitions--spells-- answers questions on any subject--weather reports--news reports etc. etc. etc.
1,"I use this not just for amazon prime, but I love the convenience of adding other apps like Netflix and sling. No need for a dish outside the house to enjoy tv"
1,This is a great item!!! You can ask her basically anything and she will let you know the answer. Even How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
1,Bought two for my 3 and 6 year old for Christmas and they enjoy them so much. Ease of use and even my 3 year old can navigate this tablet.
1,"We love our Kindle Fires! One for me, spouse, & 87 year old mother. It keeps us connected just as any more expensive tablet can, and for 1/4 of the cost. Also has Amazon special apps."
1,I was looking for a good small tablet at a reasonable price and I found the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet had all the features I needed. Easy and fun to use!
1,Great for daily use no matter where you are. Huge fan of this product!!
1,"I bought this strictly for the streaming 4K content from Netflix. Not sure if this happened to others, but season 2 of HOC would never stream correctly in 4K. The other seasons worked just fine. Also, HOC looks very very good just on HD 5.1."
1,Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot.
1,Fun to have and the kids can get all kinds of info from Alexa.
1,Bought this as a gift for my mom's birthday. She really enjoys it.
1,"This is my fourth one. I have one at work, one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. This one was for my wife's work - she loves it. Good sound and amazing features."
1,It works great with our smart home and simplifies a lot of tasks for us.
1,Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
1,"This fire box is the best you can get for a cheap price. It runs surprising well and so far have had no issues with wifi streaming Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Netflix. Definitely even worth more if you have Prime for the streaming from Amazon. Only minor problem is restrictions on most add-on apps due to going through Amazon and not Google Play but there are various work arounds."
0,"A decent machine for the Black Friday price of under $40. The 8 GB of memory is inadequate if you play games using the Apps. I added a 32 GB micro SD card, but not all the Apps use it and the ones that do, only transfer part of the application to it. All points, coins, etc earned are retained in internal memory, not SD card. Pictures, videos, music can be stored on SD card. Screen is very sharp."
1,This tablet is easy to use and great for a beginner. Plus you can find the Kindle on sale at an affordable price.
1,Extremely easy to view. No light needed. Just what I was looking for.
1,What a cool product and very easy to set up. We've used it a LOT so far and haven't even scratched the surface of everything it can do. Highly recommend!!
1,Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids
1,Pretty easy to use once we went thru it with our grandkids. We are not technically savvy.
1,Great product just couldn't get my international chanels
1,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! Has so many apps I can download that he loves.
1,Kids love it to death! Games and tv also learning its wonderful
1,"Works great, provides you information about all of the things related to amazon more promptly. Drawbacks are cannot ask a follow up question, echo doesn't hear you properly when you are playing with more than average volume. There are lot many skills, I hope wait of 6 more months will be worth enough."
1,I like it because it's like using a firestick but you're able to hook it up through the Ethernet cable so you don't have to worry about lag.
1,"best streaming device , very portable , amazing picture"
1,A gift to my 2 year old granddaughter. It came preloaded with child programs. She quickly learned how to access the programs. Parents now have their iPad back...very well protected for tosses and drops
1,Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
1,This tablet is great for kids. I bought it for my Grandson and he is delighted with it. He uses it constantly.
1,Bought as a gift for my mother in law for her birthday
1,Perfect for the kids to use and I loved the price.
1,Really enjoys it and all the different options you can use it for!
1,Absolutely worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Love Alexa. So much fun to ask questions and get information.
1,"Works great, nice picture, pretty fast; only downfall is that you can't access the Google Play Store, which I needed due to some specific apps. That's the only reason for 4, not 5 stars. I will still keep it though. Great for the price"
1,If you want an eReader for just reading books then this is for you.
1,The Amazon Fire is a great intro tablet. I got this for one of my youngest child so I could setup time locks for usage and other parental controls. If you want to use Googles Playstore on the device then you have to hack it on there as it is not available in current builds.
1,Needs to be a way to lock screen. Kiddo loves the device for books and movies on long road trips but accidentally turns off screen or clicks out of it.
1,nice to have to watch netflexs on in bed and relax.
1,The fire meets my needs for my reading enjoyment. It is less cumbersome than always carrying around a book. I have no problems whether in daylight or at night. I would highly recommend this product.
1,Works great in my entertainment setup. My only real complaint is that you can't control it directly using an Echo - currently using a Harmony Hub.
1,"Purchased this as a christmas gift for nephew, he loves his tablet. His mom loves it even more now that he can play some games on it. Tablet is not too heavy, just put a protective case to protect your investment."
1,Works great for all your online streaming needs ..
0,This product is a beginner product for Kids and nothing to be of use for Elders
1,"The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
1,The echo is a nice product and many options are with it
1,Purchased this for my son for organization purposes which ended up becoming the family personal assistant. Love the apps and the capabilities this nifty gadget has.
0,"I would like to rate this 3 and half stars - while the adapter itself works just fine, I think it is underhanded of Amazon to make you pay extra for it. Maybe I am not technologically up-to-date, but it seems to me that most people charge things at a wall socket not with a computer USB port. I think that I read that charging with USB takes longer as well. Just like an airline charging you for taking your bags on the plane, now Amazon is charging you for things you need to make the Kindle work - pretty soon you'll have to pay for the cord, guides and updates. Not very good customer service :("
1,The device has friendly operation interface. The resolution is high.The battery also lasts pretty long. It is a good one. I like it.
1,"Simple to use, best for kids cheap gift for distant relatives and first time users"
1,Bought this as a gift for someone and they love it! so many commands and uses for this device
1,I bought this before I went on vacation to Florida and it was great for reading in the sun!
1,Im having a lot of fun with my echo and learning a lot of skills.
1,My husband really likes this product and uses Alexa a lot
1,It's show everything in great view of videos and..
1,"Perfect for our young daughter, its a perfect size and she can use it very easily."
1,Love the streaming capabilities on this item. Really saves a lot with the increasing cost of cable.
0,"Bought this for my mom. The touchscreen is not as responsive as my iPad. The camera is a little underpowered too. I didn't think it would matter much, but it is pretty pixelated. It serves her purposes and I knew it wasn't a high end device going in. She has been able to fumigate it out mostly, so that's been a bonus."
1,woks fine
0,They make a great child proof cover and the battery life is descent so far
1,"I purchased these for my 6 and 4 year old daughters. They love them. The memory is quite low, as they have to delete apps when it gets full. But overall good value"
1,"I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I'm reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don't know what I'd without this gem."
1,Great battery life and read. I especially like its weight and how easy it is on the eye.
1,Does everything I need it to and with great quality too! Couldn't have asked for a better product.
1,Great tablet. Lots of features. Good memory and quick response when connected to wifi.
1,Works great No issues Awsome productGoing to buy another one
1,Best Value I've experienced in years. Great Quality for small cost.
1,"I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more."
1,Purchased four of these for xmas gifts and they❤It
1,It's good for what I paid for it $35 now it's $50 yes
1,"This is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite, not sure is worth the premium though. While faster than paperwhite it is still way less responsive than an iPad, it is very hard to type on it (when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance).I like the navigation areas on the edge of the screen but I'm not crazy about them. I'm not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that comfortable while reading in bed. I guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely.I previously had a Paperwhite which got lost and I thought I'd better buy the latest kindle now.When I bought the paperwhite it has been an experiment, as I'm not an avid reader and I have a hard time reading paper book since I got surrounded by gadgets. I actually read few books on the paperwhite and I enjoyed it. So when I lost it (misplaced it) I was longing for it as I had few books I wanted to read.If this would be priced at least $50 cheaper I think it would be a 5 star proposition. Like it is now, it is a tad too expensive for the scope and the shortcomings. Closer to $100 it would be a sweet price.Prefered buying at BestBuy over Amazon as the loyalty programs are better (vs nonexistent) and I also used a movers coupon."
1,"This tablet is not going to be a flagship tablet. Considering you're paying about 10% of the price of an iPad, this does more than 10% of what an iPad can do. Netflix, browsing, emails all work great! Can't complain."
1,"We purchased this on the recommendation of our son and daughter-in-law. It was extremely easy to set up and we use it every day. We love the capability of being able to create a shopping list by talking to Echo and then being able to use that list in the store, even without internet access."
1,extremely inexpensive! Was shocked at the price. I thought there must be a catch like I have to buy a membership for it to work. I was wrong. Downloaded 40 apps the 1st day and started using it right away. Its perfect for my 5 year old son to play with. Durable and won't scratch.
1,I love it ! Tons of options and endless entertainment
1,Good price for use. Perfect size for kids. Battery last a long time.
1,Very easy to use. It's small enough to fit in my purse so I can always have a book to read with me.
1,Great product to watch shows online. Only downside is that you can't stream/cast computer screens easily like a chrome cast can. Being able to talk into the app or remote makes it really easy to navigate the system to find things fast
1,One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely!
1,"The Paperwhite is great for reading indoors, outdoors and at night. No glare and back light adjustment makes it awesome. Get one!"
0,the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great
1,If your connected to amazon the tablet is great to use.
1,I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use.
1,I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can't beat it. I use more then computer.
1,This is the most incredible tablet for the price. I recommend to anyone who wants a dependable tablet and doesn't want to spend a fortune.
1,I previously own a kindle paperwhite version one then upgraded to kindle voyage.big difference. Worth the price!
1,Bought this for my 10 year old son just so he can have some sort of electronic. Great for what he needs.
1,I love the Amazon Kindle Fire. Great buy! I use mine all the time
1,"We bought this for our bedroom and love that we can finally stream movies and tv shows while relaxing in bed. Plus I can shop on my tv from my bed, I love it!!"
1,"Search menus are far more user friendly and we haven't experienced any lockups, which happened frequently with the ROKU devices."
0,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
0,"The idea is right but after few weeks, needs restarting else it doesn't respond properly. Compatible devices pairs properly. I used lifx bulbs but it couldn't control them with voice says no device found. Hopefully they will release a software update soon."
0,Didn't know you had to buy space and many other things for this item to work.
1,Way better than the Amazon stick. No buffering love it
1,"Yes, it does what I need and does it pretty well. I like the extra storage capacity, because I use it to store photos, a portable portfolio. I like the size, smaller and easier to carry than a tablet device. It is my second one. I use both units, the older one just does not have the storage capacity."
1,This is very durable for a young child. It is very easy to use even for my 2 yo granddaughter.
1,well it was what i expected easy to download books ............... good price
1,"Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase."
1,"Love it, great for intertainment and I would recommend"
1,"I am on my second kindle fire and recently purchased this one for my husband. It's easy to navigate, great for reading books and as long as you have WiFi you are connected. I like that you don't have to buy a data connection to use it."
1,I have had an Amazon Echo since it came out and i Love it. I recently purchased a Google home and found at this moment it is not as good as the Amazon echo I'm sure the Google home Will get better over time but right now Alexa is the best. The sound that comes out of the Amazon Echo is better then the Google home plus you can connect Bluetooth to the echo but not the Google home. This black Friday (2016) I purchased another Echo and a few Echo Dots (Dots are a great price) and i could't be more happy.
1,"Bought to replace a work issued IPad. Some differences I've noticed:+survives repeated drops off the loft to the floor, unlike ipad+small, lightweight, fits in my small purse or daybag+cheap price means I'm willing to travel with it, take it anywhere, leave it at work unlocked- I don;t worry about theft like with apple devices-more limited apps available than ipad, but most major apps are there (but not my favorite list making app)-silk browser forgets that tabs were closed and always reopens to whatever page you've been browsing lately (but might make for a good accidental parental watch/ control to see what the kids surfed last)-standby battery lasts several days, active use all day, but not like my ipad, where I could leave it on standby for weeks, shorter standby battery life for the FireI use mostly for web browsing, social media, and Kindle books. no other cons noted."
1,"Works well and even better with amnazon music. You can choose an artist and it will shuffle through the songs on Amazon music. It links with Apple so you can have a music library. Sometimes it doesn't always hear you but works well with a personal library, Amazon music, iheart radio, siriusXM, and the premium version of spotify."
1,I lurve reading. Just lurve it. And I lurve my kindle.
1,Alexa is neat and once mastered many possibilities are opened.
1,I simply like so much that i do recommend it to all
1,Great product and integrates well with the Amazon suite of products. Closing in on Apple Ipad
1,"The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work)."
1,My granddaughter loves her Kindle Fire tablet. Easy to use and am purchasing one for my husband.
1,It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.
1,Works great for charging my Kindle.
1,"Simple to set up, worth the expense, fully compatible and works fairly well with xfinity comcast."
1,I think this model is better than the latest voyage model...
1,"Love it ! I started with a kindle,then a fire kindle, and now a fire tablet. I can do everything from reading, listening to music, watching movies to surfing the internet. Well worth the money."
0,"Not sure what will happen if it gets dropped, Doesn't appear to adequately cover the screen, Looks really good!"
1,I bought this for my husband for Father's Day and he absolutely loves it
1,This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games.
1,This is the best alternative to cable. Very easy to use!
1,It was an affordable gift for my son and he enjoys it and finds it helps him in school.
1,"One of the cheapest tablets anyone can buy. I bought 2 of these for my kids,and they love it"
1,Gift purchased for my five year old cousin. She has learned how to download various games and movies. She turned it on and immediately started exploring and learning how to work this device. Her mommy said it keeps her entertained and quite while riding.
1,"co worker told me about this device and the price, so i checked it out and was very happy."
1,I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features!
1,"The Fire 8 was purchased for me for after I had a knee replacement. I used it to view and check my emails, facebook, Netflix, Xfinity movies and TV shows."
1,"Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
1,My biggest gripe with it was the lack of directions. My first purchase went to the wrong card because I had no idea what the 1-click option was.
0,"Ok for kids to mess around with, but not very good quality"
1,Don't underestimate the power and versatility of this Fire. I'd definitely recommend it!
1,"wel worth the upgrade from the amazon stick to the amazon fire.. more room to catch the memory buffer, lot smoother and a better control. works wonders making me one happy customer."
1,"Very easy to set up. Can be a challenge to use with two household accounts. Requires a certain series of words to execute a command. I get a little tired of ""I don't understand your question""."
1,Works well for my 86 year old mom. She can see print very clearly.
1,"I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it's a great deal."
1,Great product although it was a bit of a wait....packed well for shipping..will order again
1,What can I say about a charger adapter. It works great.
0,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room."
1,Great value for the price. Gave them as a gift to my in-laws. They enjoy using them. Reliable name and product.
1,"This kindle is everything I wanted. No Glare, no bells and whistles, simply a device I can read a book on anywhere. I would highly recommend it!"
0,Great gift for a young teen.tereat price. Terrific.
1,This product is easy to use and take along with you
0,"If you don't care about live tv this will do great for you. Otherwise, can't ditch the cord yet."
1,The tablet was perfect for our kids. The easy to you features made it ideal for all ages.
1,"A bit pricey, but worth the money in my opinion. Perfect size and great screen!"
1,"My child loves his table. Educational material have been downloaded and he has learned his alphabets, how to spell color words, phone to sounds and is beginning to write at the age of three."
1,"Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great."
1,Added to smart home system and works great. System itself is also great to learn new things.
1,Have used other streaming devices this is by far the best and easiest to use. Good tool to help cut the cable cord
1,"I bought this for my 8year old. Perfect for her to browse the internet and access games, books, and other basic things. Parental controls included"
1,My first purchasing an Amazon product I was very thrilled with the pricing and availabilty.
1,I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
1,screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
1,Very versatile device that is constantly updated by Amazon. Price is very fair for this product.
1,"Originally purchased to practice rooting Android devices. Started using it and determined that I liked it so much I did not root it.It is by design and understandable and expected that it is tied to Amazon everything. Books, music, mp3 all are available through Amazon Underground. Not as many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offerings. NOTICE: by design, the tablet downloads and stores all files to an SD Card, if one is inserted. Solidly built, it will withstand child's play. The resolution is not super high but is very good for its size. I read using this tablet and the text is very clear. In fact, I use text readability as the test for evaluating a tablets resolution. After start up, you can go through simple process to connect this device with your Amazon account. This to allow purchases on the tablet. The parental controls are top notch. You can limit or allow as little or as much websites connections, limit purchases also. You can also load Google play on this tablet. With a little searching and downloading of files, you can download and play all Google Play Store Apps.-battery life is good.-speaker is good, single speaker only.-Blue Tooth connection easy. NOTE: if you have Sync (Microsoft) installed in your vehicle, the tablet will connect but has trouble reconnecting! It is Microsoft, what can you expect. You will have to unpair, delete from Sync then reconnect to get it to work in your vehicle.-I use this as my beater tablet for use outside as I do yard work, play music while in the shower (steamy environment), and when running around town. -It has 128GB SD Card expansionFor the money get more than one. I have 5 total and have given away several more as gifts."
1,Bought this as a gift at holiday.She loves the size and ease of use. Good reception performance.
1,THE BEST EQUIPMENT EVER I WILL RECOMMENDED TO A FRIEND
1,"This tablet proved to be an awesome gift for the kids! It doesn't have Instagram and runs a little off kilter sometimes, but good for the most part"
1,Couldn't be happier works as expected and price was fair.
1,"If you are all in on Amazon, this is the tablet for you. If you don't care about all the bells and whistles, and don't need the latest and greatest tech its a great tablet. We purchased one for my dad (60+) and he enjoys it for his web surfing and facebooking. The screen could be bigger, but for the $30 bucks we paid for it, its hard to complain."
1,I work at home and I enjoy being able to relax and just say what I want to hear and hear it. Very easy to set up too! Less than 5 minutes!
1,"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
1,Love my new Kindle Fire HD 10. I travel with it as well as use it at home. Perfect size for my needs. I own a 8in. but fount it was too small. Just ordered a keyboard to take when traveling.
1,"my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn't understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle."
1,great streaming box for watching great movies. amazon tv is fast and fluid to use. they have alot of movies.
1,"Got tablet for daughter, great tablet, size and easy to use."
1,love this tablet...very easy to use and read books on
1,I bought this gor my daughter she enjoyed that she was able to stream her videos and also do her school work.
1,"There was a ""black Friday"" special to purchase this tablet for $33 and really could not pass this up. It is intended for a toddler in times of ""crisus"". We don't have amazon prime so really it is useless until the money is spent. Product itself is fine."
1,"This is our 4th kindle and we love them as ""beginner"" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue!"
1,"Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn't work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it's hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors."
1,"Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
1,I love the kindle reader. It is great when traveling to have books to read without having to carry around multiple books. Also very easy to read outside
1,Amzon tap is great and fun Bluetooth speaker with inbuilt Alexa. I can talk it to end of the room and it can still understand my commands and plays music. Cool device and I highly recommend it.
1,The product was just what I thought it'd be. Worked right out of the box and installation.
1,"light , love the backlight., able to change font size."
1,The echo works flawlessly and integrates with many online services that I use anyway. I love it and use it daily.
1,bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime
1,Great for reading books on. Has lots of other features as well.
1,Best new technology. Very easy to install and put to good use. There are so many things it can do for you.
1,Got this tablet for my mom who isn't very tech savvy. She loves it. Can't beat the price
1,The technology just keeps getting better and better
1,I love this tablet because it is simple and portable. Easy to carry!
1,"The Kindle Fire is a great tablet for the price. Nice screen, fairly easy to use, lots of games and apps. This was a gift for my mom who isn't the most tech-saavy and she likes it a lot."
1,A fun speaker not as nice as Siri however it will do
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She liked my Kindle touch. I just wished it had an audio feature.
1,"So far, so good. I'm quite pleased with the purchase. I had an early version of Kindle (pre-touch screen) and I didn't anticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice. I still like hard copy books but reading on the Kindle Fire is quite enjoyable."
1,It's a pretty good product. Took a little getting use to navigate
1,This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.
1,Bought this tablet for my son. Great price and has great features. Camera quality is not good
1,I like this product this is a recommended item and I wo
1,I bought a couple of these for gifts for the wife & kids. They're great to use around the house while connected to WiFi.
1,"Great tablet thats ready right out of the packaging. It comes pre loaded with loads of apps and has a nice feel in the hands. screen quality is nice, the only thing i would like to see changed is the amount of time it takes the kindle to start up and shut down, it can get annoying at times. i have a 2 yo and 8yo and its held up great, dropped on cement and no cracks."
1,"I love this product. the screen is bigger, the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter loves it...so that's all that matters."
0,Bought it as a toy for my daughter to play games and watch videos.
1,This is a great tablet if you don't plan or want to spend a lot of money for one.
1,I went to purchase a new tablet because I had misplaced my old one. I told the sales person in that department that I was interested in one of the cheaper tablets that you have on display and he asked me if I had ever owned a Kendal. I told him that I had purchased 2 of them previously and really liked them. He then told me that the newest Kendal had just been delivered 2 weeks previously and it was only $48.99. I said WOW that's a great price for a Kendal and of course that is what I purchased. The sales person was very polite and professional. I really enjoyed the experience.
1,My first kindle was not paperwhite so I wasn't able to read at nights. But now I can read it whenever I want.
1,"Protective, fast and has tons of fun games already on it! Our 7 year old daughter likes it, too!"
1,Great take along and travel size. It exactly fits my needs.
1,"It works great! Alexa responds quick , easy to set up! sound is ok."
1,I bought this to test before I bought more as Christmas gifts for my grand kids. Seems to work fine
1,"I bought it for my 12 year old who likes to read. Now she LOVES to read. Her mother and I are very happy, as one could imagine. The Kindle works great, and we love the backlit touch screen."
1,This is a great tablet for the price. Gave it my not so tech savvy mom for her birthday and she loves it!
1,"for 50 bucks you will not get a better tablet. I've been waiting to buy a fire, not sure why I waited so long!"
1,Simple to use. Easily customized. Great speakers. Responds quickly. Responds to any voice. Tells good jokes. Turns on lamp for me when asked so can have light to see when entering house
1,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it."
1,"I purchased for my husband but Alexa is part of the family now. She can play anything off the internet and can interact with us if we have any questions but the best part is her ""yo momma"" jokes!"
1,Bought this for my sister. This has replaced her I Pad. She loves it.
0,The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It's thin and light.
1,Great tablet setup was easy and it seem to charge quickly..
1,Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package
1,HW and wireless handled 1080p and 4K content with no issue. Love this thing
1,Great for young children and beginners. Has all the basic features needed to enjoy this tablet
1,"We now own 4 Echos. We have them in our bedrooms and living area. It really is an amazing device. We use it to turn many of our lights on and off, control our outside sprinkler system, wakes us up with alarms, listen to all kinds of music and other information. I also use it to monitor my Amazon purchases and buy things on Amazon that we have purchased before. I understand there now are over 1000 functions it can perform depending on what you desire. Once you get one you will wonder how you lived without it."
1,"I purchased a couple of these to compliment the main unit.I have one in each room, as well in my kitchen, this way I dont have to worry if Alexa heard me or not. They work perfectly.The only downside I have seen so far is , I have a bluetooth speaker that I play music thru, and its paired with one echo, but if you are near a different echo and ask it to play music, it will not default ro the one with the speaker, but start playing thru the echo itself.I have not searched for a work around, and its possible that this is just my own setup mess up.. so I will still give 5 stars."
1,"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa."
1,Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
1,I enjoy my new Fire system and I'm glad I cut the cord.
1,"I have enjoyed my Kindle Paperwhite very, very much. It is an excellent eReader for me as my eyesight isn't what it used to be and the backlight really helps is keeping the text readable especially in low light situations. It was a wonderful Christmas present from my dear spouse."
0,I do like some things about this but I still believe it cost to much
1,IT was just as described. I would recommend it to a friend.
1,"I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with the product. Mostly used for reading but also for surfing the web, facebook, etc. Love it!!"
1,Real good deal. Nice present for those who want a tablet
1,I got this Kindle as a Christmas gift for a friend. Couldn't pass up the Black Friday price on this thing! Works great. She loves it. Success!
1,We purchase this for our son and he loves it. We are able to track his interaction online and he really loves it
1,"excellent product. very simple interface to navigate. variety of movies, games and app"
1,"My 4 yr old is fully capable of navigating to her favorite games, videos, photos, etc. I like the bumper case too. It has proved its worth already."
1,There are so many ways to use the echo that I have barely scratched the surface.
1,"We love the great products that Amazon offers!!! We can p!lay games and chat with family and friends at the same time. I never considered purchasing the tablet due to cost. However, shopping for holiday season for my family they absolutely love the products."
1,We got this for the kids grandmother to keep her occupied and it's doing a great job at it! She has NO complaints and enjoys it
1,"I was very hesitant on buying an e-reader as I didn't think spending $100 on a device that I would then need to spend $$ on books was worth it. Now that I have been using the Paperwhite, there are plenty of free books available to download. It is very easy to read in every lighting condition that I've used it in so far. Wish I would have bought it much sooner."
1,"I love the parental controls available. You can set what time they can start and stop using, as well as how much time on each activity. Also love the guarantee of replacement."
0,I ordered several of these to send to family in Haiti. They were on sale.
1,Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix
1,I will enjoy it even more once I have the apps I want downloaded. This Kindle Fire will be fun!
1,This has gotten such rave reviews from the recipient of this Christmas gift that I will be getting one for myself now.
1,"As with all kindle items, you can't go wrong. Very pleased with the backlighting. Makes it easier to read in low lighting."
1,I use the Echo every day! From getting weather to daily news to listening to SiriusXM I can say the device is very simple to use. There are so many skills you can download to make your Echo interact with Alexa in so many different ways. It goes on sale quite often so wait till it drops below $100.
1,Bought this for my daughter for christmas. She is an David reader and just loves her new fire.
1,Bought for my kids for Christmas and they both love them. Bought one for each kid.
1,"Bought two, one for each of my son's and they have had so much fun, talking to it, each have named their favorite name. Always wanted one, after going to a business meeting where one was demonstrated"
1,This one was purchased as a gift and the family absolutely loves it.
1,This is a awsome tablet and a great value love it!
1,"i play games, read books, watch movies, surf the web. love the expansion capability"
1,"I bought the Echo primarily for operating my home automation, rather than for music. I have a Sonos system that I use for music.The Echo works great enabling me to adjust the lighting and temperature at multiple homes, all from my own home. It's great because it interconnects discrete systems using my Wink hub. I have lots of Lutron Casetta wall switches and Nest cameras and thermostat which Alexa can control"
1,"For the price I think this was a ""Best Buy"" it made for a great Christmas gift"
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
1,"I brought 3 for my boys and they love it. My three year old watch mickey mouse, my 9 year ol surf the web for homework and my 15 year old use it for you tube and music even live chat with his friends."
0,Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.
1,It really does a good job of replacing my old tablets. Market could be better but that's about it.
1,Tablet is great for my 7 and 14 year old. They love it.
1,The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
1,"My last kindle died right before Christmas. I was lost with no way to read my books. Went to Best Buy to look at all the different ones available. Found that the Voyage was the best for my situation. Being backlit was perfect for the many different places I read, car, work, restaurants, and planes."
1,This is a very nice tablet for my GF who has never had one before.
0,"This device is much slower than other similar devices on the market. The internet connection is not stable, even when direct in via Ethernet."
1,Got this for my son so he could use it with Alexa. It's great
1,"I love reading!!! I was first using my iPad mini as an ereader. Originally it was purchased to be used strictly as an ereader but I found over time it was causing eye strain. I couldn't read for more that 2 hours without my eyes starting to hurt. After a little research and watching tons of Youtube videos I purchased my Paperwhite. I absolutely enjoy my kindle. It's light weight (my iPad weighs a ton), it's easy to download and access books, you can read on tons of platforms. I have been using an app called ""Overdrive"" to check out ebooks from the library. Now I don't have to get in my card and drive to my local library. I can just browse from my home via my smart phone. If you enjoy reading and your thinking about getting a kindle please do! It's the best purchase I've made in a long time! I was limited when I was using my iPad mini. Now it's like a whole new world has open up since I've started using my kindle. I have read several books by Stephen King since owning my kindle. Normally it would take me months to finish a book. Now it takes me days!"
1,"I really enjoy using the echo to learn and create new recipes. In addtion I have added quite a few skill games, radio stations and news outlets such as NPR. Every morning I ask for my morning briefing and I get a run down of the current news. In my business weather is improtant so I get my weekly weather update each morning. Echo is a great device for keeping you informed or just playing games. I plan on getting my thermostat, lights and garage door attached to Echo. Best electronic deivce I have purchased in a long time. Great value for the price."
1,For her for Christmas. I'm no dummy. I did. She loves it!
1,Very easy to use. There are lot's of different options.
1,My family loves their kindle fires. These are a good quality low price tablet that lasts about 4-5 years. We have had trouble with the charging ports going out after that time but for the price they are totally worth it
1,This is a wonderful tablet. It's lite weight and super simple to use. I bought one for myself and thinking of getting one for my grandmother.
1,"I bought this product for my girlfriend whom is technology challenged. She loves it! Helps her with drive time, shopping, weather, and much more."
1,"I bought this mostly to read the Walking Dead comics on and a book here and there. It works great for that. A slightly bigger screen would be better for the comics, but bigger screens don't come for under $50. I can't speak to quality of video streaming or anything, but it performs well for reading."
1,so beautiful and system is very good and the app is good too.
1,I returned this with the reader in the same box.
1,We bought this for our 2 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! It has so many apps and videos for her to watch. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child.
1,Alexa is now part of the family. We have integrated her with our smart things hub and along with apps like ifttt she works great.
1,"This is a superior product. Easy setup, easy to use. Reasonably priced and great for the book worm who loves reading."
1,"I enjoy how small this version is, although if you are looking for a lot of features, I would recommend other Kindle products. Pretty much, this is similar to carrying around a paperback book in size and portability."
1,"Great in helping me stay organized; it's instant entertainment, it's instant information, and it aides in securing my home. Awesome is an understatement!"
1,"I purchased this tablet for my mother for the camera, reading books, and emailing. Awesome price and value!"
1,Love it hours of movies ...........................
1,"Great budget tablet, a lot of features, easy interface and wonderful picture"
1,"great storage for a Samsung phone, especially for its price"
1,"Was told by family fire tablet. was best had opportunity to play with one went. Immediately to purchase one,then to find out it was on sale I was happy. February I will purchase Comcast or Netflix for. Birthday. From Best buy"
1,easy to use very portable. I now have 2 fire tablets the 7 and an 8.8. the new 7 is so much faster.
0,"II like that you can undo Emails, if you accidentally deleted them."
1,"Very nice assistant, except for the alexa commands are just in english"
1,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality
1,"I was pleasantly surprised to see the Kindle for sale IN the store!! I love my Kindle, especially since I was able to expand the memory! I love that it's portable, to be honest, when given the choice, I find my self on my Kindle over my laptop.The only thing I can complain about, is why in the world Amazon choose s to make it nearly a miracle to find a case for its most popular model?????If you don't have a Kindle, you don't know what your missing!!"
1,"Great tablet for the price, the only problem I have had is getting it linked to Mr printer."
1,"These kindlewhites are awesome! never thought I'd give up holding a real book, but the whites are just too convenient!"
1,Love it. I would recommend to anyone who like streaming tv.
1,The Amazon Echo is fun and easy to set-up and use. Very useful.
1,Purchased many of these for Christmas for my nieces and nephews. They were and are still soo excited !
1,Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need.
1,"I am just learning all the possible functions of my Kindle Fire, but it already does what I bought it for. I hope that I will get more enjoyment as I explore it more fully."
0,"Just like the reviews said, the Netflix app buffers every few minutes...AWFUL.....now I only have to glimpse that spinning red circle and my blood pressure rises. (I was hoping I would be one of the minority. =( ) . I finally yanked the HDMI cable and attached it to my computer to finish watching my program.I'm not returning the Amazon Fire-TV yet, because I recently acquired Amazon Prime and I've been hearing great things about their selection of movies, etc. Will update after I've used it for that."
1,This version is perfect. Spending another hundred or so is definitely not necessary! I can do everything on this and it is just as fast and clear as the more expensive one. No regrets!
1,I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend
1,Good tablet for my wife to use for social media and looking up items for remodeling our house.
1,"Have tried using an iPad and other devices for reading, I was worried this would not work for my needs. Light as a book, even lighter, I don't mind laying in bed or reclining on the couch to read anymore. Good for reading heavier books that would cause arm strain to hold while reading. Bright at night enough to read with the lights off but not bright enough to bother my wife who is sleeping"
1,If you're looking for an android alternative to a Windows-based desktop this makes a great option
1,"this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school"
1,"MAJOR KEY... You need this in your life .. If you buy anything else besides this congratulations ""Ya played Yourself"" #BlessUp"
1,This is a very good product my kids do homework on it
0,"The echo is certainly able to answer many questions but it is inferior to the Google Home. We bought both and use them side by side and the Home is able to retrieve answers or information that the Echo is not on a somewhat frequent basis. Examples are questions or requests such as ""how many calories are in a pop-tart"", searching for certain songs or types of music, and calculating time and distance between two cities by car. The Home was able to do all of these things while the Echo was not. The home also tends to provide information beyond the direct answer to your question while the Echo does not. The Echo definitely has superior sound quality but I'm not sure it's worth it."
0,"I have a hard time navigating the menus and use is not intuitive,"
1,"So happy with this Kindle! It's very easy to use, lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book, except here you have an entire library with you.It's easy to download books, you can set up a wish list, read several books at the same time and you never loose your page.The screen lights are fantastic when you read in the dark, and there's absolutely no glare when you read in the sun.The only drawback is that I thought I would be able to purchase books on any amazon site so that I could read books in French if they're not available on the U.S. site, and it turns out you can't. You can only purchase the ebooks from the country your Kindle is set up. That was a real disappointment, as I had read some reviews before buying it where they said you could...Overall, I absolutely love it and if you're a book worm like i am, than I would absolutely recommend it. I would actually recommend it to any one."
1,"Has everything you need... Movies, Tv, apps and game's in a nice interface"
1,very fast n nice ui but controller quality not great! dropped onced n middle part now rattles but the app controller works great and all apps n games are quick
1,"Amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the AWS engine behind it, there's a lot of opportunity for development, both from the community as well as Amazon. Naturally they favor interaction with services they sell, so others will need to build links to others, but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already. The price of this TAP was outstanding, adding it to my existing ECHO and now considering a DOT."
1,With an Amazon Prime account you have access to a good set of channels. To replace broadcast TV you still need additional service accounts.
1,Bought this for my daughter n she loves it!! So glad I got it for her
1,Really cool tech!!! I like the versatility of this item. I would recommend to everyone!!
1,Love it. It does all I need and then some. Great price and great features.
0,I have yet to use it as I do not know how. I need help!
1,I love this item because my three children can use it ages 11 to 15. The screen is fenomenal.
1,This was a great buy as a first tablet for a child. Clear picture and easy to use.
1,I love this charger...charges my devices super fast and I don't have to wait hours
1,This was a replacement Kindle for our grandson. loved it
0,Cheap tablet but solid built. Weak audio and poor camera.
1,This is a better option then the fire stick for your main Tv. The fire sticks are good for bedrooms but the fire TV has 4k and is much faster. I like that it can be wired to get the max speed from my internet.
1,"Works great for my 5 year old, bought a child case and is just the right size for him to play games and watch movies."
1,"Best Buy was running a sale on these and I thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I'm an Apple guy so Siri has been my ""go to"" virtual assistant. I must say that I am duly impressed with Alexa. She seems to understand me better than Siri does. All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better. But none have all the convenience of Alexa, Bluetooth, Wifi and portability in one package.I'll be buying more as Christmas gifts!"
1,"We've had one of these for a while now. Very reliable, easy to use and great looking display. All in all a good purchase for the price"
1,This has been the best tablet for my son. It is durable and easy to use.
1,I'm an Amazon Prime & Netflix costumer and I just love this thing. I no longer have Comcast TV only antenna and two Fire TV's. Absolutely love it. It's fast as long as my internet is good.
1,Purchased as a gift. Very well pleased. Best Buy is great for all electronics purchases.
1,This has been a tremendous item. I'm so glad I did my research and picked this piece for online television.
1,Does everything my kindle did for half the price!!
1,"We bought this for our 7 year old and at first we had some issues loading things, but things seem to be working great now. He loves it and he can play games and load apps. Just what we wanted it for."
1,This is a nice reader that we gave to our granddaughter. She enjoys he childrens books she can read and we enjoy the limited Wi-Fi capabilities.
1,Great as expected great customer service. I've gotten this before and it's great
1,I purchased this tablet for my daughter. I can set parental controls and it has lasted her for a while.
1,Just what I needed. Perfect
1,"The echo works well, has good sound and is an interesting concept. Where it falls short is in the quality of the search results. It often responds that it doesn't understand the question or does not have information about what is asked. I have returned and will purchase the Google home system when it is released."
1,It responds better to my husbands voice than mine but it's been helpful and very easy to use.
1,Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo!
1,I am very happy with my new fire tablet. it is easy to use
1,"Purchased this is a replacement for a television during a move. So far, I haven't been missing the programs. Kindle makes reading easy, accessible and fun. I take it with me everywhere I go during the day (I live in a busy metro area) and it fits neatly into my backpack. Great for bike commuters or train riders. Accessible, cheap entertainment with a fantastic build quality.**Side note: I originally bought a basic Kindle, and traded up for this. Very glad I did! It is much better than the original, and the 300 dpi plus back light makes a huge difference."
1,I was over at a friends house and they had one of these and i could not get here fast enough to get one of my own!
1,This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
1,I was very shock how fast this tablet is. It's just the right size and speed; the performance is better than most of the tablets in this price range. Go and get one.....its perfect for the young ones.
1,The fire 7 is easy to read books and stuff. The kids love playing games on it. We really love the tablet.
1,I haven't gotten all of the skills Alexa can do but it is a good product that plays my music well.
1,I like it kids like it definitely needs a case so 4 stars 5 if it had case
1,"WORKS PERFECTLY, NO GLICHES. GREAT SIZE FOR TRAVEL AND IS GOOD IN BRIGHT OR DIM LIGHT."
1,I have a lot of reading to do as a teacher. This is a perfect product and easy on the eyes.
1,"Love the tablet, easy to use and loaded with fun for the whole family"
1,"The Paperwhite is a decent enough product for someone wanting an eInk screen. I don't understand some of the lack of customization options, even on what seems to be simple things. Like why can't I see the TIME in the status bar? Why can't I customize the ""click zones"". Also, contrary to Amazon's claims, my PC app does NOT sync the documents that I emailed to the device (the Android App does, though). I also see their ads when the device is off and starts. If they gave me the ability to save those recommendations (as opposed to ""read now""), I might have checked a couple of them out by now. Still, for the money, it gets the job done and helps keep my eyes from getting as tired as they did when I just used my phone to read."
1,My in laws looove this tech. They are soon going to be adding more wireless items in the house!
1,With the 64G micro card I was able to load lot of my music. Use it in my truck with a Braven HD Bluetooth speaker.
1,"It is by far the best piece of electronics I have purchased (ok, to an extent). Better than Siri and asking for any song to be played at any moment you are thinking of it is amazing!"
1,"I'm never paying for cable again! I'm so pleased with Amazon Fire box, we watch all our favorite tv shows and new. We have it all. And no $300 per month bill!"
1,So far so good. My son loves it for his room and gives him ability to watch netflix
1,good product for a best price! highly recommended! 4K supported!
0,"works for what needed, watching netfix app is done"
1,"I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
1,"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do – including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source."
1,I'll never go back to books - Very easy to use and comfortable on the eyes
1,"This is a great product from concept to execution and constantly expanding functionality and capability!Also, very unexpected sound quality from this little tube! IMPRESSIVE!"
1,I love my fireTV! We have a firestick in every room and added the firetv box to our new 4k TV. Awesome
1,"needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
1,i bought this to replace a old apple tv works great
1,"It was a gift for my little sister, she seems to love it and it does everything that she needs it to do. No problems so far"
1,Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter
1,"I am pleasantly surprised with Amazon's new 5th Generation Kindle Fire.As a purchaser of a 1st Generation Kindle Fire, I welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microSD slot. This version of the Fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device.The new OS seems to work well in spite of the ""commercial"" aspect. After finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my Fire became more enjoyable. This feature was not a surprise but what I would expect in a device from Amazon and its ecosystem.The Kindle Fire is an excellent 7-inch tablet for its $50 price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablets for the newby."
0,"Lot of ads from amazon. Other than that, good for light use"
1,"So far so good. Works as expected, but it will be more useful when we purchase additional accessories to connect it to more parts of the house. Voice recognition is excellent even from another room."
1,"Great product. I have two of these and a couple of the POD's. These are great for listening to music, solid built in speaker and the POD with Bose bluetooth speakers is only a slight improvement. I'm already buying two more of these for Christmas gifts"
1,I haven't put my Fire Tablet down since I got it at Christmas time on sale. Got one for my wife and niece.
1,"Great to view movies, play games, surf the net. Makes shopping on Amazon music easy"
1,Great product. Would recommend to a friend. Love it love it love it.
1,Awesome
1,"Love it, love it!!! Have had several different models. like this one the best. The Kindle Fire was nice but had a hard time reading at night."
1,Great to replace internet 5 day weather forecaster that stopped working. Nice looking display & easy to use. Price was great !
1,Really impressed with the functionality of this device
1,Love the echo... amazing devise with all what u need in 1 product.Great buy
1,Alexa works pretty well at home parties and the price isn't too bad for what you get.
1,Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities
1,Great tablet for kids they love it it is also great that you can download music and movies through Amazon Prime
1,"Spots on both sides of the screen make it easy to move from page to page, both forwards and backwards. Light is great for both night and day reading."
1,a high quality experience with more choices all the time.
1,great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend !
1,"The bargain tablet of the century, performance, convenience, and decent screen. Runs all the apps you need."
1,"My daughter was 27 and had never owned a tablet, she loved it!She uses it constantly"
1,I would purchase another one just for myself and son
1,Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
1,"Boy! If I had something like this when I was a kid. The learning devices these kids have today. Makes learning about different things in & around the world a fun experience. all the other activities & downloadable apps, they can be on it for hours. Like it!"
1,"I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
1,So far this tablet has been efficient. It kinda bad is difficult to use and it seems to require a lot of steps to get the kids profiles set up and it actually does not do everything I hoped it would.
1,STILL IN SHOCK ALL THE TABLET CAN DO FOR $50!ITS A NO BRAINER
1,I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
1,For the price you can not buy anything better! It's great! It's easy! And I would by more any day!
1,Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
1,i got this for my 4 year old granddaughter for her to you tube and its great.
1,"I purchased this so my wife and I could each have a kindle. It works fine but did notice some flaws in the kindle as far as the screen, some spots inside the screen where they do not light up correctly. Haven't taken it back yet to see if it can be fixed."
1,The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that
1,"I absolutely love the Kindle Paperwhite! It is my first e-reader but it's won me over! I had to choose between the Kindle and the Nook. Each had it's advantages and the only reason that the Kindle won out was because of my obsessive usage of Amazon. I don't like that it uses a proprietary format (other formats are usable such as PDF.) but there are workarounds out there...The screen is crisp and looks just like paper. I barely notice the e-ink refreshing and I can read for hours without discomfort. The built in light is great for night reading and it's so light!Overall, a great device and if you can wait there are price drops fairly often.9/10. Would buy again."
1,I really like the tablets. My grand kids enjoy them a lot.
1,This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun
1,"Oh my, I can't say enough for things about this device. I've been a loyal firestick user for one a year now, I've switched to the box back in may and it was well worth the extra 50 bucks. 80 times faster, live TV works incredibly."
1,"My kids loved this tablet and use it almost every day, battery life is pretty good for how much they use it"
1,Bought it for my daughter she reads a lot she had the reader version for years but went blank
1,"I purchased this device as a gift and I got a positive review from many sources. It is good for the eyes and does what it is intended for. Price could be little bit cheaper, other wise there is no complain amazon kindle has a lot of source for books"
1,"Nice product for the price , very good tablet for beginners"
1,"I purchased the kindle, because actual books are heavy and take up to much room. The kindle works fast, and is easy to use."
1,My wife likes it because she can read all different kind of books
0,Good tablet for reading books you love... still need to get used to it since all I have used in the past are apple products .
1,"Compared to Roku provides more flexibility for those who like to use these units beyond standard. I don't give 5 stars because the interface is okay, but I much prefer Plex's looking view.I was going insane with my slow Samsung ""Smart Hub"" tv on my second TV... purchasing this was a good decision.Overall I recommend these units."
1,"I love all the apps on fire tv. The only negative is, it doesn't come with a hdmi cord."
1,"On the down side, I don't have a smart home yet, so essentially this is just a talking clock for my bedroom. On the upside, it is SUCH a COOL talking clock! The potential for apps and websites I use to extend it is quite breathtaking. So far, I've used it to: - Play music from my Amazon Music account - Read audio books from Audible - Play music over Bluetooth from my iPhone - Play live radio from TuneIn - Play brief news reports from the BBC, PBS and The Economist - Add items to my grocery list (from OurGroceries) - Check my budget (from YNAB) - Check my Amazon order status - Buy Amazon products I've bought before - Checking the time in different countriesI'm looking forward to integrating it with more smart home toys someday!I'm not sure it's worth full price at 180$, but Best Buy currently has it on sale for 90$, which is a great price! I hope my meditation app gets on it eventually, and that some day they incorporate notifications in a smart way to it."
1,Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
1,Didn't already said great! Minimum fifty characters?
1,At this price this is a fantastic product. Good for reading as well as watching movies whilst traveling.
1,"I picked this up during Black Friday and managed to get it cheaper than MSRP. My girlfriend and I have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else. It's very useful, and since we weren't looking for anything with deep features, it was well worth the price."
0,"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund"
1,"I bought this for my son to occupy him on car trips. If you are an Amazon Prime member, then this really makes sense to own"
1,I have multiple fire devices in my home. They work great and allow me to access tons of content from 4K down to SD.
1,I like it and it serves it's purpose. I use it mainly to read my e-books and surf the net so it's great especially for the price! :)
1,Gave this to in laws as a Christmas gift. It was by far the gift of choice!!
1,Awesome little tablet. Kids love it and they use it all the time.
0,horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
0,"Love voice controlling my lites and small appliances, but there are some bugs to work out, sometimes have to ask twice, sometimes does not recognise them, but I am patient, uses Bing as a search, not impressed,"
1,It is pretty bright and the battery for this device last pretty long.
1,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, after I had bought an Amazon echo dot for myself, and I would recommend this to anyone who is considering to automate your house."
1,I love these. Works great.nothing like plug and play.
1,"I bought this for my 3 yr old grandson & it has taught him his ABC's, his numbers, his colors, animal sounds and more!! Very kid friendly and he loves his "" tabo"" as he calls it!!"
1,Its good for going on the internet and doing minor things. Some of the pictures on the internet have been enlarged to look out of focus.
1,Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
1,Able to watch Amazon Prime now on our smart TV. Easy install and breeze to work!
0,I'm not to Happy with product. Very cheap .I wouldn't recommend it anyone
1,"The Amazon Echo is a lot of fun to have. I use it for streaming music from Amazon and also as a Bluetooth speaker with my phone. Set up took about two minutes- very easy.. Getting it to play music is a lot easier and quicker than scrolling through my stored albums/artist. I'm going to try the 30 trial for Amazon's new music service. I expected it to have an even fuller range of music available. Also, my wife likes Alexa's jokes."
1,This item helps my parents enjoy TV viewing easier with its overall simplicity.
0,It's ok. I love that I can set up my 5 year old on his own with the children's setting. The battery dies really fast though. We can't even make it through a long car ride without having to plug it in.
1,Wound up finding one at Best Buy when no one else had any. I absolutely have found my new favorite gadget in the Echo and have found so many fun things it can do to help organize my life.
1,The Paperwhite Kindle is awesome. Lightweight and easy to use. I can dim the backlight so that I don't disturb my husband when I read in bed at night.
1,A very useful and easy to use tablet. I use it almost everyday.
1,"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
1,Friendly user for kids enjoyed being able to read books.
1,Bought it for my mom for Christmas so she won't use up all her data on her phone. So far she is really enjoying it and likes the screen size. Great tablet for someone who is looking to just begin.
1,"It is fun to read with the dictionary and footnote at your finger tip. The key benefits is the easy reading with the background light, would not drain your eye after hours of reading. Ordering books from Amazon is easy and cheaper than buying the hard copy. Love it!"
0,My daughter loves her tablet. However we had to replace the first one we bought as it couldn't connect to the wifi properly. The second one works fine now.
1,This is simply the best and most TV for the money. I should have cut the cable years ago!
1,These boxes are simply amazing! Great for everyone
1,"Second generation Kindle finally died, and already have Android tablets, but the Kindle app on those tablets isn't easy to read and the tablets are heavy.This new Paperwhite Kindle is awesome for reading only, and is lightweight with extremely long battery life.Best dedicated Kindle product yet."
1,"Portable, good battery life, easy to read in pretty much any light. It doesn't have all the frills like the Kindle Fire, but if all you're looking to do is read, this is what you need."
1,This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend
1,This is a very good starter tablet. We have purchased several others that did not perform as well. The no-name brands do not have the clear display that this one does.
1,Always worthwhile to have 2 or more.
1,"Holding the Kindle Paperwhite is like holding a paperback book. It is formatted to be a book. Yes, I have an iPad and mini but the Kindle is much lighter and more ""book-like."" It can hold 100s, if not 1000s, of books."
1,better than original kindle fire. definitely more functional
1,This was a great Christmas present for my daughter!
1,The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.
1,"This is a very well made tablet. If you can deal with the Amazon pre loaded apps, it is very fast. Simple to use and the best tablet for the price."
0,Alexa is nice but it lacks a lot of informayion when asking questions. It's not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer. Only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the Alexa app itself to work. Still working on Alexa so maybe that could be the reason but I though it would be like Siri that you can ask anything.
0,This is a neat product but did not fit my needs.I have several bluetooth devices and some could not be recognized so I did return it. Might be good for others as what did work worked ok.
1,"Easy and enjoyable to use! Had the original and wasn't sure I'd like the change, but I do!"
1,I love it because it give me access to all my favorite shows
1,This tablet is a steal at this price. I would dare say it offers more per dollar than a high end tablet.
1,Awesome tablet at a good price..I love the size of the tablet
1,Best streaming device on the market and flawless 4K streaming without the restrictions of Apple TV
1,This is the best assistant on the market. Voice recognition is great.
1,Great product. Works perfect and connects with my Logitech elite remote and controls music tv etc
1,It is easy to use and got of fun and popular apps. It is also quite good to use on the go and good camera.
1,"I purchased 2 of these tablets for my kids for Christmas. They seem to like it and the quality is really good for a less expensive tablet. Amazon also offers games for free that usually cost money, so they are able to get more games as I am not one to buy games on devices. It only has 8g memory but I purchased a micro SD card for both for more storage. It's fairly easy for the kids to navigate. Overall it's a great tablet for the price."
1,Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
1,I got this to replace one I broke. I chose this one because I love the color.
1,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nephew and he loves it.
1,I absolutely LOVE my new Kindle! I'll never run out of good books to read again! Best Buy had it delivered 3 days before I even expected it to arrive. Couldn't be happier ☺
1,Bought them for a 5 yr old and 7 yr old great for easy to use kid apps and learning games
1,"it's very easy and light to use and the back light is very similar to real paper, so it's my best friend anywhere especially in bed before falling a sleep"
1,So happy I decided to purchase the Echo! It's really easy to use & the sound is great!
1,We purchased 3 of these tablets on Black Friday as Christmas gifts for our oldest three children. We already have one at home that they share. We all love this little tablet and are very happy with its performance so far. It's perfect for the apps they use at school and for the kids' games as well. The App Store has so many great apps for free...!
1,"I would have preferred to purchase a 3G kindle, but this item was not in stock and I needed it in a hurry. This kindle does everything that I need although not as versatile as my old kindle."
1,I purchased this product for my 10yr old he uses it for everything. I'm a teacher I recommend this product for all ages excellent tool for school assignments as well .
1,My grandson is enjoying his tablet. He uses it for games and communicating with me.
1,Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on.
1,"Very good for the price. A lot of good, free games."
1,As expected but cost too much. I felt amazon should have covered the failed power supply under warranty but this fixed it.
1,Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
1,Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.
1,I love this Kindle. I have read about 7 book since I bought it and I used to only read about two a year
1,"Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space"
1,Bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Tab that was about 3 years old and seemed to be running slow and was a bit heavy for a 7inch tablet. This is much lighter and since I will probably use it mostly to read books and play games like candy crush it is fast and easy to use. Very happy with it so far.
1,"We mostly use our Echo to play Jeopardy and check the weather. That seems stupid, but it's really nice to have in the house. We also like to send messages to our friends who also have an echo. I hope they integrate a better search database so we can eventually use Alexa like we use our Google Assistant on our phones. She doesn't know much without having the search the web and send the info to your phone."
1,Love it so far. Looking forward to connect whatever I can. It made my life easy already.
1,We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
0,"If you're just going to read and play a game or two, maybe surf the internet a bit, this is an ok tablet. But if you are a heavy user, I'd tell you to pass on this tablet because it won't keep up with your surfing/games/e-mail."
1,This is a great Kindle - it is convenient for school and travel!
1,The best tv box !! Fast and hard. I love amazon thanks
1,Gave up my tablet for the voyage and haven't looked back. A pleasure to read on.
1,Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.
1,"Amazon Fire TV is a great addition to our household. It offers tons of programs and I love getting my amazon prime movies this way. Easy to install, easy to navigate the menu, and an overall A+ in my book."
1,"For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good"
1,I bought this for my child who is very hard on things. She loves it.
1,"This unit is just like a member of the family, it answers questions, plays my favorite music and gives me reminders!"
1,I was able to run this fire tablet with Kodi and now this tablet kicks @$$
1,I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it!
1,Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
1,"I just look at the instructions,buy some cable wires,make sure you have internet,walahhh"
1,"I bought a kindle fire to read on as well as do other tasks but found that I really disliked reading on the fire. I decided to purchase the paperwhite and love it. In the month that I have owned it, I have already read several books. The screen is very comfortable on your eyes and lighting is never an issue. I highly recommend the paperwhite."
1,"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
1,"ilovemy kindle 8"" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8"" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know."
1,I compared it to the kindle fire hd and didn't see much of a difference. Love it!
1,As this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but I will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the Kindle intact. I am very happy with this purchase as is the child. Not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.
1,It's not as simple as cable but much cheaper and compact.
1,"I am so pleased with my Echo, I bought another for my granddaughter. As a youngster, she loves the ""on demand"" music."
1,"Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go!"
1,The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
1,Works fine. Charges as described.
1,"Love it, easy to program to our wifi devices. Would recommend"
1,"Easy to install, just requires internet connection. If you have an amazon prime account you have access to all kinds of movies and shows like a hulu or netflix account would work. There are also apps that you can download and purchase that will alllow you to watch other shows and even play games. Since installing the firestick we have gotten rid of one cable box because we can just watch so many other things on the firestick and have helped cut down on our bills. Who doesn't like saving money?"
1,This was a gift and is being enjoyed. Glad I purchased it
1,Love it. My second Kindle. Carry it with me all time. A crazy reader's favorite.
1,"I now have 2 Kindles but chose my new Fire so I can have my email, etc at my fingertips."
1,Bought this tablet as a gift for my daughter. Pretty sure she will love it!
1,This is a great tablet for the price. Great for traveling!
1,"Love the Tap, plays my daughter' s music. Works well if you are a Amazon Prime member."
1,like better than the 7 inch Kindle better to read.
1,I purchase this tablet on Black Friday for my classroom while at work and my toddler while at home. Pros-I've mainly used it at work for Class Dojo and it's good for that purpose. At home I've used it for a Fisher Price ABC app. Both run okay with minimum lag. Cons-The volume is very low and the ads are annoying but for what I'm using it for it works.
1,"I have two Echos in my home, I use it mostly for listening to my Spotify playlists and ordering stuff online off Amazon. I also love the ease of creating shopping lists and the fact that new abilities are added everyday. I just wish it was a lot more intuitive, I want Alexa to learn tricks on its own and not have to teach it tricks. I would give the Echo 4 stars for current functionality which is limited and 5 stars for future potential. Must have."
1,My 1 year old loves his tablet. He knows how to utilize it very well. It needs a better camera.
1,"This has proven to be one of my most clever purchases ever. It suits my needs perfectly and it""s super easy to add new books that I want."
1,The Amazon Fire TV Box with 4K streaming works very well.
1,"I bought the Amazon Echo for my husband because he loves music. I was expecting the sound to be okay, but not for it to sound as good as it does. The speakers are of excellent quality. He is very pleased with the quality of the sound, as am I.Even though we use the Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling the forecast and adding items to our shopping list, to be perfectly honest, I’d love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and I hate having to unplug and move her."
1,I got this for watching movies on the go. I just put a bunch of movies on a micro sd card and it plays them. Good value for the price.
1,"Its a steal at 33.33$. I bought the second version of Kindle fire 3 years ago. And its still running great, even with respect to battery life. I have gifted everyone in my relation. Bought around 10 of them for gifting."
1,Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
1,Works as advertised.l
1,"Great value for money. However, the screen lags a bit after input. Once you figure that out, then you just need to be a bit patient."
1,"The Fire Tablet is a great eReader. I bought it primarily to read my eBookson Kindle. Much lighter and easier to read compared to my Samsung Tablet. Even though there is less text on a page - I can read faster with the Fire Tablet. Also, the Silk browser works great for my needs - can Read emails, Flipboard and Pulse. The Fire Tablet Rocks!!!Richard"
1,"I have used the Kindle app on an iPad and Android tablet and phone and I love it. This is my first Kindle device, so I can't compare it to previous Kindle versions. The only drawback to using the Kindle app on the previoulsy-mentioned devices is that they can't be seen in direct sunlight. And that is the biggest advantage I see to owning a Kindle--you can read outside in daylight. Also, the kindle is very light and portable and easy to use. It does what it says it will do and you can't beat the battery life. The X-ray feature is also a bonus that you don't get with the app."
1,"Unbelievable price, and everyone loves it (I Bought 6 for gifts)"
1,This tablet is so compact and fit in my purse. It works very well.
1,I bought this as a Christmas present for my young nephew. Easy Wi-Fi set up and works great .
1,"Glad to get the geek squad back. The tablet is great, best gift I could have gotten"
1,This is a great table for the price. I purchased it so my grandchildren would leave my ipad alone. Its not an ipad but I have no complaints for the price. I find myself using it a lot playing games and surfing the internet. It is pretty fast and easy to use. I told my daughter about it and she purchased 2 for her twins.
1,Gave this as a gift for Christmas to my daughter's family. They loved it!
1,"I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for one of my grandchildren, so they won't get it until then. It hasn't even been opened at this time. Overall rating is based on product reviews."
1,"We loved it so much that my husband surprised me with the Echo for Christmas, but I also surprised him with one. It is so much more than just music. You can ask Alexa anything from jokes to weather to music to technical questions. It is a great addition to our home. Looking forward to discovering all that it is capable of."
1,"very good tablet for little kids , need more memory which is you can buy sd card for it"
1,Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop.
1,"Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies,"
1,Got this for my wife and I think she was able to use it maybe a week before our kid stole it. He loves the thing.
1,Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
1,Works well for children. It is user friendly and easy to use.
1,Exactly what I wanted and needed would recommend to anyone
1,"As a ebooker reader this is absolutely best in the market right now, very easy to use. Now the only downside is the feeling of touch screen is too rough."
1,"this was purchased for a friend, and his family. They are enjoying it and his kids tell me that they move it from room to room."
1,"A nice tablet for the price. No a-lot of meaningful competition at this price range, which makes the Fire tablet an easy selection for the price conscious buyer."
1,All the capabilities of Kindle and easy on the eyes!
0,Just my . opinion but i like the Apple tv better. Just easier to use
1,Our family enjoys using Alexa and discovering all the things she can do. We Enjoyed it so much that we also purchased 2 dots.
1,Love the voice feature and since going to this I have saved tons on cable bills
1,love it.....Alexa listens well and plays songs I like
1,"I have the larger 8.9 hdx Kindle but find it cumbersome when going places. Plus sometimes I am places where I shouldn't necessarily have my kindle with me. I needed something small and concealable, just for reading books. This is PERFECT!!! I would have rated it 5 starts but two weeks after I bought the black one they introduced a purple one. GRRRRR!!!"
1,"This has a great UI. I've used all the different streaming devices and this is by far the cleanest, fastest, and offers a lot of app selections.Works great with Playstation Vue!"
0,Screen was cracked but the package did arrive earlier than expected
1,I have never had a problem with Kindle and would recommend them to anyone.
1,Got this for my mother in law for Christmas as one of her presents and she loves it!
1,I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.
0,"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings."
1,I bought this as gift for daughter and son-in-law. It was easy to set up and has worked perfectly. It's been a lot of fun so I'm going to get one for myself!
1,"Easy to use, I'm able to move it to other tvs in the house and bring it with us on vacation"
1,Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She would use her Mom's phone to watch her shows but now that she has her tablet she can watch her own and see it much better. Homerun on this Christmas present!
1,I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
1,My 7 year old daughter loves this tablet for games and watching Netflix and Hulu. Great size for her. I like the parental controls and easy to monitor her activity and how much time a day she can use it.
1,I love amazon fire tv the shows a great and the movies are outstanding. Good job Amazon
1,I absolutely love the kindle fire my boyfriend got it for my two youngest children who are five n six n must say I love the restriction time and parental control out of everything!
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is a great device to have while flying on long trips. It helps to past the time and it is very easy to use and transport in your personal luggage.
1,i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
1,This Kindle Fire is very durable I believe that she can drop it a few times and it won't hurt it a bit so wonderful easy learn product for grandkids
1,We got these for my kids for Christmas and they absolutely love them. All I did was set up a free time account for them to play and watch videos. Best part is that's all they can do so I don't have to worry about them going anywhere off limits.
1,Regulat TV has taken a beck step to the Fire product. Footbal and sports access in general makes this a great option to cable TV.
1,"Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
1,A friend told me about this item and it's a great deal !!
1,It is easy to install and upgrade. Love the clarity
1,Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.
1,I travel with this device everywhere! I love having access to my entire library on a simple to use device. The paper white screen is easy on the eyes and battery power!
1,Previous kindle user updating to the paperwhite. Easy to read screen and the 3g is a good feature to have while traveling.
1,Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
1,I was skeptical of such a low price point tablet. My children broke a more expensive tablet that I owned and I needed a replacement. I absolutely love it.
1,This is a good value but I purchased a Kindle Fire Black Friday of 2015 and I have to say it has more features and now I am spoiled. It is a 16 gb storage also. I want another one like it in case mine ever quits.
1,This was a gift for my daughter. She wanted it to catch up on reading some books. Being able to browse the web was an added plus.
1,Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it's so user friendly she's able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance.
1,We think she's great! We're learning things every day!
1,"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
1,I bought this tablet for my daughter and I love the parental control features! The tablet works wonderfully with excellent memory for storage!
1,It does most everything the higher priced tablets do. The advertising is annoying. It's possible to combine all of the icons for stuff you never use or want into one icon file.
1,"Quick delivery, great tablet, met all our needs...would recommend"
1,We are so enjoying our Alexa Amazon Echo. We especially enjoy the music and stations.
1,"I was not sure I wanted to get this new device, but I have found that it helps me a lot through out my day when I just need to remind myself to do something before I leave the house or after sometime of not getting it down. Every morning asking about weather instead of having to open a webpage. Love my Alexa and look forward to continue growth with her"
1,outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
0,"I looked at the reviews and they varied greatly. I didn't want an electric sharpener, so my choices were very limited. This pencil sharpener is adequate and suits my needs because I don't use pencils very often, but it is very slow and sounds like it's straining."
1,purchased as a gift for my 8 year old niece she absolutely loves it and it is easy for her to use. Mom loves the parental settings on it as well!
1,Love this device! Processor is fast enough to stream Netflix & Hulu without buffering but also has enough memory for the kids to download games and pandora and their apps that the love. Pay the extra $$$ and get a quality streaming device.
1,Easy to set up. Lots of great apps to pick from to expand its usefulness. Great selection of music.
1,quick easy to use
1,Great price. Very Easy to use. My grandson loves it.
1,Easy to setup. Great voice recognition. Shopping list app is wonderful!
1,Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
1,Such a great reading tablet it has a back light perfect for reading in the dark
1,More memory and better processor than the fire stick! This is the way to go!
1,It's a great tablet for the price... my kids love it...great parental controls
1,I really like it. Easy to use and very friendly. L
1,Enjoying the Fire for reading & more; still exploring all the uses
1,I never knew our family would enjoy the Echo so much! My wife wanted one bad and Mother's Day was quickly approaching. At first I thought it was expensive and redundant to the technology we already have in our home. Boy was I wrong!! I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's now a member of our family!! Haha
1,I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.
1,Bought this as a gift for my mom and couldn't be more pleased at how she is enjoying it.
1,It was a great present for my grandma. It is very easy to use.
1,"This product is convenient for voice controlling the environment, lighting and relaxing with music or voice calls. I would like to see it have the ability to connect with other echoes to create a surround sound effect or have the ability to add sound to Chromecast."
1,"Great buy , bought eight of them everyone uses them daily and they enjoy them"
1,This workshould so much better then the firend stick.
1,Like the fact I can watch netflix on it. Daughters loved theirs!
1,The Fire TV is very easy to setup and allows you to access a lot content.
1,"Great piece of hardware for the price - maybe needs a slgihtly better app selection, but 4K compatible and microSD card slot makes this a a great device for streaming video."
1,My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
1,Very good purchase for the price and back lit option is really usefult o read at night without having to have the lights on
1,"With this amazing toy, you won't need to pay for outrageous monthly cable bills, just buy this and no more cable bills."
1,My kid loved hers so much that I bought one for my son. Wonderful and easy for the kids!!
1,The Echo is growing on me. It can give you weather or traffic or sport scores. All without lifting a finger. It can tell me how many steps on my Fitbit. It's learning new things all the time. It great. I recommend it. The possibilities are endless.
1,"This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!"
1,"Echo is a great first step into using smart things. Linking it with your amazon account allows you to stream music from amazon prime or your amazon cloud. you can add items to shopping lists, ask questions, etc. You can then start adding smart devices in the home to control. The possibilities continue to grow."
1,Purchased for my 8 Year old easy to use and can take a hit. Can't tell u how many times he has dropped it and it works great!
1,Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.
1,Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though.
1,Works great charges reasonably fast I'm satisfied with it.
1,I got this awesome gadget to use it with my 4 k tv.
0,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
1,Got this as a tablet I would feel ok to lose. It is better than expected.
1,"Lots of options. If you are a prime member, you have a great selection of movies."
1,Works great. Love the kid option. Easy to use. Power lasts longer than I thought.
1,Too much configuration in order to work as needed.
1,Small enough to carry and works fast enough for small jobs
1,great tablet for not a lot of money. would recommend.
1,Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
1,I love reading on my Paperwhite! The battery lasts for weeks and it is light enough to carry in my purse when I don't want to carry my other Kindle devices.
1,"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation"
0,"I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+."
1,"Nice product, great value. Perfect beginner tablet for my 7 year old!"
0,"It works well, it's the same as using the firestick to me just cost more."
1,"We like our Echo, but maybe slightly pricey. It's a great speaker; easy to set-up & connects to you phone."
1,I don't like reading too many physical books because it's a bit bothersome to lug around the heavy volumes. Having everything in this device is great since it's E-Ink and lit
1,"Quick answers, cooking conversions, jokes, shopping lists, uber calls, weather, it does everything"
1,"Awesome system, easy to use, love it! Waiting for the next system to upgrade on my room."
1,"Received this for a Christmas gift. Great for listening to music and works with our Nest thermostat. Echo is in our main area and dot is in our bedroom, kids like dot to take downstairs and listen to music. Looking forward to adding lighting to our home so Echo can control it. Have had fun asking Alexa questions too!"
1,"I love this tablet, I can take pictures and videos."
1,"This little tablet is excellent for what it is. I have a Prime account, so there are many features available on this advice with that membership.We mostly use this to stream music in our lounge, and it works well for that purpose."
1,The Amazon Echo does & is doing what it's supposed too. Works great
0,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
1,Great product and holds a lot of memory. Sometimes it is hard to get a movie started.
1,"My son loves it, reads every day now. I love the fact, there is no internet/games to destruct him from reading. Small size allows to take it everywhere, wonderful screen for eyes. Just perfect!"
1,"Purchased to supplement my 4k Tivo & older Apple Tv - very pleased with channels and processor speed ! Attached to 4k 50"" Vizio - Sharp output when connected to 4k HDMI input on Vizio."
1,Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books.
1,"I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
1,My children love the tablet. It's a good price and the apps that come with it are great.
1,"Purchased this is a gift for a 7 year old and 13 year old. They both love the tab. They can play their games, surf the web and most importantly, read books!!! For the price you can't beat this tablet. Well done Amazon."
1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J2G4VBG/refcmcrrypprdttlsol4
1,"Great impulse purchase, have enjoyed setting this up as my first smart home device and linking all the other systems through it. Easy to set up and easy to set up with my smart home devices. It's be one of the most enjoyable devices having here at the house. Nice to be able to control different things around the house by just using my voice."
1,"Wife is happy. As they say happy wife, happy life."
1,I have had each of the models released and this current one with the 300 ppi is the best so far. Reading screen is excellent. Fonts are crisp and clear.
1,"This tablet is pretty cool, and reasonably priced. Easy enough for kids to use and I would recommend for those interested in buying one that don't wanna spend a lot."
1,I bought 3 of these to use for tutoring kids at church. The program is just getting started but I think they will work great as a tool to help these kids. We will have some basic reading apps and educational games.
1,"This is an excellent product to give as a gift, one of the most reliable brands in the market."
1,we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell
1,I'm loving it. I've got it for 2 months now and im very happy with it. It feels very fast and reliable. Also the interface feels very friendly and easy to use.
1,"Best purchase I've made in a while. This thing is fun for the whole family, really came in handy with the recent storms we had. Every night is a movie night with this"
1,"Great selection of apps, books, overall everything, daughter loves it!"
1,Wonderful product. Very happy to be cable free! Highly recommend!
1,Has a faster processor than the firestick and has the ability for expandable memory. Works great.
1,"Between listening to whatever song we want to telling my kids a short bedtime story with their name in it, we love it! Trivia crack is fun to play too."
1,our granddaughter loves to read and my wife has one also so we thought this would be a perfect gift for her.
1,Great tablet got the money plenty of features and easy to use and big enough to ser
1,Bought these for my classroom on Black Friday. The great deal was what motivated the purchase but I'm thrilled with them even if they had been more. Can connect to the internet so students can use apps easily. Makes learning fun!
1,She doesn't always understands me but I still like it
1,Decent.......................................................................
1,"My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
1,"I bought 3 of these for my kids. the parental controls are good, lacking in some areas but overall what I was looking for. a way to limit what they can do and I control what is on the tablet not them. and I can see their web history etc."
1,Price was just right.i would recommend to someone.
1,I had no idea that Alexa would tell me jokes and play games with me! I'm still in the process of discovering all of the things my device is capable of. My only disappointment is that I get a lot of I don't know answers to questions that I expected it to be able to answer. Or maybe I'm not asking right??
1,So far I am loving this still learning all the in and out
1,I love the Echo. Would recommend this to everyone. It is very fun and knowledgeable
1,limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
1,I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
1,The Echo is so much fun! There is so much you can do with it!
1,"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse"
1,I love having a Kindle. There is no glare and your eyes are not tired after reading for a long time. My only thing is that Selecting and highlighting on the touch screen could be more smoother.
1,My Nephew and mom loved their tablets! He is 6 and takes it everywhere. Easy to set up and use
1,My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
1,My 3yr. old loves this tablet. Easy for her to use. She watches videos plays games.
1,"For the price, these are perfect for young or old. Compared to other brands these are comparable if not better!!!"
1,"I like the tablet. The only negative is that google apps don't work, but for the money, I don't really care that much. I mostly just use it to read"
1,This is a really good tablet for young kids to play on.
1,I bought this for my eight year old to use in the car. It works well for him.
1,"It is a great voice control device that help daily life around the house. The mic pickup is very sensitive ND can pickup my commands from across the room with TV on. It retrieve s all kind of information such as nrws, weather etc. Great music player. Love it!!"
1,I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
1,"The Echo is the coolest thing! I love it. I even got one for my son, and he listens to music as he falls asleep at night. It's awesome. Buy one!"
1,"first Android tablet I have owned and I liked enough to taste the android marketplace and OS. Runs smooth and snappy display. All the Amazon apps, plus you can download the Google Play Store and have a choice between the two. Overall, definitely worth the money and neat media player if nothing else. And can't beat it for the money spent"
1,"We love our little NSC plant, she is very helpful and I know she is excellent at keeping the proper authorities informed with the happenings in our humble abode."
1,Very satisfied with this product ! Works great! Does all I need
1,Love it more then a fire stick. Not as much lag and runs so much faster
1,I prefer this kindle to the first one I purchased. I like that it's similar to a computer and I can see the colors and it's not monochromatic. its lightweight which is great also.
1,The kindle paper white provides an excellent reading experience .
1,This has all I need and want. Great storage and speed.
1,Excellent tablet for the price! I use it as a reader and to surf the web.
0,"You can not block Bing and it shows ""trending now"" News content. This can not be deleted or blocked. It also types ahead and adds content."
1,Great for my kids. Syncs to all of our Amazon videos and netflix. The protective kids case is a must. Makes it easier for smaller kids to hold without touching the screen. Also does well with drops to the ground
1,Have been doing exactly what it's intended to and only wish it more intuitive
1,"The Voyage is clear, doesn't strain your eyes, and I have had no problems using it. Recommended!"
1,"Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!"
1,"No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem"
1,Great to read books and it do almost everything a table will do
1,"If, like I, you own an earlier generation Kindle that isn't a Paperwhite, this latest model is WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE.If you don't, it's like having a wider but really no thicker or heavier iPhone 6 Plus to read your Kindle app books (and to use Goodreads) on outdoors. (It even has Airplane Mode.)It had me at its crisp, crisp backlit display and quick response to touch. (I had to really press vs. tap on the older Kindle, and it was so slow to take/load.)"
1,Alexa is a lot of fun to have in the kitchen. It's a great device to connect to the latest news or ingredients for a recipe! Highly recommend.
0,Nice tab for young kids getting use to using Tabs. Fully functional and fairly easy to use.
1,"Super fast and easy to use. Great device, able to do much more than before."
1,"I got the Amazon Echo and the Dot to supplement it. Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't. It depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are (ie. television or stereo on or even if the Echo is playing loud music itself). So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo. Nothing personal but it doesn't make sense since there's a box to enter the ""name"". So for now, ""she's"" Alexa."
1,This is the echo you can take anywhere. Runs on battery and can connect via bluetooth when away from wifi.
1,"Have you ever had a device that actually changed your life? This is one of those devices. It's absolute genius. Echo is for you if you use Amazon Prime and have WiFi in your house. Tell it what music you want to listen to. Ask it how many teaspoons are in a 1/4 cup. Tell it what groceries you need. Tell it to turn on the lights, TV or anything you want with the addition of smart plugs. All in all, it's as close to flawless of any new technology I've ever had. Echo is worth every nickel."
1,"i bought this for my little one . Finally ,world become quiet."
1,This was a Christmas gift for my son. He has been wanting one for a while and this was some of the best pricing I've seen
1,We are enjoying it so far. We really like the fact that you can play games one it. I would definitely recommend.
1,bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!!
1,I bought three of these for my kids ages 7 to 14 and it works great for what they use them for. My only wish is that it came with Google Play Store but we were able to install that separately and works well.
1,I would highly recommend purchasing Alexa! Make sure to get all of the updates that she is capable of. for example you can do sleep sounds. She will even tell you the weather Sports excetera
1,"I really like the smaller size reader, and being left handed the ease of use of the haptic page turn buttons are very easy to use. I don't even use the touch screen page advance any more, with the haptic advance this can be done from the right or left side of the reader, an advantagefor us lefties. This is my fourth kindle, I keep upgrading due to all the changes and advances, I use my kindle every night and enjoy it very much and would highly recommend if you want to upgrade to the voyage, visit your local best buy and hold it in your hands and feel and see the difference."
1,"Looks good, works great and light enough to carry in your pocket. would be much better if it would a compaters (nook) APP."
1,Can't go wrong at 40 to 50 bucks.I also have the 8 inch and prefer the 7 in the hand.I bought the eight for the extra ram 2gb instead of 1 but haven't seen any differences in the 7 or 8 while using it
1,my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.
1,"Don't let the low price and screen size fool you. This 7"" tablet is a bargain at $50 and works flawlessly. It has long battery life and a bright display. I find myself using it most often to view movies on Amazon Prime, which can be flung to my flat screen TV instantly. This is a must-have item for $50."
1,I finally cut the cord since my AT&T Uverse was getting really expensive. It works great with Sling TV and you can easily search through all your apps using the voice search. I should have cut the cord sooner.
1,"i brought this to my daugther and she loves it, she can go on netflix, amazon music and youtube easily, good display pretty good volume"
1,It's definitely not a top of the line tablet but great for the price the kids love it
1,"Unbelievably good value when I bought one at a discounted sale price, but well worth the usual Best Buy price of USD$50. Simplicity itself, particularly if you have used Android previously. Although restricted to the Amazon environment and App store, I still found all the free apps I could ever need, and the tablet appears to be very reliable compared to my aging nexus."
1,The best part is it keeps learning. I use it a lot for my hue lights and separate radio from my Sonos
1,We have a lot of technology in our house. This is one great way to streamline and simplify the systems.
1,"So far we use it for entertainment and it has not disappointed! We have found every genre of music and many obscure musicians with it. Have some privacy concerns, but overall for music and jokes, it is fun! My wife has discovered new songs, due to an occasional misinterpretation, but always fun enjoy. Great for waking us up also!"
1,Enjoying my Alexas! We have multiple Alexa's and dots around the house and garage!!
1,best servives grate people and good prises im very happy
1,"I am a hardcore HARDBACK book reader - it's always my preference. I always said I liked the ""feel & size"" of a ""real"" book over any electronic book reader. Boy was I wrong. I bought my Kindle on a whim while it was on sale, and I absolutely love it - I never imagined how much MORE I would read on the Kindle - I have gone through book after book after book, while a hardback still sits waiting on my nightstand to finish. It's a great size - throw it in my purse and read anywhere. The light is nice for darker reading situations. One of the best features in my opinion is borrowing books. You can borrow one book a month free through Amazon's Kindle Lending Library -- but you can borrow as many as your want from your local library (if it participates). That is where most of my reading has come from. I love the Kindle more than I ever imagined and recommend to any reader, especially those, like me, who swore on hardback ""real"" books!"
1,"Great reader, perfect size and weight, fantastic battery life."
1,Amazing device. I have found so much that can be done without picking up my phone. Love it. You you will be happy you purchased it.
1,This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
1,"It is very convenient while working out, traveling and stuff. The mic is at the right location and it is good to answer calls as well. I have connected it to my iPhone and use it to listen to music and take calls. The best part is even if you don't want to plug it in your ears, you can leave it hanging around your neck!"
1,"I bought it as a gift for my grandfather, from what I can tell he really seems to enjoy it."
1,"I use my Fire to read, play games, browse, view Facebook, and much more. Great product for the price!"
1,great product Amazon does a real good job giving you big bang for your buck the tablet is rapid and battery life is good
1,This was a gift for my grandfather's 80th birthday. He was amazed that Alexa could play his favorite songs.
1,"Great tablet. Love reading my books, playing puzzles, and going on basic social apps."
1,reception and wi fi interface is outstanding much better than roku
1,Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
0,I love my device but wish there was more of a descriptive summary of how to get music stations and as well as other features. I've learned most by just coming upon things. Needs better operating instructions
1,I love this kindle and its screen which is good for low light reading and also in sunlight.
1,"fire TV works much better than Fire stick. The connection is more stable, the only problem is that the box seeems to go to sleep and does not recognise the remote. it starts working in a few seconds. it is just annoying"
0,This tablet offers the user more options than a regular tablet but the ease of use a beginner would love
1,"Seriously ... nothing more addictive. Add skills to your hearts content. Start your day with your briefing, review your calendar, set timers, etc ... yep, no wonder it was this year's Elmo for adults!"
1,Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children's
1,Great ereader. Best bang for your buck. I highly recommend this product.
1,"Excellent tablet for the low price, insurance however would be a waste of money since its 1/3 the cost of the tablet"
1,I had the kindle keyboard before and got the paper white for Christmas and really like. I can read I any light I no longer have to have a light attached to my kindle to read before bed. Pretty simple to use.
1,"Received a Kindle Fire as a gift about 10 years ago. Finally went to Kindle heaven. Bought myself a new Kindle Fire HD 10, Geek Squad in store helped me set it up and transfer all my information from old one to new one. I love it and the service was awesome."
1,"Love my Alexa! I love all kinds of music and I can get it with Alexa! If your stumped on a question, just ask her. She know the temp. where you are and weather. It's amazing the sound that comes out of this little tube! The music sound is awesome!"
1,"Setup my New Echo and had it become a new active family member in a few moments ! Very coo and very conversational ! New , Weather traffic reports .. does it all !!!"
1,"I love how you can play Spotify, Audible and set alarms and sleep timers at the sound of your voice. The Echo does a great job understanding what I am saying as well. Great purchase!"
1,"I have really enjoyed this device. It works very well. Only thing I was disappointed with was that when I bought it the cashier at Best Buy said if I found it cheaper in another store, or online that would give me the difference in the money. I did find it cheaper online but the manager refused to give me the difference of $15. I suggested they not tell customers they would honor a cheaper price when they won't really do it."
1,I purchased 3 of these for Christmas gifts for my son and 2 granddaughters. I purchased 2 different colors for the girls so they wouldn't fight and one for my son to replace a broken tablet. They all love them.
1,I like the paperwhite as it was very easy to read while sitting on the beach in bright sunlight
1,It's great for news flash and playing music. It's not great on world news. I tried to buy one for my sister in Canada. Why does Amazon not allow this work in Canada. .
1,"Like it very well so far, easy setup and streaming works great."
1,I just love my new Kindle paperwhite.
0,Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.
1,the best and fun speaker i love the way you can find news and music
1,"I found this cover to be quite handsome in appearance (EVERYONE who sees it comments on how cool or how nice it is!), very simple, and very functional. It's VERY easy to attach the Kindle DX to it and the fit is perfect. Most importantly, it appears Amazon has solved the older problem with this cover somehow damaging the Kindle if one opened the cover from the back too far. Now, there is a small magnet embedded in the back of the cover that gently keeps the back cover snug to the Kindle DX and serves to gently remind you, with a gentle tug, if you accidentally attempt to open your Kindle backwards. For me, it's an elegant and well-thought-out solution."
1,I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.
1,I had bought this tablet for my sister who is wheel chair bound or she lays in her bed. She gets a lot of Joy from using the tablet.Its big screen helps her see things better.
1,This was a great purchase. Bought for my son for his birthday and the whole family loves it!
1,Grandkids love it now they have their own personal tablets and I love that it has parental control
1,does everything and more...very easy to operate and set up...
1,Easy to use and great parental controls to limit or access content.
1,Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
1,It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends
1,Such a great purchase! It's way better than I had anticipated! Wish I would have bought one sooner
1,"We use this to run Kodi. It works perfectly. Far better than the Fire Stick, which we also have."
1,My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
1,"Alexa is very easy to use. I just plugged it in, downloaded the companion app, and was surprised how much it could do with a few voice commands. I highly recommend it for beginners in home automation devices. The more I use it, the more intuitive​ it becomes. I am going to purchase one for my 86 yr old mother too."
0,We got one of these for my mother in law. She mostly plays games and looks at things online. The tablet is good for a minimal browsing and games...not for expert use.
1,I love it it is so easy to use it and I can safely everything I want.
1,I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.
1,The echo is very cool. The voice commands take a little practice but the options are fantastic. Totally recommend.
0,This thing is ok. Next time we get electronics it will be Amason
1,We got this for the yankee swap and it was extremely popular. The person that picked it up was very happy.
1,"I purchased this tablet for my father for the sole purpose of playing games, checking email and anything else would be very basic. He is getting chemo so has long days and often stays home so for someone not technically inclined and a beginner with tablets he loves it!!"
1,"We bought these for my wife's room since she's a teacher. She needed tablets that were not too expensive, but would still work and not be frustrating. The only thing we couldn't get to work was the time limiter on them. Overall, great purchase for her class room."
1,"I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
1,"Great item, did away with cable. I need to purchase 4 more."
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and she loves it.
1,Love it. Best charger I ever bought. Quickly charges my Kindle and my cell phone.
1,I'm in LOVE with ALEXA!!
1,Works great!
1,These are really cool I got them for my parents and they really enjoy them.
1,Good small affordable tablet gets the job done very nice.
1,Christmas gift for my wife who has regular Kindle and an Ipad mini.This has become her goto medium for ebooks.
1,"Yes it is heavy, bulky and the adds are annoying but for the price it is a great little tablet."
1,Did exactly what I wanted it to do and more. Love it!!
0,"Hopefully, this will at least work as an e-reader. Otherwise, Amazon has it locked up so tight one cannot do much else with it. And, even with my fiber optic Wi-Fi it is slower than cold molasses in January in Canada. Well, I needed a Kindle e-reader and for $40 that is ok."
1,"I highly recommend this tablet, it is very affordable!"
1,amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
0,I thought I'd love this but felt like it had very little purpose. Did like it at all.
1,I recommend this product and Best Buy to friends and family members
1,Good size with very good weight. You will love the gentle backlight if u read in a dark area. Best buy was one that had it as same price as Amazon. Just excellent!
1,I'VE had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low I knew I wanted to purchase another one. It can be used for a variety of uses.
1,4K Netflix streaming is awesome. Tons of available apps. Remote works well. Gets kinda hot after a while but doesn't seem to be affecting performance. Would recommend!
1,First off this is cheaper than the Apple TV and it's better 10 fold and also it's able to play 4K format if you have a 4K tv it's got a sd card slot and you can plug a PS4 control through the USB it also has and use the PS4 remote to control the device and play the amazon games 2 it's awesome period buy it!!!!!!
1,He loves it.. Internet faster and has a lot of space I would recommend price great!!
1,"I don't know why I waited so long to purchase one!! I like that I can check out books from the library, and don't have to worry about not getting them returned late."
1,The amazon fire tv stick is awesome. Watch all your streaming videos with no problems.
1,We first purchased the stick and worked great but we wanted something more powerful. This allowed us to connect directly to our router and got great connection. No more pauses or buffering. I would buy again if I needed to.
1,"I'm not normally a techie person, but I read so many positive things about Amazon's Echo and Alexa, I splurged and gave it a try. I absolutely love it! Of course asking questions about traffic, weather, recipes, etc. can be a blast, but I have to admit that my favorite part is being able to request any type of music I'm in the mood for, and even change my mind a few minutes later, without having to sort through CD's or putz around with the various 'plays' or radio stations on my phone or laptop. Definitely a gadget worth the money!!"
1,My son loves it. Very easy to use. Great price and value.
1,"Love the echo hear music , ask for news updates. Get directions for anywhere I want to go ."
1,"I purchased this for my fianc. She reads books with it,surfs the web, and watches Netflix on it. Very easy set up and easy to use. It also comes in different colors."
1,It is good. I liked it. It is the best the very best how how I love it.
1,Purchased this over the holidays and have enjoyed it since. The look and feel of a book is great.
1,Great way to watch movies. Able to store pictures. Haven't had much time to explore to much
1,Xmas presents for grandkids they play games and they take lots of pictures . Good purchase .
1,Amazon always make a great product. Long lasting device that never over heats or cuts off while in use.
1,"Alexa is not only fun to ask questions to, but she also tells jokes, weather, news, TV programs, how to spell a word, sports updates and any thing else you can think of. She is a hands free google. You can even have her send flowers for you. More and more aps are coming available. I love listening to either Pandora or Iheart radio, the sound quality is very good. We also have our lamp hooked up so she can turn this off and on when you tell her to."
1,"I have several Fire tv boxes and they all very good for streaming Amazon, Netflix and others. If you have a 4k tv this box will delight you with the ability to stream 4k content.Great buy!!!"
1,Very happy... excited to continue to learn more about what Echo can do
1,Works as annticapated. Would recommend. Might buy another one. This survey is not working right.???????????
1,"Very user friendly, perfect for my daughter's school research and books. She is very happy"
1,I actually bought this for my son and he loves it!!
1,Great for educational apps for kids; user friendly
1,Bought two for gifts. A huge hit!! They are readers and love not having to lug books.
1,Firebox is the best streaming device of all of them. Excellent product. Best App capabilities. Easy to use.
1,"I have several Amazon Kindles already. This was a nice, reasonable cost tablet for my little one. I have been quite happy with the Kindle devices."
1,"Speaker quality is better than expected, works well in the living room, convenient addition"
1,"Alexa has been around awhile so it does what you would expect it to do. I was slightly less impressed with it only because I wasn't an amazon prime member, which limits is productivity. If you want a full experience with Alexa, you have to be a prime member. Since I mostly use google products already, it made sense for me to get the Home - which to me is a little bit more functional than Alexa only due to the Google search engine.Overall, if you're in the market for such a connected device, you can't go wrong with either"
1,"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well."
0,Got this for my kids for Christmas. Price was nice and no problems so far.
1,I Bought Two Of The Amazon Fire Tablets For My 6 & 8 Year Old And I've Had No Problems With Them. They Don't Have Some Of The Games That You Can Download On An Android Market But Other Then That The Tablets Overall Are Great Especially For Kids Sense They Have a Child's Browsing & Adult Browsing With Parental Locks.
1,Great for kids and adults !easy to use and carry around
1,Great tablet for the kids they can use it for games.
1,Got it for my grandson he loves it.it is a very good tablet!!!
1,"Kindle makes reading easy, lightweight and the light makes reading much easier in low or no light."
1,"I bought for my sister's birthday she really enjoyed it, it is very appropriate and fits her"
1,Simple to set up. Simple to use. Great display with a quick system to back it up.
1,Great value with a lot of capabilities and available aps. This was purchased to be my 13 yr olds first 'grown up' computer of her own. She is very satisfied.
1,Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.
1,The fire stick provides excellent 4k quality and is easy to use
1,"I had an original Kindle DX and a Kindle keyboard. I decided to upgrade and get the Paperwhite and I'm glad I did. The light is great for reading where it isn't very bright. The e-ink is great for reading outdoors or anywhere. It's easier on the eyes than reading on my Ipad. I still read physical books too, but the Paperwhite is great for traveling and just tucking in my purse to take everywhere. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."
1,The Fire Tablets are by far the best value on the market. They are parent friendly with the parental controls and kid friendly with he ease of use.
1,I bought this unit for my daughter who loves to read but sometimes get frustrated by the size format of paper books and the weight of traditional tablets. The e-ink is super easy to read and the unit weighs next to nothing. A bit spendy for something you can only use to read on but so so nice to use.
0,I purchased this for my stepdaughter. well her dad and I are no longer together we divorced 2 yrs ago. Both her parents could not purchase this for her. So Merry Christmas little one. She loves it . Easy to learn great for pictures
1,We bought this for our son and he loves it. He can read his books and also play games on it.
1,This device is easy to install and great for a beginner!
0,"Not bad,but returned it and bought a dot to go with my soundtouch 20. Would recommend this if your not fussy about your music."
1,"I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He knows how to work everything."
1,I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.
1,I've had a kindle fire for over 4 years so I decided to get this one for my daughter and she is going to love it. They're very durable and will meet the needs that she has.
1,"I had ordered the Echo and from what I had read I did not think I would need the Remote. The Echo works great if you are in the same Room. I like to listen to Music while I am cooking, cleaning, or doing nothing. I always had to go back in the same room to where my Echo was to change or skip to the next Song if I wanted. With the Remote I can change it from any room. I just stick it in my Pocket and take it out when I want to switch, turn it down or up. Connects through Blue Tooth very quickly. Has a magnetic holder to keep the Remote on (mine is on my Desk Leg) to keep it when not in use. There is a Felt Pad on the back of the Magnetic Holder so that it will not scratch any surface that it is attached to. I love it!"
1,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass."
1,"Purchased this tablet for my 8yr old son, he loves it."
1,"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach."
1,This was a excellent gift for someone who likes to read alot.
1,Great for grandkids. Have times they can go on. I have 4 of them.
1,"I am amazed at this little tablet! I had, and still have, a Kindle Paper White for 3 years before I dared to try to use it, and after using it I was intrigued by the possibilities.... I joined a public library and began reading books for free. When I had trouble downloading some books because they were EPUB instead of KINDLE, I decided to look into the FIRE. This FIRE cost me $39! Amazing. I don't use a SMART PHONE and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where I drag my laptop like a hotel or at Starbucks. This little number allows me a lot of flexibility. Besides downloading books, I can go online, I can download music from my AMAZON PRIME account for free (music that I don't want to pay for to get onto my IPOD CLASSIC). I can hook up the FIRE to my BOSE speakers and the sound is great! I already watched a PBS TV show on the FIRE while waiting to get an oil-change done on my car at the dealership. I added 64 gigs of memory for about $20, thinking that I might build quite a music library on this little machine. Since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deep-sixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, I think! I have almost figured out how to get the music from the FIRE onto my MAC...but maybe it can't be done ... I don't know. AMAZON doesn't let you download from the PRIME music library to a computer...they only allow the download to tablets and phones. But there must be a way around this...I think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. On the downside, I hate the fact that the screen is not an anti-glare screen to begin with, but I bought something which I think will solve that problem. Don't like the fingerprints ... I'm trying to get used to the notion of a touch-screen. I'm OLD...I don't like change...so adapting is not that easy. But I'm working on it and I would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories I purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. I'm having a lot of fun with it! The tablet DOES subject one to advertising when you open it...but I ignore it. I ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do...it's a well-ingrained habit. If I were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then I would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. But for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, I guess. I'm an APPLE person so I felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! LOL. I SAID I was old...don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. Thing is you CAN figure it out. I don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. But I only learn by trial and error. Have fun! Buy the thing...it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! The screen adjustments for reading are good...font size, background color, etc. I needed to have something that was easy on the eyes...this works for me!"
1,I've owned one of the original Kindle for years and love it. In fact I handed it down to my daughter. I just thought it would be nice to own the newest version with the built-in light. The other thing I considered was the weight. I love my new Kindle as much as I have loved my old one.
0,Affordable tablet for kids to use. Great deal!!!!!!
1,"Great for reading books and digital comics and the perfect entry-level tablet for Amazon's grand ecosystem. If you like this, you can upgrade in the future to something with more storage and power."
1,Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.
1,I absolutely love my new kindle tablet!! I love the size and feel of it. It has auto blue shade. I can set it for what time I want it to dim.
1,This a great tablet for a child. Fully functional Amazon fire tablet with a special GUI just for the little ones . Plus a 2 year warranty no matter what happens to it. Definitely worth it!
1,"Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard."
1,We are getting this as a christmas gift. I am so excited for out 7 year old to open it
1,This is my second Amazon Fire TV. This is the newest version and the picture is quite a bit better thatn the first one. Viewing Playstation Vue it works flawlessly at 60 fps. So simple to hook up and use. Amazon had all my apps loaded as soon as I logged in. Love this product!
0,"I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price."
1,"Alexa is so amazing, this is a wonderful new member of our family .she is so smart and constantly updates her self. Now I would be lost without her."
1,Much better than the first generation Amazon Fire TV. Very fast and reliable.
1,"I was a long time apple tv user but recently cut ties with the cable company and got sling and didn't want to shell out more for another apple tv. I have had my Fire TV for a few weeks now and love it, I haven't really used the voice controls that often but it works great. I would definitely recommend it especially if you are using Kodi."
1,Great if sharing between kids. You can set up a timeframe for each of how long they should be on it
1,"Absolutely love the Amazon Echo! I work from my home office quite often and have my Echo sitting on the desk next to me. From playing music, searching for a number or address, checking the weather or asking a quick question... it's like having a co-worker/personal assistant by my side. The big difference is I can get what I need quickly and eliminate the need for unproductive small talk."
1,"This device is great to stream a variety of content. It does not buffer like the stick since it plugs into the Ethernet on the router. I would recommend for your ""streaming"" needs."
1,"My primary reason for purchasing this was to control my new smart home devices. In particular, our Phillips Hue lights. Works great for off/on and dimming at a percentage but can't get the colors and scenes to work. Has to be SO exact with the naming of the lights and wording when you speak to Alexa. Also, making lists is JUST a shopping list. It would be great if I could add to an Amazon wish list instead! Seems like a natural!? Great for checking weather, sports and such. Playing music is hit or miss with my Prime account... to REALLy get everything, you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled ""unlimited"" feature. Example: I can listen to the Police or Foo Fighters, but no Led Zeppelin - really??? Then it just tries to ""sell you"" the upgrade when you ask it to play something it can't. That's pretty annoying. Looking forward to Apple's version of this. More expensive and still many months away, but since I have an Apple Music account and it will play MY playlists! The Alex Echo was a great price though and a good starting home hub speaker."
1,"Got this for a replacement for original Kindle Fire works better than the older one, can take pics front & back, also accepts memory card."
1,"Although I've always wished I read more, I never would find the time to get to it. Having the Kindle made it so practical to own and read books, especially at night time, now that I don't have to keep the lights on and bother my partner.A must-have for anyone, those who read regularly and those who are interested in reading more."
1,Love the Echo!! Love that it's all voice command even the vloume!
1,"Quite satisfied overall with the fire tablet. For the price I ended up getting it for, there's no arguement. It's got everything I could ask for, I'd recommend it."
1,It does exactly what I bought it for and more. Worth every penny
1,I thought the size was a little small bit besides that it's nice and battery is good
1,This box is very easy to program and to use. We can access all types of TV programs and movies. The voice command is very cool and save a great deal of time not havei g to type every thing you're searching for. Love It!!
1,"Had a first generation Nook, this was way more than I was expecting. Plus the Prime membership is worth it just for shipping !"
1,"Bought this primarily to use as an e-reader. Got it on Cyber Monday so it was a pretty good deal. I live in the Google ecosystem so I loaded it with the google apps after buying it. I pretty much ignore all the amazon stuff. If I want to use the internet I either use wi-fi or access it via using my phone as a hotspot. It is a decent size for reading, although I think I would have been better off with 16 gigs instead of 8 for storage. I have installed a 32gb micro sd card for extra storage."
1,I was looking for a tablet that I could carry in my purse. This Kindle Fire is perfect. I pair it with my hotspot and I'm online in a jiffy. Saves my phone data. I love it.
1,Excellent product. Zipper than the Fire Stick. Attractive design.
1,Great price and cool gadget. Bigger then my phone which makes it easier to read eBooks.
1,"Excellent Product excellent price ,nice and easy to use thanks"
1,"I'll admit it -- I'm kinda lazy. But this thing is so much fun AND feeds my laziness! Easy set up, does all SORTS of fun things....My favorite is being able to wake up in the middle of the night and say ""Alexa, add orange juice to my shopping list"" and go right back to sleep."
1,Good and performance is also good worth the money spent
1,This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera.
1,"This tablet is a great value. Tablets in this price range usually end up failing quickly, but this tablet has held up perfectly for almost a year now. The 8GB is somewhat small, but adding an SD card has helped with storage. The lack of Google Play is a nuisance as the app selection is more limited, but by adding Aptoide, I was able to access many of the apps that are available in the Play store, but not Amazon."
1,"Purchased this for my Mom who had never had a tablet/smartphone, etc. She was able to figure it out quickly and the price was right. Works great for her."
1,"I like this product, particular the translation function that makes reading much smooth."
0,"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product"
1,"It's great to watch all your Movies , and stream ."
1,"The Amazon echo is a great way to ease into the Home automation field. While the Echo works great for playing music and getting the weather or sports news, it does take a bit ow work to connect it to ""smart"" devices.My home had a NEST thermostat, and could not get the echo to connect. I spent time searching the web, followed a the steps in a couple YouTube videos, and still could not make the connection. I stumbled across the IFFFT(?) website, which was the solution I chose to link the two devices."
1,this is a great item!!! is not just smart is so easy to work and do small thing for you!!!!
1,"I like the Echo a lot. Mostly because of voice automation with Alexa. I've had my Echo Dot (from Best Buy too) since last November (about eight or nine months) and I like it for my bedroom, but the added speaker on the larger Echo device is much better for listening to news or music. If you turn on the ""start of request"" sound though, it's not as loud as the one on the Echo Dot, which is both good and bad. Either way, I like this device, and I'm glad I got it for only $100 with the added protection plan."
1,Highly recommended. Comfortable to hold while reading
1,"I bought this to be an assistant for my husband who is in the earlier stages of Alzheimers Dementia. He is able to ask about his schedule, get reminders to take his medicine, and get basic information like time and date. He also requests weather forecasts. Alexa always answers with a pleasant voice no matter how many times the question is asked."
1,"Each of my three kids got this for Christmas ages 10,8,7. They all use for various reasons. The deal we made was you have a to read a book a week unless it is really long. The kids have used it to read but play games as well. A nice gift for forty bucks"
1,"Very good reader! Bought on sale, excellent value!"
1,I absolutely love Alexa! It was so easy to set up and its incredibly easy to use!!
1,Great for kids to watch video and games. Love it...
1,"On sale for my 3 year old and he loves it, mostly used for movies and games."
1,I like to hear the news flash plus my tunes. The kids have fun with it too
1,"I've had one of these but gave it to my niece. I thought I'd be OK without it but when I saw this deal, I had to go get it!"
1,"I bought this for my 13 yr old child for Christmas. She uses it to download and read books (saves lots of space on the book shelf) and she browses the internet, and watches Amazon prime movies. So far it has been a great device and for the price, it has been an amazing deal!"
1,My son told me about this product and spoke highly so we purchased for grandchild. Very satisfied.
1,I've been back and forth about what Kindle to purchase next. I'm so glad I chose the Fire 7.
1,"Really fun and nifty device...we use it for setting alarms, checking movies, weather info, playing music and getting answers. We are evolving with it to discover new ways to utilize the Echo. Speaker quality is very good...better than I expected."
1,My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
0,"can't connect to any router, hot spot. Returned and so did the sales clerk with theirs. enough said..."
1,"For the same price as the Roku 3, you can get the Amazon Fire TV box. Why would you want this? 1. It runs Android2. You can install Android Apps (via sideload)3. It's Extensible. Because of items 1 and 2, you can really make this any kind of device you want. Most Android apps should work on this, and of course, you have access to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc."
1,"No problems here, although it's such a simple and common product that it seems a little pricey. Works well with charger for Kindle."
1,Great display and colors easy to use. Very good entry level tab great price seems to be very durable great apps. Would recommend to anyone wanting entry level tablet.
1,Bought one a few months ago and after our conventional kindle died replaced it with the fire and it is amazing! Bought them for my kids for the holidays!
0,This tablet is ok for a kid. I was expecting more because it's a Fire brand.
1,"I was hesitant to buy this because I was not sure how I was going to use it. I now use it everyday! I listen to music, ask questions, check the weather, sports scores and more. It is the greatest think ever! I am just sorry I waited so long to get one."
1,The Echo is very entertaining and informative. It is an excellent speaker too.
1,I bought this as a gift for my grandkids. They absolutely love it!
1,Great option for my office to make use of my Amazon Prime membership. Better if it had a browser but the voice option Alexa is wonderful. Search app option is welcomed. I may add the game controller soon.
1,"I'm an avid android user, however you'd be very hard pressed to find an android tablet of this quality in this price range. The quality of this Amazon Fire tablet is really great. It is not HD, but that doesn't matter to my 9 year old, who uses it to play games and listen to music. It has extremely robust parental controls, allowing parents to set a child profile and then set screen time limits, bedtimes, and limit content available. The child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion, as I think my 9 year old could handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon content and kiddie games only. Overall I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Works well
1,"The ultra UD, the easy user interface, well designed remote and the ability to add third party apps makes this a must have!!"
1,Seems smaller than the older version but it still does the job. User friendly.
1,"Can't wait to use my new echo, heard such great things about Alexa."
1,"Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well. Don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. He understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day."
1,"My kid love it, especially the sd card slot.Tgey can watch there favorite movies on the microsd."
1,Wonderful e-reader. I love my Amazon Fire. I travel a lot and I do not leave home without it!
1,I am happy to report that the kids are happy with their gifts.
1,"This version has some advantages and upgrades compared to the previous version, but it is missing the optical audio out. Outside of that the device works fine, just not a fan of Amazon's version of Android. Still a good deal for what it is."
1,This new Kindle is very well built. Finally amazon got away from making the Kindles use a carousel to browse through apps. The speakers are of great quality and are very loud. This kindle is also extremely durable compared to nearly every tablet on the market. I've dropped this about 5 times already on my tile floor and there is virtually no damage.
1,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a portable device like this. It is well worth the price.
1,Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
1,Got this for my mother in law as a christmas gift she loves it
1,This is a great centerpiece for your smart home. Has the ability to control so many devices with more abilities coming. Also has an impressive speaker for such a small device.
1,"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker — opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured — when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy."
1,great tablet. it's great for playing games and reading.
1,Great product. Able to connect a lot of different devices.
1,Nice little tablet and the price was perfect. Can take it anywhere
0,This is not a bad tablet for the price. I personally need a little more on high end side. The plastic look doesn't do it for me.It has a expandable Micro Sd Slot and decent battery life. I gifted it to the Mrs. and she loves it.
1,"Bought as a gift for Spousal Unit. I have a Kindle Fire 8, but she wanted one a little larger, so the Fire 10 is perfect. Bought a 128 gig mini card so she has plenty of space. She's a happy camper. Happy wife, happy life."
1,"This is installed in a sewing room in lieu of a cable box with a monthly fee. She uses it with prime movies and tv shows (best of all, I don't have to watch)I did set it up and tried voice search. It works great>"
1,"Love this e-reader! Only complaint is the swipe to turn pages, wish it was an on screen button."
1,Perfect gift! Great apps and reading material. Would buy it again
1,This is the best!!! I'm in love with Alexa and everything she does!
1,Good speaker. I've learned to really like Alexa. She's more than a speaker. Lots of options. Carry it around for use on our outside decks.
1,"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
1,We got this as a gift for our 2 and 5 year old. Love the parental control feature and it is fairly easy for the kids to navigate.
1,I purchased this for my two granddaughters they are 4 and 3 they use it to watch videos while in the car and for travelling..
1,"Alexa doesn't always know what you're talking about, but we love hearing her good morning quotes and anecdotes and the audio quality for listening to music is very nice - similar to a bose sound."
1,The Eco Alexa is an amazing piece of technology. Design is sleek and unnoticeable.
1,"I recently dropped my cable provider and i had been using the Amazon Firestick which works great. The Fire TV was on sale and, since we have 2 tvs, i bought it. Couldn't believe the beautiful picture on my Samsung tv. I subscribed to HBO, Amazon Prime, and Showtime so I dropped my monthly bill with Directv from $190 to $30 and i have a ton more content."
1,I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book
1,"I purchased this tablet to leave in the kitchen to use for pinterest recipes. It is perfect for that, and small enough to easily tuck away in a cabinet when not in use."
1,"You give an amazing 7” tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a nice interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I can’t imagine not buying these for your kids, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means.I f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value."
1,we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.
1,this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
1,Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
1,So easy to set up and use. Very handy to have in our home. We use way more often than we thought we would.
1,"impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate"
1,"I use this to access playstation vue, Netflix, Hulu, youtube, kodi and Amazon prime. This works great as a replacement for directv and it paid for itself the first month."
1,Fire tv is to Android users as to Apple TV to Apple users. It's fast and never has any issues streaming
1,"This device is pretty no-frills, but for a 7 year old boy, it works great and is awesome. It's sturdy, plays apps well, and I don't have to freak out every time he drops it. I'm sure it will break eventually (my son will find a way), but for $50, I'll take my chanes."
1,Very pleased experience installation and setup....
1,"I bought one, now my sister has one, my mom and three more family members. Easy to use and set up; I keep finding more uses for it. It is the center of my automated home and a good Bluetooth speaker, alarm clock and news reader!"
1,I would buy this product again; would also recommend it to friends and family.
1,This is the 3rd fire in my family. This one was for my mother in law. The other two are my wife and my kids. These are easy to use and work well with Amazon as you would expect. I would recommend them as a starter tablet. I have used both Apple and Galaxy tabs and this one fits in well.
1,I got this because I love to read. Lots of books on it. I really love the battery life on it. I can go a week with one charge on it. No complaints except now I got to find time to read all the books on it
0,It's great! The price is right. You can load lots of books and cloud is unlimited to keep your books
1,"This device is great for streaming videos reading books,and web searching, which is what I enjoy!"
1,Old charger was taking forever to charge the device so I went in to Best Buy and found this comparable charger and it works great!
1,This tablet is easy to use. It is also durable and the battery lasts a fair amount of time.
1,I just loved the tab and it is super cool for kids
1,Good tablet for cheap. Has a lot of functions that are useful
1,"I have Sonos. Speaker of echo is not that much better like sonos, but I can talk with Alexa all day. Must have product for single people."
1,I always buy these kindles for corporate giveaways. They're reasonably priced and are great quality.
1,Love what I got works perfect good for my son he loves it
1,Already own one and a dot. Bought this one as a gift for someone. They already love it.
1,Bought this for a 2 year old. She loves it! She's already got more things figured out on it than I do!. Good educational programs and some fun ones too!
1,"Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet."
1,It has more features than the old rca tablet she had & has more memory & battery power plus u can get free ebooks
1,So much information is put at your fingertips. I love the unit and I'm going to buy one for my grandson.
1,bought this for my wife's birthday and she loves everything about it!
1,"Great value tablet, can't beat it for the price. Only issue is it is locked to Amazon."
0,I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate
0,This is embarrassing. I purchased one game from amazon app store. The app crashed right away after I started it. I don't know how Amazon tested all these apps on their own device. But the experience is really bad.
1,Bought two of these for gifts for our parents. Very easy to use. Good size.
1,"We bought this last year on Black Friday for a Christmas gift for my dad. He's an avid book reader, and this was something he's always wanted, but would never buy for himself.It's nothing fancy and complicated, but in addition to reading books, you can surf the web and download apps.A year later and he's still thanking us for it."
1,It does everything any other tablet will do. You can't beat the price. The only bad thing is the camera it's as sharp and clear. The pictures come out kinda of dull. But other that great little tablet make sure you get more memory.
0,"This product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Dot."
1,It works great I love it. I used to have a firestick and this was an upgrade.
1,These made great christmas gifts for my family that isn't too tech savvy but they love them and use it frequently!
1,I got this tablet for my son at a great price. Plus it is more durable.
1,Everyone is able to use this. Even the 4 and 5 year old grand kids .
0,"I bought this to enjoy the comforts of a tablet. My use includes youtube, twitch and other channels that are similar in purpose. I would recommend this product for its own intended purposes which is a ereader at best. it does have its own android base functions but not the functions I enjoy from a regular tablet. Some regular app you might use on a daily may not be compatible with this unit to sum it up."
1,"This is the 4th kindle I've purchased, not because of issues but because everyone in my house wants one. This last one I purchased for my 3 year old. He is very happy he can play games like his older siblings on his own kindle now"
1,Alexa just needs to better understand the questions asked.
1,"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!"
1,Love that it integrates with products like Spotify and smart things. We use it on a daily basis.
0,"The Amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason, it needs to be because they have to keep replacing it. I had two that died within weeks and every single one has broken the screen."
1,"Fast and reliable, easy to use interface. Great price and fast service at Best Buy."
1,"I bought this item and have not been able to put the remote down. A great product that I would recommend for anyone, works well with my 4K TV"
1,Fire TV was easy set up and had no buffering issues.
1,"I love my Echo, the Alexa app is great I miss it when I'm not at home so I bought a Dot for work."
1,Bought for my kids. Perfect size (physical and storage) for them. Privacy settings allow for plenty of checks and balances against their purchases.
1,I did some research on different types of tablets and this one had what I needed
1,Alexa was easy to setup and begin using. It can answer just about any question you need an answer to. Loads of fun to use!
1,Great value. Perfect Christmas gift. Easy to set up and easy to use.
1,"Easy to setup, quick delivery! Great for beginner users of technology."
1,"The Amazon Fire is very versatile. Affordable, and can side-mount the Google Play Store."
1,Great entertainment and easy to use. Great sound when playing music.
1,Bought this as a gift for my senior citizen mother. She loves it!
1,Nice phone for the price. Would recommend if on a budget.
1,"I received the Dot for Christmas and loved it! So when I had the Best Buy dollars, I splurged and bought the Echo! Now I have the Dot in my bedroom and the Echo in family room for fun!"
1,This is the second one I have bought now. Quick delivery and service is great as always
1,Very easy to set up - even for 70 year old. Works like a charm. Alexa starts music and checks weather for us daily. Great addition to the home.
1,"I use his as a second screen to watch videos I've edited in my computer. It's fast enough to play a pretty big video file with no hiccups. However, multitasking is very limited."
1,"It's not the best speaker I've ever had, but for the price of what you're getting, it's pretty fantastic. Easy to interact with and lots of capabilities that are always expanding every week."
0,It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
1,50 buck will get you this ipad wannabe. Is it awesome? Meh. Will it satisfy your urge for a tablet? Maybe... A good gift? Probably
1,"Amazon Fire TV works very well with the Sony Play Vue. I purchased a second unit for another TV. The response time is quick and the Alexa voice search so quick and good its beyond good. I do not use the WiFi function although I have a Wifi in the house, instead I have a Ethernet cable plugged in for both units. I would most certainly buy this unit again. Worth every penny I spent on it."
1,"For the price you can't beat this tablet for kids. I'm not a fan of Amazon's super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can't access the tablet without your permission."
1,My son really loves his new tablet. This is agreat starter tablet for my 5 year old.
1,"Bought the Amazon Fire tablet to read books and brows the internet. Works well very happy,"
1,"I love my new echo! I have it sync with my android and echo will add items to your calendar, set alarms and even tell you a joke! It keeps getting better and better!"
1,"I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son."
1,I have always enjoyed my kindles. easy to carry and read.
1,I bought this tablet for 1 reason to get back into reading books. It is perfect for that. Didn't really mess around with anything else.
1,"the amazon Fire tv is amazing, it never buffers when I'm watching movies or tv shows in 1080p. I have referred this to friends and they have purchased this item."
1,Killer tablet for the price. No issues running any apps or programs.
1,"Love being able to use voice commands to play spotify, get weather updates, set timers, etc. I also connected it to my Smart Things hub so I can not control the lights in my condo via voice."
1,"This tablet is pretty good for a child, although what I dont like about it is you dont get Google play store"
1,This is my 3rd Fire TV and they all have performed very well.
1,This box let's anyone watch TV shows and movies. If you have amazon prime movies are free. Love it.
1,Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go.
1,It's great and it works very well with 4k makes all the difference in the world.
1,Got my granddaughter one & i surprisely received one for Christmas! Now i can do more while laying in bed! And my grandbaby get to watch Nick jr. On jer own leisure!
0,"This is not appreciably faster than any other 1.8 or higher amp charger when used with my Kindle, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, various Android tablets, and other devices that have USB charging cables.It also blocks an adjacent outlet. Why didn't they put the plug on the short end like the original black-and-white Kindle chargerIt is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a Kindle Fire HD on promotion, but the regular price is not competitive for a supposedly premium charger.Additionally, it does not come with a cable, an omission that many people won't realize.**EDIT** I appreciate the many comments, but Amazon promotes this charger as something that charges faster than other chargers, but I haven't seen any such advantage. At promotional prices, it's a good deal, but not at almost twenty dollars. Otherwise, look elsewhere.**EDIT** When the review was written, the description of the item did not have this statement Optimized for Kindle tablets: PowerFast is a 9W charger and will charge your Kindle tablets faster than the white 5W Kindle charger will. That line was added a considerable amount of time after I wrote my review."
1,"It was a gift. I was told that it is very fast. Easy to use, and a lot of available apps."
0,There have been a few minor changes included in this new Kindle that I don't particularly like.Opening page is slightly confusing.
1,Kids absolutely loved this gift for christmas!!!!!
1,Easy to use and great for downloading books from the library.
1,My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
1,Item was plug and play after connecting to wireless router. Add 16g SD card to improve buffering.
0,You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.
1,The Amazon fire TV is a great item to stream online content
1,Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
1,"This was actually my second purchase of this tablet. Overall the finish is good; everything works pretty fine. It has all of the amazon services that you need like kindle, amazon music.... The touch screen still has some delay, however. Once in a while they put it on sale for $30. If your not in a hurry, like if you already own a tablet and are not really in need of a second one, then you can wait because I believe at the price of 30, this tablet is unbeatable."
1,I lil tho version of kindle because theres no glare on it when ur outside n I wrk outside as a crossing guard n between shifts I read n I also read before I go to sleep n i can turn the light lower so it does not wake my husband.
1,"Pretty good tablet, especially if you have prime..."
1,Love the Item. Im completely satisfied with my buy.
1,Really works great and sounds good. A relative of mine had one and I knew I would have to get one. I could not believe the price when I finally bought it.
1,Perfect reader. Low back light means no eye fatigue. Could read all day and night if anyone wrote something new and interesting
1,"These are great little tablets when you get a working one. I had to call Amazon to return 3 times because they kept sending new faulty ones. Dead pixels on 3 out of 5 fires and also the screen had yellow tint and looked blown up or zoomed in making the text blurry. I had to keep 2 of the yellow tinted ones because that was better than dead pixels. I just ordered 2 more fires and hoping I don't get the same problems.Other than that they work super fast and the feel is sturdy and of high quality and makes it feel better in your hand than an iPad mini. We love this fire! *I have a transformer, iPad mini retina, Sony Reader, kindle hd 8.9, a note 4, a Sony z3, iPhone 6s, Galaxy s3 and s4 and LG G4 to compare with.Overall, this tablet is the perfect size and will not disappoint. And the new OS is much nicer than the older kindles."
1,This tablet is very user friendly. It was easy to use and a great value.
1,This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around.
0,I am sure Alexa does many things but so far she hasn't reached her full potential! User needs to learn to implement her skills!
1,"I bought this as a birthday gift for for my daughter. It's lightweight and thin so she can take it just about anywhere she goes. I'm glad I spent the extra for the backlit version, as she likes to read in bed before going to sleep."
1,way faster then the firesticks better wifi and comes with voice remote
1,"I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
1,"I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate."
1,I purchase 6 i f these tablets for my grandchildren. I was very surprise Iof how great they are. I ordered one for myself. this is a great tablet!
0,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
0,"Great for online content such as movies, TV shows, Music and games from the Amazon online store as well as streaming stored content from networked pcs or NAS boxes. You can also side load applications such as KODI for online content if you consider getting rid of cable television.I gave it 3 stars because even though it will allow for high definition video and theater surround sound, competing products can do those better."
0,"continually loses connection to the internet. app says it s connected but says check back later. Worked for the first month or so but now works one minute and dumb two minutes later. Constantly asking Alexa, Alexa,;ALEXA!!"
1,I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.
1,Great for price. Wish the Amazon App store had more apps. Overall good especially for prices.
1,Big Echo big sound! No need for a Bluetooth speaker.
1,Very easy to use. The Kindle app works well. Regular tablet search simple games email all work fine sometimes a little slow. I used this as my travel tablet and teader. The advertising is a pain but helps keep the price down.
1,Purchased this to get updates on weather and stock market but found many more uses. Many different apps to add during setup. And she tells jokes too.
0,"Bought i, was OK but don't use it anymore for the price it is good though"
1,"It literally speaks for it self!!! It's awesome to have something update me on news and entertainment! And the fact that it uses spotify for music as well, that's to awesome. I got it on my Birthday and told Alexa ( the echo's name) it was, and she said, "" happy Birthday"". That's Show's how personal it can get, then the other voice active products. The speaker works almost to well! I live in a 2 story town house, and the voice command can work as I'm walking down stairs. Just check the product out for yourself. You will want one!"
1,Bought this for my four year old niece and she loves it.
1,"This is a great product, my 8yr son is completely hooked onto it. The only change I would say it making the interface a little easier to use."
1,I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
1,"As a nook user, I had to make a change, so I tried the kindle. It is good."
1,"The uses for Echo are almost unlimited, but right now, it's controlling my home automation servers flawlessly !Talk about a ""Swiss Army Knife""... This is the whole drawer !"
1,"I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself."
1,My kids love it I have 6 of this and they all work good
1,purchased for my daughter to read and she loves it.
1,"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
1,"the Amazon Fire tablet is great for our daughter, has actually started reading more"
0,Like it. Worth the 50 $ just wish it only had a real Google play store
1,"The Paperwhite is very convenient. Great battery life. I still love books, but with the Paperwhite, I can have multiple books going at once, depending on what I feel like reading at the time. Overall a great product."
1,"Alexa is my best friend. She helps with shopping lists, keeps my calendar current and is always there to set a timer. She helps me change channels, plays my music. I really cannot live without her."
1,Its a great starter tablet for my kids. They love it and the price was right
1,purchase a cover to go with it and it feels just like you're reading a book
1,I had the firestick but upgraded to the box. Easy to use and with the straight connection to the Internet it is super fast.
1,"Great product, very easy to apply and I LOVE IT :)"
0,"can not down load any apps from goggle play, didn't know amazon and goggle don't have agreements to sharge"
1,Great I like the size easy to take anywhere some times smaller is better
1,Excellent tablet for kids. Does everything that an I Pad can do.
0,"The item was on sale over the Christmas period at a great price. Took it home and when I charged it up, the back of the tablet became very hot to the touch and the battery life reduced dramatically. Left it alone, tried it again, this time no issues. Four days later, it did the same thing when I was charging it up again. Sent it back for a refund."
1,Love it very easy for young readers. Would definitely recommend
1,Great educational tool. Not just a toy. Kids love it .
1,Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
1,I've had a few different Kindles since they were introduced and this is my favorite model by far. I love the way they lit - makes it much easier to read in the dark and outside versus reading on a tablet or a phone. The kindle lasts for months or a few books on one charge and is such a great way to have my books always with me on the go.
1,Great gift for Christmas for children! Inexpensive as well
1,Being used on a daily basis and never fails. Great product
1,This Tablet Is Absolutely Fantastic. Very Responsive On The Screen!!! Great Tablet For Those Who Don't Want To Spend $200+ for an Ipad.
1,"This was an upgrade from my original Kindle. I love the backlight screen! Even though the device is smaller than the original Kindle, I'm somehow able to read the font without my glasses. The battery life on this model is much longer too."
1,Love the backlight of the Kindle Paperwhite. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
1,"Best tablet ever, not just an ereader. I've had several tablets and this one is my fav."
1,"I had the Dot, but wanted more. The integrated speaker gives you the whole package. It really makes the portability happen."
1,This is perfect for reading in sunlight at the beach
1,Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches
1,Awesome it was great it was a lot of good apps I reccomend it
1,This product is totally worth buying. It's perfect for someone who likes to play games or read.
1,It's small enough to fit in my purse with ease. The back lighting works well in darker areas and i just love using it.
1,Great little tablet to travel with even for non-tablet types like myself. It can lag at times depending on what you are doing but great for the $33 I gave for it during the Thanksgiving sales
1,"Great fun r the little ones, had to go buy another because it works so well! Dropped many times and still is doing well!"
1,I had no problems with this tablet. Originally had a cheaper one that would crash every time I went to use it.
1,"Hey it's only a wall charger...Hey it's only a wall charger...Hey it's only a wall charger... Yet to fail, nough said."
1,I originally bought this tablet for my granddaughters birthday gift. When I saw how easy it was for her to access her homework and other reading materials she needed for school I was so impressed I bought 5 more for each one of my grand kids for Christmas I would recommend this tablet to family & friends.
1,My echo is so helpful and my whole family loves it!
1,"This little box packs quite a powerful punch, stream all your movies and shows, especially great with prime membership. ."
1,My little girl loves this tablet. It keeps her engaged and entertained. It comes with a protective case that protects it from falls and the handlings' of kids. You can download apps and with parental control you are protected from your kids accidentally making unnecessary purchases without your knowledge. Great tablet for kids!
1,I brought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my 9yr old son. It is the only present that he is still to this day playing with he loves his tablet.
1,Bought this for niece amd nephews. Was easy to set up and they loved it!!
1,I purchased the Fire TV after a few of my friends recommended it. I use it with my projector and the 13' screen picture is excellent. A similar product I was considering was almost $300.
1,"for the price you cant beat this, my daughter loves it and wont put it down and the protective case def helps when it is dropped trust me , cannot go wrong with a kindle for this price"
1,"We originally had a Fire Stick (and still use it with another TV). Once we subscribed to Sling, it seemed like streaming became more unreliable - increased buffering. We made two purchases to improve the situation: a Fire TV and a Wi-Fi booster. The two together definitely remedied the streaming issue. But the increased video crispness I/we give all the credit to Fire TV."
1,This product is awesome point blank. It still needs improvement in the conversation AI in order to be able to have that extreme edge over the google home. But overall I love the home automation that is compatible with the product. Most importantly how well this behaves with vivint.
1,Requires a bit more learning curve but once it gets use to you it is a lot of fun. Easy set up.
1,The Alexa unit is unique and very useful.. I would recommend this unit..
1,I love it it is just awesome all the things you can do
1,"Live where there isn't good cable provider or even satellite provider, Directv here on the coast of Puerto Rico is spotty at best, forget about it when it rains, which is daily in some seasons, the firetv works great with the 4G wireless hotspot I use."
1,"Works great with Amazon Prime Music. Very impressive speech recognition. (On the other hand, Amazon Prime Video Streaming is not Included in Apple TV or Roku apps.)"
1,"Easy to set up and lots of great functions. Can play music, summary of the news, link in for the smart home"
1,Purchased this as a gift for a first time tablet owner . They loved it ! Great product easy to use!
1,"Love the Kindle product and the paper white is easy to read in daylight, low light, and no light."
1,The Amazon Echo is the most amazing device you can add to your home. It makes everything more convenient. I highly recommend it to everyone.
1,"This was recommended to me. Good product, can avail Amazon prime and will automatically get hook up & have an access to it."
0,Pretty happy with my tablet. i mostly use it to try and play games.
1,Unit is fun. Combined with speaker to stream sirius xm.
0,"I wouldn't buy again, had trouble w/shutting off all the time, we would have it reset back to the factory reset status and it would lock up and freeze, actually replaced with second thinking that was just a bad one however sad to report same problems. Not a favorite purchase."
1,"Alexa has become a member of the family. She wakes us up in the morning, helps with math homework, plays music, and keeps track of our shopping lists! I can't imagine not having this device and the Dots in every room!"
1,Is a great tablet for small kids' wpuldnt buy ot for me though
1,I purchased one for myself and my mom to use for the word games & books to help enhanse her mind.
0,I would never buy another Amazon product personally. It works well but I'd rather use the rca over this. Personal preference has nothing to do with quality
1,"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort."
1,I purchased it for my cousin. It is a nice starter tablet for a child. Easy to use. Easy to set up.
1,This thing is the best thing I used I can u it to turn on my lights
0,Worked great the first week then started to reset randomly finally had to hard reset it works fine now maybe had an update I use it for my morning alarm and play music at night
1,I was even able to get the Google play store on it. Returned though since there was no option to leave the display always on.
1,It is a great product. Very reasonable price does exactly what my kids need it to do
1,"I had been looking into getting an Amazon device, and I was torn between the Echo and the Dot. I ended up getting the Echo and it has not disappointed! The sound from it is a very nice quality and I love asking Alexa to turn on the lights (you have to purchase other things to do this), play music, what the weather is like, etc. Overall a great purchase!"
1,"Wish I would 've bought this sooner. I would get rid of cable if I could find a way to watch sports on it, but for everything else its great. would highly recommend."
1,works great. just like the reviews said. thinking about another one
1,"I am always happy with the products I purchased, especially the Kindle Fire. The are reasonably priced. I have 3; one is for my granddaughter when she she visits."
1,"The Fire tablet is such a great value. If money is no consideration, there are better tablets out there, but for the money, this is a great choice, especially if you're a Prime member."
1,bought for grand kids front camera rear camera wifi ready games they caN SKYPE SO MANY THINGS you can use it for 2 YEAR NO QUETION WARENTY its your best buy
1,I pick it for one feature but it does so much more. I rave about it to everyone
1,Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy!
1,For the amount of money it is actually a good tablet.
1,I now have three dots/echos and am a fan. I really enjoy the capability of echo and ease of installation.
1,I'm not very tech savvy but we're getting there! I think this is a great price for a tablet that can do so much!
1,"Great little reader and browser. Have only played with it a little bit, however the feel amd flow are very accommodating. The feature-rich operating system allows for videos imported documents as well as books do you have previously read. All in all I certainly would get another one or purchased one as a gift for someone else ."
1,Very good tablet at a great price. Nice size for all applications.
1,The amazon fire tv is awesome. You can find any tv show or any movie you want from any year old or new.
1,It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it
1,I love my kindle paperwhite. So easy to read anywhere. Wish the battery lasted longer than it does.
1,Simple and easy to use! Great basic tablet! Perfect for kids!
1,It works pretty goodwork properly with the right Internet speed
0,Need Amazon account and bank account to use tablet. Bank card should be verified. Cheap product with terrible graphic. I returned that next day. Totally waste of money.
1,I bought this kindle on the way to the beach. I have an iPad but the glare is so bad. This has been great. I use it all the time outside.
1,Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models
1,"I was originally paranoid of these always listening devices but then I discovered what could be done with home automation and I was hooked. I now have 3 echos, an echo dot, and 3 dash wands. I can control my lights and tv now with my voice! The echo sounds fantastic playing music as well. Really cool devices."
1,I bought it for my son and he loves it. For the price you can ' t beat it.
1,"I have had so much fun with my echo and there are so many more things I want to explore with it. Love the weather reports, setting timers, playing music. My Wife has enjoyed it even my Mom wants one."
1,"I really like this product because I can get tv programs, music & movies that are not available with my cable box. It was easy to set up and easy to use. There are apps that you can download that makes this really fun to have. I was using the firestick and was having buffering issues, but with this speed has not been as issue."
1,serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
1,Very pleasing to eyes to read. Owned the previous paper white and this one has a better DPI (resolution). Got a great deal.
1,"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!"
0,Good compared to other systems like Roku but really need to get an easy way to close apps running in background.
1,"My 4 year old loves it. Easy to function and pretty tough, it has been dropped a few times and did not crack or break."
1,"I used to have a paperwhite-style Nook, but when it needed replacing, they no longer offered the device. Unfortunately, the newer Nook's screen would turn black and practically unreadable in the sunlight. So I got the Kindle. SOO happy! The screen is wonderfully readable, even in bright sunlight, and is capable of being back-lit for night-time reading as well. Best of both worlds ~ Especially since I seem to take reading material with me everywhere I go!"
1,We bought the fire for my 85 yr old aunt. She loves it!! Easy to use
1,Product is easy to use would recommend to anyone looking to automate there home
1,"I bought for my wife cause she couldnt see apps on her phone. This works great, now if i could just keep her from shopping"
1,7 year old son uses with ease. Older son already had a kindle and I also own on. Very good product.
1,"good for the price, speaker works ok. better with headphones"
1,My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
1,"Bought the echo a month or so ago, so far love the ability to ask questions and get answers. Will likely be purchasing another, or a dot for my mother as she loves it as well."
1,Very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read
1,Software is fast and easy to use. If you are a Amazon Prime member this is the streamer to buy.
1,This is so much better than trying to read on my phone. My eyes and head don't hurt from reading on the kindle like they would on my phone. Great product.
1,"Nice to have device at home, kidding are loving it."
1,Delivery was fast. The tablet has been good. My grandson loves the sports apps.
1,"I have an iPad and find it very difficult to read books on the iPad as there is too much glare and the text isn't sharp. This Kindle Paperwhite is fantastic and the fonts and text is just like in a paper book. It's easy to read, and allows you to adjust to the perfect setting for ones preference."
1,"I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time."
1,Charges all my items extra fast. Love it when I'm short on time
1,This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
1,My grand daughter loved it. She plays with it all the time.
1,My nieces and nephews love it. Even my 40 yrs old cousin got one and he is thrilled about it. Really easy to use.
1,Love device. Functional and easy set up. Enjoyed ability to just set up and use right away. My child liked available apps on Google play store.
1,"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
0,Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
1,Easy to set up. Availability of service is great. Enjoy the selections.
1,My daughter has a great time reading and researching and playing games on this.
1,I love this product. Perfect size for travel. I take it everywhere. Great for watching videos as well.
1,My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use
1,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
1,"I used to use a bluetooth speaker system now I use ECHO! The bluetooth box was stupid, Alexa is a smart lady. I Love it, the music alone is awesome."
1,"This is a very cool toy! Honestly the only main reason I actually pulled the trigger is smart light bulbs. I bought philips Hue bulbs and they all work flawlessly. Alexa will fail maybe 1 in 30 times. if that. Coolest thing is- I use a couple of the basic skills like timer and weather, and alarm, but they are constantly releasing new skills and improving the overall experience. So ...it's already good...and only going to improve with each update"
1,I bought this tablet for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!
1,Wire TV works perfect if you want all of your steaming in one place.
1,I do not use my Apple tvs anymore. Great for PS Vue and Prime.
1,I am still learning this product as it does not come with instructions/directions and is trial and error process. However I am pleased with what I do know about this product and the performance that I am getting out of it.
1,This kindle is a huge step up from my original kindle. The backlights and touchscreen make navigation super easy.
1,"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
1,"Its very light weight. Easy to get app installed, and my child has no problem watching her shows."
1,It's no iPad but you can't beat the price. Makes a nice gift.
1,I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
1,I got this tablet for $35 on black Friday. Plenty of speed for surfing the web and playing games. The screen looks pretty good for budget tablet. My 4 year loves watching movies and playing free games with it and setting screen time limits and other parental controls make it a great buy.
1,"The Kindle Fire 7"" is a very nice reader. I love how small and light it is."
1,Great price for a Kindle as a present for your kids
1,"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
1,"I love this product. The fact that I can connect the fire tv to an Ethernet cable is one of the best perks imo. It fast, the remote just works and there is no buffering"
1,Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.
1,"Purchased this tablet to use as a control panel for Action Tiles.It is a decent tablet for its really low price. Side loaded Google Play store and utilizing Kiosk Browser, I have Action Tiles displaying my Home status as to security, controls and Sonos speakers.Would recommend this tablet for this use and anyone wanting a bare bones tablet."
1,I works well for what it is. Great price and easy setup.
1,Its a good one for the normal songs and video viewing...
1,Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music
1,BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
1,Very pleased with my purchase. I would've definitely recommend.
1,"This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!"
1,Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
1,I purchased this item for my 10 year old son and he loves it. He is able to download books and any kind of games that he likes.
1,"Great product for the price, seems less fragile than the iPad."
1,I bought this table for my 8 year old nephew and he love it a bit small but for him its good
1,Easy to use.
1,It's a great tablet we use it alot when we travel .
1,"Great hardware. I owned the Fire Stick before getting this. It's WELL worth the extra money. Loads WAY faster and much less buffering. I love Amazon Prime. Wish there was better/newer/more frequent movies but for being included with all the other Prime services, it's a deal. And the Fire TV is the perfect way to access it."
0,"I have had several kindles, this latest one just doesnt seem to be as good of quality as the previous onrs i have owned"
1,"I bought this for a security camera display.I downloaded the app, connected the 2 devices and it is working out great."
1,I have had a kindle for a long time. I chose to upgrade to the Paperwhite. I am very happy with my decision
1,One of the best media streamers out there right now.
1,"Perfect for anyone who loves to watch any type of movie, always available at anytime,,,,"
1,This is an awesome device. It does everything advertised and then more! Weekly updates on new features are great to receive. No complaints.
1,"We bought this for my 86 year old cousin so she could download library books, play card games, and, most importantly, watch what her kids and grandkids post on Facebook. I myself have a Fire and found it very easy to use."
1,A great tablet to read books on Amazon for prime members.
1,"My son just loves his Fire tablet. Easy for him to setup to his liking. Can't beat the price either. At the time of the review it was $34.99. If you have kids, this makes a great gift for them."
1,"Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable...."
1,This is the second one I bought. My older son wouldn't share his so for Christmas santa brought little brother one lol. The apps that come with the subscription are endless. I also have Netflix and both kids watch different shows on it too. I once bought a sprout cubby tablet and it broke within 2 days and the customer service was terrible they would not replace and actually wanted to charge more than I paid. The customer service with amazon however is fantastic and replaced my sons tablet when it cracked within 3 days!! They are durable but my older toddler is Just a crazy lil man. You won't regret buying this for your kids.
1,"It was a toss up between this, the Fire, or the Paperwhite. I wanted something small, mainly for using w/Kindle; a color screen, expandable storage & wiFi capabilities. Helllo! It was very inexpensive & the perfect size! Great battery life!"
1,I got this tablet on thanksgiving night sales for my 7 year grandson he loves it
1,Works great. Love watching all my shows from a single source now.
1,"Purchased two at Christmas for my niece and nephew. They love them. They're safe for kids to use and easy. The only thing I dislike is the lack of control because of the fire software versus Android, but it's all good."
1,The higher DPI and built in backlight made this a fantastic upgrade from my previous Kindle Touch.
1,"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
1,Love my PaperWhiite Kindle. It's so easy to read and I especially like the non-glare for outdoors and ease with adjusting font size. I find I'm reading more books this way. Only thing I don't like is how heavy it is.
1,I bought for my wife as a stocking stuffer.... Got for a great price after black Friday. She absolutely loves it. I have the older version of this and this version is way better
0,Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
1,"Exelent shoppin, good product, great price, much better than some that cost up to 100 dollars."
1,"Great product! You get exactly what you pay for, plus more."
1,Just love the product I find my self using it more and more its grate for home automation lights on lights off whats the weather tell me a fact will do math calculation I had to ask I got what I paid for. HAPPY
1,Lets me choose the type of music I love. Can even go to the beach with me using my sling.
1,This is my second one. The first one I bought for my daughter for her birthday. Once I saw how it worked I needed one for myself. Still trying to get used to it but I really like it.
1,Easy to get on and use to work Amazon Fire tv as well as to surf the web.
1,This is a great ereader. Very comfortable to hold. The screen has built in light sensor so that it adjusts to ambient light and is always easy to see. You can go from dark room to blazing sunlight and always have a very visible screen.
1,"I just use it as a new phone charger for my android, you need to buy this if you buy a Kindle because the USB they come with doesn't have this attached."
1,"The Fire TV is an impressive device. There are tons of apps available and enough content for everyone. I recently cut the cord with Comcast and mostly view Prime content, which loads and plays quickly. The remote is super easy to use too. Great product and great value."
1,"I just have to say this product is fun and very functional. I get up in the morning and I get news briefings from her, then I can play games, and music all through the day, I am able to leave messages for other family members who have the same product and they can answer me back. I'm loving it!"
1,"Easy to setup, easy to use. I've had another tablet, but it wasn't as easy and comfortable to use. For what I bought it for, it's perfect for me. It weighs less than a pound (compared to my other tablet), and I can read what's on the screen easier. Without a manual, the best thing you can do is play with it. I'm still learning this and expect to get rolling on it very soon."
1,This is my 3rd Kindle. Need I say more? I have not been disappointed with this product and the value of the product is better each time I purchase it!
1,"It exceeds the expectations, amazing long lasting battery"
1,I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.
1,Great way to save on cable. Wifi enabled so really simple to install.
1,Great device for the amazon prime holder with 4k support.
1,Bought this on Black Friday. I think my kids will love it.
1,"i knew what i was buying and it was everything as described, love my kindle best part it fits perfect in the palm of my hand, very convenient to use"
1,Tablet is great does everythimg as it should. Great entry level tablet
1,"The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far."
1,This item is one of the best add-ones known to man. You can download almost every app to use on your TV. There is always updates to make sure it works properly. I've never had an issue with the Fire Stick.
1,Only one reason people buy these i for kodi. It's a great device and i love it i hated paying 100 dollars for it just because the sticks were sold out due to resellers
1,But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
1,great piece of technology. wish I would have found this sooner.
1,excellent graphic quality easy to use. does not use infra-red so other remotes will not work with it.
1,It's a nice tablet for the price. Very productive.
1,I bought 2 of these fire tablets for my children and I now want one for myself.
1,It has everything he needs. He is using the tablet each day.
1,This is the newest Kindle with improved resolution. Fantastic device for the beach or any outdoor reading.
1,Amazing for the price. Exactly what I needed and perfect for trips.
1,Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
1,"I bought this for a family member because they had the smaller 7"" Amazon Fire. The 10"" version can be held easier in my opinion"
1,"Convenient to use for music, news reports and the weather!Love the hands free ability to adjust volume or to change genre."
1,little hard to set up needed help to set up by son
1,"You get much better sound from the Echo than from the Dot - need to add a speaker to the Dot, adding to the cost. Wish these devices did a better job of looking info up on the internet. Siri seems to work better in that regard."
1,This is a great way to get rid of that monthly cable bill!
1,fun toy / tool / entertainmentplays pandora musicgets weather updatesnews
1,"Love this! I usually read at night, so I don't need a light on to use the kindle to read."
1,It work very well my nephew love it this is the second one is brought
1,The Kindle Voyager did not come with a charger so I'm glad I purchased this - although the Kidle Voyager does not need charging up as often because it stays charged for a long time. Mae Ogino
1,"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
1,I used this primarily as a Bluetooth speaker. It's good
1,This was a nice upgrade to my previous Kindle Fire. Thought would have a few more bells and whistles but I'm satisfied with the added speed and added Camera.
0,"I bought this for my 3 year old, so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my iPad. Needless to say, she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the Netflix app, and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem. You really do get what you pay for. If you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly. The Internet browser is really slow to use, but you can get around this by downloading Google Play store to access the Firefox app, which is not offered on the Amazon App Store. Check YouTube for instructions.."
1,"great size, easy to carry to take everywhere , good battery life"
1,My wifes last Kindle gave out after about 5 years so I went with the fire this time and she loves it.
1,"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know."
1,"Bough the tablet for my 11 year old nephew, loves it! Great for online games and videos."
1,"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far."
1,"Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I'm a happy reader!"
1,Absolutely love it. So lightweight and convenient to take on the go!!
1,Purchased this for my wife. She likes it. Can't go wrong with it.
1,"You can convert this to a kid kindle, very durable. Quality is great for the price"
1,We love using this product around the house we are constantly listening to music and whatever we feel like listening to we play and listen to immediately we really enjoying the Amazon echo and have recommended it to all members of our family and friends who do not currently have it.
0,I had an insignia tablets before they are very low on saund
1,The tablet is very functional and it is offered at a great price. It had everything I was looking for in a tablet. I am very pleased with my purchase.
1,It has a timer for kids when you set the time you want it on and the off
1,Bought this for my GF. She loves it. Can't put it down. She uses it every night before she goes to bed. Easy to read. Fellas if you want your ole lady out of your hair I recommend purchases this for her!!!
1,very easy to use and has met all of my xpectations
1,Bought this because it's lightweight and easy to adjust display for in bed reading. Have difficulty reading physical books as my vision is changed. I enjoy using this kindle although I have other readers including nook iPad and kindle hd. Very pleased with this purchase.
1,Never knew I needed a tablet until I got my hands on this one
1,"This is my second Echo and I also have a Dot. Decided I needed one for my office. Sound is great, set up was easy. I would say that Alexa has gotten used to my voice because I find it is 95% accurate. And, the few times that is just pops on when I didn't request it...well I go to my Amazon account to see what it picked up. Usually good for a laugh. One day it played a children's song ""The wheels on the bus go round and round"". You can't go wrong with one."
0,"I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it."
1,If you have prime and Netflix this is what you need. Voice search is great on prime.
1,"This kindle is great for reading books. Which is exactly what it's designed for. Very crisp text in bright daylight or complete darkness. It feels good in your hands (weight is balance, it doesn't feel flimsy either). Quick page transitions when reading. Don't expect it to compete with tablets in the app or visuals departments, because that's not what it's meant to be used for. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at times."
1,So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
1,I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it
1,Easy to set up. Easy to use. Happy with my purchase.
1,"Bought the Alexa as a Christmas gift family and co-workers. They all have raved about Alexa being their ""best friend"". Unfortunately, I didn't get one for myself."
1,"Love the firetv box. It is faster than the firestick, had more storage space n allows for ethernet cable connection for more stable connection. If u get a tv with roku built in there can be interference between box n tv. Dont get roku built in tv with this box."
1,Great reader with incredible battery lifeWould Def buy again
1,Perfect for teens as well as adults who loves to read and watch movies
1,"Light and easy to read, battery lasts a good while. The built-in light makes it a pleasure to use at night in bed."
1,This was a Christmas gift for mother and she loves it because it allows her to play game and read instead of using her phone which is much smaller.
1,"Easy to operate, glare free adjustable brightness is great for nighttime or daytime reading."
1,A great device that has a variety of channels and many apps the have a lot of entertainment
1,"So far it is working well, it does answer some questions, but not as far advanced as your I Phone does yet, however I have confidence that the Echo will be be continually learning as Amazon upgrades it."
1,"Bought this kindle mainly for my kids. There are plenty of games that my kids, and I, enjoy playing. Having the expandable memory slot was one of the reasons I purchased this model. Happy with my purchase....we have three of this model."
1,Wanted to give my father another way to read his books or play his games without lugging around his laptop. He hasn't put it down since he was given it for Christmas. Easy to use and has a lot of options available for apps.
1,Item arrived within estimated delivery date. Package received in good condition. Product performs as advertised in its description.I feel it is a must for kindle owners or any e-reader for that matter. I find myself reading in areas far out of reach of my computer so having an outlet charger becomes a necessity. I would recommend it to any kindle owner.
1,good and excellent product and good serive bestbuy
0,Just wish I could remove most of the Amazon apps other then that it's good for the kids.
1,The fire was very easy to set up right out of the box.
1,Hard wired as opposed to wireless. Easy to install. Much better than fire stick
1,"Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy"
1,It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids
1,"Echo is phenomenal. I find myself asking for definitions, music, weather, news and changing my thermostat. I'm looking forward to see the future with echo"
1,"I like the small, light weight size, and the adaptive lighting. But the page turning is too sensitive, skipping ahead many pages when I am just moving the Kindle, and going back and then forward when I am trying to change just one page."
1,This was for my sister birthday. She really like it a lot.
1,"This tablet isn't the brightest, lightest, fastest, thinnest tablet on the market, but i have Amazon Prime and it allows me to shop, do a little gaming, watch videos and movies, listen to music, read books, and browse the internet. I mean really, what else do you do with a tablet. More that satisfied."
1,"I love my Kindle, I bring it everywhere with me. Great for the price."
1,"Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
1,The best streaming device on the market right now. Don't waste you money on anything else
1,Is very good on the camera and features will recommend
1,"Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for "" older eyes""."
1,Great wait to watch TV and not have a hugh Cable bill. Wish I had this years ago
1,Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet
0,It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
1,"I think Alexa is great. We first saw it while visiting family and were intrigued. We used our Best Buy point, so the risk was minimal. Alexa is great at answering questions related to whether, sporting events, calendar, shopping and todo lists. I like that I can print out my todo and shopping lists and that she can add events to my online calendar. We haven't even scratched the surface and we love Alexa already!! We also decided to join Amazon prime and are very satisfied so far...keep up the good work Amazon!!"
1,I bought this for my grandson and he loved it and it easy for him to handle without help
1,I own a Echo and have now purchased a second one for my Daughter as my whole family loves to ask questions and play music.. I would recommend the Echo to everyone. Music is crystal clear and volume can be lowered or raised upon voice command.
0,I could have done without it. You need to install a whole bunch of apps to have a competent Alexa. I guess Echo would work better with a Smarthome. Sometimes it has a hard time with my accent.
1,I bought 8 of these for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. So easy to use my 75 year old mother picked it right up and started using it. Love love love my fire
0,"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
1,"I BOUGHT THIS TABLET FOR MY GRANDSON IN HIS BIRTHDAY, AND HE IS SOOO HAPPY"
1,Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.
1,"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
1,Pages are white and bright - indeed like a paper.Font and ability adjust its style and size gives perfect readability.Batteries last for very long time - long enough that you do not think much about charging them.
1,This was given to me for my birthday and I love it...
1,"My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied."
1,Battery is nice. Screen looks amazing. Couldn't have asked for anything better.
1,"Before the purchase, I was concerned that the unit will be as slow and awkward to use as some other entry-level tablets that I had purchased in the past but I was very wrong to think that. This tablet is fast and easy-to-use. Way to go Amazon!!!"
1,I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased
1,She loves it. It works really well and its features are amazing
1,Its hands-down is the best advice for smart home today. From controlling lights to music and security systems echo has it all! I would highly recommend this for anyone who is starting off with their smart home.
1,"I originally bought the more expensive, Voyage model, and I definalty prefer this one. It is much easier to grip, and is doesn't get as smudgy. I could not tell much difference in the screen quality, the major noticeable thing was the Voyage has a smooth screen, and this one is a little rough to the touch, but that doesn't matter at all."
1,This is bleeding edge technology. It's not a Google search but with new skills being added all the time it's a great way to use technology.
1,Good product for the price and if you're looking for a basic tablet this is perfect. I ended up getting an iPad mini 2 as well but this will suffice the basic user.
1,"Very cool and lots of features, I can play just about any song as a prime member, just say ""Alexa, play...."" or set timer for and set alarm for...I heard there are these modules and light bulbs the Echo can control. In the near future a device like this will be the center of your home controlling security, TV, heat/air, lights....so cool. Until then I love my Echo"
1,Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great!
1,I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it!
1,I like this .fun to play . Someone did a great job.!
1,I like this tablet a lot. The size is good. The screen is good. It functions well. This is my second fire tablet. I really like that it automatically installs (syncs) apps from my first tablet at start up. Very convenient. The price was very good. Ordered on line with same day pick up at the local best buy. SWEET!
1,I've never really liked Kindle's for some reason or another. This one looked and felt really nice. I knew that I would love it as soon as I got it out of the box. It has a very premium feel and is a great substitute for a book.
1,Lots of enjoyment. Beautiful speaker great sound great listening pleasure
1,The tablet is up to date technology. My daughter surf the internet fast and no slow download.
1,I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
1,"Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect."
0,I bought this tablet on black Friday and went home to test it out and it was very slow and not worth the money
1,Easy to use. Great size. Great price. Easy to navigate.
1,"Great little lap top with touch screen, absolutely ruins you."
0,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's 8yr old daughter. She absolutely loves it, and it was easy to set up and use."
1,"We got this for my wife to take with her when travelling. Although she still prefers printed books, she really likes this reader and it lightens her suitcase considerably. Excellent battery life and a good screen."
1,A must buy if you want to read without the hassle of a physical book!
1,Love this product. Neat design and easy to navigate.
1,Bought this as a replacement for my child's iPad. Took her a little while to learn the new OS but once she got the hang of it it was pretty easy. Lots of content and excellent at the price point.
1,It is so easy and very fast. I never thought this was fast until I got it. It is everything I need/
1,I own the Kindle Fire HD 6 and love it...this is a Christmas gift for a friend. Hopefully she will love it. Great price
1,"Still learning all of the different things Alexa can do. Love having access to information about the weather, traffic, etc as well as music at a command. My daughter loves asking her questions. Very entertaining for friends as well"
1,"Would not buy it at full price. Got it half price on a promotion. Enjoyed it, Speaker sounds ok. I enjoyed its music more when connecting to my external Bluetooth speaker. Taught Alexa to turn on and off 3 power switches. Wish there were more skills Alexa can learn. I have 2nd thought about making purchases with Alexa because I read people having issue with Amazon vendors when ordering with Alexa and automatic payment."
1,"Great product for the kids to keep them quiet, it a"
1,I love this tablet! It's easy to use and set up! I love reading books and magazines on the tablet! The apps are great and easy to use! This is an all around great device!
0,The kids were loving these as Christmas gifts but here we are 6 months later and the battery charging port barely even works. We have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge. I wasn't expecting a super long life out of these tablets at $39.99 a pop but should've lasted longer than 5-6 months. Very upset with 4 sad kiddos.
1,"Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too"
1,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
1,We actually purchased this as a Christmas gift for our son. However my husband ending up keeping it for himself. He uses it at night to read books in bed.
1,"I picked this over the fire stick due to the user interface for PS vue, it's a much cheaper alternative to paying for cable."
1,"I live on my fire tablet and love this one, great graphics and speed"
1,Very very beautiful design...and very good sound..great quality.........like it..!
1,So easy to use and keep track of what children are doing .
1,"Love the Kindle FireGreat size, Good Resolution, Alot of Apps"
1,"Price is right, my kids love this tablet, like more"
1,My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
1,"For a tablet, good price and functions. Was tired of working a lot on smart phone. This is a good substitute. Will even order books."
1,Great tablet for the money! Made for a great Christmas gift
1,"i think amazon fire tv has more to offer than apple tv. really good, easy to use"
1,this is a replacement for the kindle that i dropped. I love the new features of this model.
1,Easy to use and great value. Excellent viewing with good color
1,"Great tablet. Fast and easy to use. Got it as a black Friday sale thinking it was going to be a slow out of date tablet, but was surprised at how much I like it and use it. No lag, no bugs, has yet to freeze and great battery life."
1,"a good product, I would recommend it to others looking for similar products"
1,So easy to read & defines words you are not familiar with.
1,Gifted to kid and they liked it. Screen resolution is not great but sufficient
1,Product was easy to install and is easy to use just ask questions. Also great as you you can setup operating home automation to make life simple and easy.
1,I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and he loves it!
1,Fire tv is great!!! Easy to use!!!! I love that you can speak to give it commands
1,"I love alexa ,she plays all my favorite song , and i dont gotta move a finger to do it."
1,I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.
1,The person I bought it for is very pleased with it.
1,"good product, takes some time to train it how to use our other smart divices."
1,"This KindleFire was exactly what I needed, for light weight, portable entertainment for my granddaughter on a trip. I could access all of the audio books, games and reading material from the audible app and kindle app on my iPad, onto this small device that slipped easily into my purse. it was easy to use on the airplane as well as in line at Disneyworld, without taking up much space or being heavy."
1,I purchased this for my granddaughter to read books and it was perfect.
0,"I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better."
1,Super fast and easy to use I love this box and it's freatures
1,"Shipping was fast, well packaged and Easy to use!!"
1,Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable
1,"Alexa looks great in my ciunter, she responds quickly ti my request. Im sure amazin will be adding more features innthe near future! At least i hope so"
1,Amazon Kindle pleased my lady !! She is very happy with the Kindle and with the GSP added im not worried about it crabbing out either.
1,Have both boxes and they work very well without any issues. I bought many for family and they also enjoy and use them daily.
1,"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have."
1,"Amazon makes this tablet a no brainer. The performance and price are unmatched by any other tablet on the market. As and entry level tablet with all the entertainment extra Amazon offers, it is a great deal."
1,"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment."
0,"I recently purchased this Amazon Fire for my daughter, i like that it has the little accent of a night light, so if we are watching a movie in the dark, she can still use it without illuminating the entire room. features are average, just like any other tablet. It is a little bulky but for a child, it gets the job done. Pretty sturdy when its dropped. Doesnt have much storage, but the good news is you can add your own SD to create more storage."
1,"love this product everyone needs one of these , listen to favorite music use it as a timer in the kitchen ask it a question and get your answers"
0,"First, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray."
1,Greate good love it watch what every I won't sjdhfhdhhsjx
1,"I bought this for my wife , she loves it, I would recommend this to any one who wants a small tablet that can do about everything."
1,"If you'd like a small tablet that can do virtually all that a large one can do, this is the one. And the price is great."
1,very interesting how Alexa knows mostly everything
1,A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids
1,"Best thing we ever purchased! Amazon TV is awesome, best move we ever made. we cut the chains from Directv and don't even miss it. There are so many things to watch and there are in-app purchases as well if you want to expand your viewing pleasure. still cheaper than Directv or cable. Highly recommend this."
1,"Amazon Fire TV is amazing, lots of free channels and old and new movies you can even watch Netflix for free. We will be ditching satellite dish and saving $160 per month. In addition we will be adding Amazon Fire sticks to other TV's through out our home. Product is very easy to use."
1,"Love being able to make my shopping list, listen to news. weather, playlists, and more. I am finding new ways , each day , to use it."
1,This is a far better product than the fire stick that I first started out with it is a lot faster at everything it does and it hardly ever buffers. I would recommend to spend the extra money and get the fire tv.
1,"Gave this as a gift, and I have to say, it does everything he wants a tablet to do. Win win!"
1,It works great. Awesome device. A great way to ditch your cable service provider.
1,"I was traveling and wanted a tablet to fit in my purse. This is perfect for me. I can look at my emails, facebook, do my banking and read the local papers, also kept up on all events in the area I traveled. I love it and so happy I purchased it!!"
1,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
1,Bought this for my sister and she loves it! Much easier to read from than an IPad.
1,This is a simple way to get all the channels you want in one location.
1,Got this for the kids and the love them. !!!!!!!!!!!
1,It's been great to have Alexa there to answer questions and play music. The Skills are fun to use as well.
1,The firetv is so easy to use. Plug it in and go. Affordable & lots of great apps
1,"I now have two of these devices. I control my lights, thermostats and wall switches through this."
1,It's a good little tablet but just a little annoying because of the ads on the lock screen to make us have to pay more for the tablet to get a tablet that doesn't have the ads on the lock screen is kind of ridiculous. So for that reason I only gave it 4 stars it's a good tablet does what they say it does but don't like the fact that you have to pay extra to get a tablet that is ad free.
1,"I use the echo to turn on and off lights, play music, and control my air conditioning. I bought a WiFi thermostat and smart plugs to plug my lights into and they work well with it. I like it, but I wish I did more useful stuff. Like I don't need alexa to tell me a joke."
1,Great product. Great performance. Skills take some getting used to but lots of possibilities.
1,"I can't stop using it. It's all you ever need in a tablet, Netflix,Youtube,Facebook,Games,Music,Movies and much much more!!! Great screen resolution and all for an affordable price!!!!"
1,"Love that the Tap is portable. Drag it all around the house and outside. I'm not an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is very good except at the highest level. Only wish it was always listening when it is charging on the dock."
1,Great for the kids. Everyone in my family has one.
1,Awesome. Better than expected. Cannot live without Alexa
1,"Bought Alexa as kind of a novelty gift and it ended up being pretty cool. We haven't even tapped into all of the things it can do but it gives you the weather, news, etc. and with the addition of Amazon Music, will play virtually any song you ask. The speaker is adequate for music, etc. She (Alexa) doesn't know everything but neither does Siri. Wife and kids love it and although a little on the pricey side, is a lot of fun."
1,While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
1,This is the best ereader I've ever owned. Very responsive and lightweight.
1,"The Amazon Fire TV was an excellent purchase. I do not regret canceling cable TV. Streaming Hulu, Showtime, Netflix when I want. You can't beat it."
1,"I purchased this wall charger because I have had issues with Samsung and other Kindle chargers. So far, this charger is great. Devices charge rapidly."
1,Great tablet for the price to buy for your kids versus buying the more expensive ipad
1,Ordered one for my daughter. It's the fourth Kindle we have bought and love them. Perfect for watching videos and movies.
1,"Purchased for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas, I don't think she's put it down ever since. I also downloaded Skype (to replace facetime) so that she can speak to relatives through video."
1,This is a great product and use and connectivity are simple. Works well with my internet and TV....gives my smart TV an IQ boost..
1,"I can definitely live without it but what the heck, it is fun. I use it mostly right now to play music and turn lights off and on. I can tell it to turn on my driveway lights without going out in the garage and doing it myself. It is a great aid in the kitchen . I use it to add to my grocery list, make appointments , and to-do list. There is no end to what you can do with it to make like easier and keep organized. It can't cook, clean floors, do dishes but it can tell you how you should do it. It is a great little toy and help."
1,I purchased this in order to stream Playstation Vue. It works very well for this. Amazon also offers 4K content - one of the few places you can get it for now.
1,"I really like the simplicity of the Amazon Fire Stick. It is a great product from when I am on the go and I can plug it in where ever I have a WiFi connection. It is easy to use and simple. If you are looking for basic but functional, Fire TV is a good buy."
1,My new kindle is great for for my bible classes. I can reference the Catholic Bible and Catholic Catechism easily and download readings. I got one for my friend too.
1,I bought the Amazon Echo as a gift for my wife for Mother's Day and she's used it everyday since. My kids utilize the 'Simon Says' game and it also serves as a great music player.
1,I am ALWAYS impressed with all Amazon products !!!
1,"I m enjoy having Alexia around. Shes my DJ, Comedian, and news caster all in one."
1,Previous owner of an older kindle. Love the touch pad and back light on the voyage.
1,So far I am enjoying it and adding other compatible devices with it makes it amazing.
1,Would be 5 star if it had the capability of being a wireless speaker as well
1,I would of never have considered getting Alexa until I house sat and the owners had one. I love music and she could play every genre keep in mind you have to sign up for 2.99 monthly fee it is so convenient just to ask her to play music and the sound from such a small unit is phenomenal. I also purchased the starter kit for the lights she will turn them on and off by your request and you can set it up on a timer which is great when you're out of town .
1,"Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!!"
1,"Bought this for an Xmas present for my 7 yr old with the monthly program through Amazon he has access to age appropriate books, videos, games love that he is not able to play something that is not in his age group."
1,Addons loaded very fast and was very impressed with the processor speed. Would buy again.
1,The paper white kindle is much better than the original. Great for reading in any light! One of my better purchases!!
1,Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.
1,I have seriously enjoyed having Alexa. She makes it a breeze to reorder any supplies I may need for my home such as toilet paper or trash bags. I also love playing jeopardy with her and listening to music. She's also an awesome smart home hub and was so easy to sync with my hue lights and speakers. Definitely a purchase I'm glad I made.
1,This is great for ur tv if an amazon customer. Only thing Alexa needs improvements!!
0,Great price.... It's good for games play and great tablet with this price
1,"I love my Amazon Fire TV. It's an amazing device! It's quick and very responsive. Overall, I believe it's the beat streaming device on the market!"
1,"Not only does what Siri does, but it takes it one step further by completing tasks that you ask it to do, like ordering pizza or ubers, which I do plenty of. With extra devices hooked to lights in your home, for example, you can ask Echo to turn your lights on, dim them, etc., before entering the home. This can be a real safety feature."
1,I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
1,My kid loves this thing. Everything is easy to download and easily accessible for my 5 year old. Also pretty fun for myself if l can ever get ahold of it from her. Lol.
1,Easy to sync with my account. Love the size and ease of use
1,I purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. So far so good! It's a perfect fit for my two younger children. And I feel you can't beat the price for a Fire. I have control on what they access. The only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. When charging I have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.
1,"I bought this Amazon fire TV to reduce services from my cable TV provider. The unit itself is small and unobtrusive. As I already have an Amazon Prime account, setup and registration were simple and straightforward. The unit works as it should. It is fast and the voice search works better than I expected. I have only had the Fire TV for a few weeks, so I cannot speak to long term reliability. So far, absolutely no problems with the unit. Fire TV is a great addition for Amazon Prime subscribers."
1,overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
1,I love Alexa! She has been a great addition! Would recommend her to anyone
0,"Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. It's a decent tablet for the price I paid. i find it much different than Samsung tabs or Apple iPad. so if you're used to these, amazon might not be a good pick for you. My grandson is disappointed we can't get YouTubekids on it. I've caught myself saying I should have paid a little more and gotten a Samsung. All in all, decent Tablet for a kid."
1,I love my Fire TV! I'm both an Amazon Prime and Netflix customer and this works very well for me! I haven't had mine very long but I use them everyday ( I have 2 of them) so I am learning to navigate through them very well. I also use the Amazon Music quite a lot! Great product!
1,"I have purchased this item to give as gift. It works great for kids. I only wish it had few build in apps that a child could start using right away. Anyhow, its great for kids, whether in us or anywhere in the world. I have definitely recommend this to all my friends and family."
1,Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet.
1,"We bought the box to see if it would make sense to dump cable. The ease of use is one sell, but the fact I can watch anything and not worry about junk sold it for me."
1,"It is the second I bought it, the first was given to my mom, it is very easy to carry while you travel."
0,"Durable and small, makes it easy for taking any where. Price isn't bad either."
1,Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content.
1,"Purchased for myself & I just love it......very easy to work with, great features & great price...I would highly recommend this product!!"
1,I bought five of these for ages 4 to 14. They all loved them and were up and using them within 5 minutes. Was their favorite gift!!!
1,I really like this item. It is easier to carry around than my iPad when going to appointments and has all my kindle library on it. I did purchase a scan disk to ncrease its memory and am still learning how to use it. Having wifi capabilities is a plus.
1,Awesome product it's better than cable t.v my family and all love it
1,This is the right size to carry around. Really like this Tablet.....
1,Bought this for a 8 yr old and its perfect for what she like to do
1,I am very happy with this purchase. Works perfect.
0,"Family of 5 and now 6 with Alexa. Seriously she adds another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility. Kids play games with her, like 20 ?s, jeopardy, riddles, jokes, and daily Easter eggs. While the adults like smart concerts, sports highlights, news briefs and all the things your ""Siri"" can do, by more. Like turn on/off your lights, coffee maker, tv, and whatever else you hook your smart outlets to.(sold separately) Now for the ""Alexa bugs."" More often than not, we find ourselves repeating commands. Attempted fix, by using voice training multiple times in areas we are most when aroud Alexa. Saw minor improvement. We also wish the command to increase or lower volume was more efficient. Shouting ""Alexa, volume 5 multiple times after a song you liked was at volume 7 or higher is annoying. We've learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo? I was curious how Alexa would respond to 5 different voice patterns. Surprisingly , once she hears her name and the command prompt, she responds correctly 89% of the time.My wife tells me I'm cheating on ""Siri"" and ""Cortana"" as ""Alexa"" has quickly won my heart and my kids as well. We're glad we went with this, not the dot or google home. If you plan on making voice purchases as commercials advertise, careful- your kids might order 50lbs of cookie dough as Alexa doesn't recognize who's voice is ordering it. Overall, the gimmicks wear off, but we routinely enjoy smart concerts and our smart light system. soon we will be asking these robots to do our dishes, laundry, cook, or whatever else humans don't feel like doing. Hopefully I see this unfold in my lifetime- Brunsch"
1,Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
1,I was very pleased with this not only is it a great tablet but a great price.
1,Bought for a birthday gift. They loved it. We found ourselves playing with it for hours.... Alexa what is???
1,Love using this for music. Will sometimes have to repeat the command 2 or 3 times before Alexa will understand and then do e command that was given
1,My fire TV did not disappoint !! I am able to do everything I wanted to do and then so much more !!
1,"Nice tablet, many apps for android were also available for the fire operating system. More free apps then android."
1,Definitely got the job done. This tablet is nice size and affordable
1,this made a nice gift. iam sure everyone would like to receive one
1,"This tablet looks and feels nice. Good battery life, and great images. Good value for the money."
1,Good for a starter tablet for the kids. Love the parental control option
1,"She's tall and smart! She's sensible. Soft spoken but firm. She can answer (most) questions without a hesitation! She's all fact! She hears well. She has a good ""lung"" when we want her to sing loud! She can tell jokes -- not ""ha ha, too funny"", but good enough! Amazon Prime/music plays a big part of her -- another word she'd mostly be muted if we don't play music from Alexa (she sings for the dog too when we leave home). Like it that can ask her to play songs of the year, i.e. 1969 vs. by category or musicians. Glad brought her home! Fun with her around! She was on a one-day sale at BBY when I paid for her, so it's all good! I don't believe in paying full price, even for something as smart as Alexa!"
0,It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab
1,We bought these for our grandchildren they were a hit.
1,I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the charging port. There is a small metal prong that lines up with the cable that can get bent if you do not plug it in VERY CAREFULLY. Have had to send one back because it would no longer charge. Otherwise great tablet.
1,"Great device to play music, use connected devices and get questions answered."
1,Works great having lots of fun asking questions. I have it connected to my smart home and insteon lighting so now everyone can easily operate the house by voice. There was a learning curve as to how to communicate with the Echo but easily learned
1,It is so easy to use even my 4 year old has been using it!
1,The kids love it! They love the different colors so that everyone knows which one is theirs.
1,"The Echo is awesome. It works like a champ and once you get used to the commands, you find that even a remote control is not enough. Highly recommend it."
1,"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger"
0,"The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness"
1,I bought this tablet as a gift for a preteen to purchase ebooks . So far it's been working good. Good price good starter tablet.
1,Love the new Amazon Fire TV. It is real fast and the thing I like best about it is that you now can put in a SD Memory card for a lot more space. Cheaper and better then the new Apple TV.
1,"Very helpful for keeping fitness, health and weight goals"
0,"I've had every Kindle e-reader available. Though it doesn't have all the features available on the Voyage, the Paperwhite is the best. The issue I've had are the emergence of tiny light ""leaks"" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. They're little pinhole-sized, bright light scattered across the page. It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does. I went through 3 Voyage models before surrendering and returning to the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite has fewer total lights, so it's not as evenly lit as the Voyage, however, it's nothing significant."
1,"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming"
1,Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane
1,It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases
1,Really loving the Fitbit Blaze so far. It reminds me to keep pushing and motivates me to stay active. The features are awesome and battery life is amazing. I definitely recommend this watch to someone looking to start being active/continue to be active/or push their limits. Great investment. FYI (it's a fitness watch not a true smartwatch)
1,Purchased this for my kindle and it does what it's intended to do. Quality looks fine as well.
1,"If you want to read books without the bulky books, this is what you need. Lightweight even."
1,What else can I say about this product other than it is truly fun and amazing. We spend hours finding new things to watch
1,Good tablet at a low price you should buy one now .
1,"This Kindle7"" reader is light weight for carrying around."
1,Good for kids and adults sometimes it takes a little time to pull up old movies but shows great.
1,Love this! Very easy for child or adult to use. Great price too
1,"The Paperwhite provides backlighting so that it can be read in dark environments. It still has the same long battery life as the original. The software is pretty much the same. I gave up the Whispernet capability in upgrading, but haven't missed it much since I always have plenty of unread material already downloaded over Wi-fi."
1,Great product and great price! Worth more then what you pay!
1,"Compact , inexpensive , easy to use . I would recommend"
1,"We love the Amazon Echo! The speakers sound great and it's so easy to ask for Alexa to play my music when I'm cooking, cleaning, etc. It's fun discovering all of the things she can do. We can't wait to get another one (or two.)"
1,"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
1,"After seeing and playing with the Amazon Echo at my sister's home, I just had to have one. After having it for a bit, I'm looking towards the future and what Alexa will hopefully do next. Already have the Nest thermostat and Hue lighting, but there's more potential. Will wait and see..."
1,I was looking for something easy to use if I didn't want to go on the computer and for 50$ this is great
1,I was so against getting one but finally caved! This is so easy to use and i take it with my everywherePerfect for reading outside or on the train
1,This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
1,I got this as a gift and I must say the sound is better than my Bose speaker. I not only listen to music but it turns my lamp on when I ask. Alexa also can give me the traffic report as well as weather she tells jokes and many more things. I think everyone should have one of these!!
0,"There are some things I can't download. But, good."
1,Kindle GUI interface works like my Android!! Fast and friendly!! Thank you Best Buy!!! Keep the hits coming!!
1,"I love this thing , I recommend it for everyone a must have"
1,My children love this. Cant beat the price. Need one more for myself.
1,Got tablet for my daughter..love everything about it and how easy it is to use.
1,Very good when using with vivant. Also good when you want need to know something like the weather.
0,Its a great gift for my little one and he loves it
1,We bought these for the kids and they just love them. With the parental controls on it we don't have to worry about where they go on the Internet.
1,"This is my third Kindle, but first paper white. This is by far my favorite. I took it to the beach and could read perfectly in the glaring sunlight. I can also use it at night, when my husband is asleep and the room is dark. Lightwieght and easy to tuck away in my purse. LOVE IT!"
1,"I enjoy this device. Something new to continually ask Alexa. The speakers are great, easy to pair, easy to use and set up."
1,"This is a nice item to get especially when your husband is a movie buff. It will allow you to go to extended channels in order to watch whatever taste you may have for watching TV.. It allows you watch all kinds of sports from soccer, to football, to baseball to lacrosse, to whatever interests you."
1,My best purchase to date. This product is awesome.
1,Bought this during the black Friday sale and really a nice tablet; the UI could be a little better but OK for a $ 35 device.
1,I love my Echo so much fun. the set up was so easy .
1,For the price is great up to the minute on everything
1,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
1,I am so happy with this purchase. I no longer have a cable or satellite bill to pay every month. Saves me $160 a month. Easy to use once you learn
1,"My 3yo is quite rough with stuff, as most are. And the case that comes with it is great!!"
0,Decent product. Not so much if you're used to android software. You can't get your photos saved in google. More than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted. Basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor. Exchanged it for am android tablet
1,"Excellent device, wish I had bought the bigger one."
1,Bought this to use with my kindle voyage and I love it. It charges my Kindle in 3 hours or less sometimes and the battery lasts for weeks.
1,Great Price Great product. Great sound for such a small system
1,"Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!"
1,"Upgraded from a Fire Stick so I could use Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi. Much better performance (at least for me). Easy setup. Mostly plug-play-enter user names and passwords for services. Somewhat Amazon centric, but works well for Netflix and other Apps. Hoping they add support for Apple."
1,"After much resistance | broke down and purchased my Kindle Fire, just prior to a trip. I read three books during my free time. With limited packing space I would only have been able to carry one."
1,Extremely sturdy construction. This is a great tablet and very durable. It can take a fall and keep working as if nothing happened. I would recommend this for someone who has a special needs child. I would definitely buy another one.
1,Great product for the price. I would buy NVIDIA shield if it wasn't too expensive
1,"I had purchased a Fire HD about a year ago from Amazon so this was a second. It is not in constant use, but I can take the pictures of receipts when I need them, and have it as a inexpensive backup. Backups are really important."
1,"Got this for my fiancé and she loves how easy it is to use, and how light the product is. Would highly recommend to all book readers."
1,This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !
1,He and his wife are delighted with it and the acess to the huge number of books available.
1,I can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them.
1,I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps
1,This kindle is the lightest one yet. Easy to operate and great to carry on planes.
1,"I have several generations of Kindle readers, and this is far and away the best. It is relatively expensive, but the features are worth it."
1,"This is my second Kindle. It's small, easy to hold, and fits in my backpack when travelling. Now I can read in any kind of light."
1,"Great for reading books, news, email, TV, music...and games. A wonderful device that is light enough to carry anywhere. Especially good for travel. Easy to carry and get through airport security. Can use on the plane. An easy and inexpensive gateway to computer literacy for older folks."
1,"I purchased this item not to play games, but to use as a search tools and read newspapers and books . Works perfectly. Great Price for Xams."
1,"This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand."
1,My 4 year old daughter loves her fire for kids. Keeps her very entertained at all times
1,I am enjoying My Echo. It is more helpful then I thought it would be. I am happy with my purchase.
1,Great for everyday use! Price is right! Easy to setup & use!
1,"Amazon echo is pretty cool. I'm a gadget guy so I enjoy technology like this. Alexa reads the news, weather, turns my lights on and off, plays music, makes shopping lists, etc. My only complaint is that to make a shopping list, you have to keep saying Alexa...""Alexa, add milk to the shopping list."" ""Alexa, add bread to the shopping list."" ""Alexa, add rice to the shopping list."" And so on. So if you have to make a long list, it's a little tedious, but overall, I really like her."
1,It has been one of the best things I've seen in its great
1,"I have wanted one of these since they first launched. My children uses it as well by playing songs, daily words, jokes, etc. The technology is so amazing I also ordered Echo Show and I used it to make video calls. The sound is quite impressive and the range of the microphones is surprising."
1,"Long battery life, holds thousands of books so it saves space. Fits in most pocketbooks so you can take with you everywhere. Glad I purchased it. Easier to read than the regular kindle."
1,This item is awesome for streaming movies or sports
1,This was a wonderful gift for my grand child ..parental control is wonderful option
1,"This is a very capable player. It is comparable to the Roku 4 or AppleTV. There are a few caveats though. The device works best if you have Amazon account, preferably an Amazon Prime account. It allows you to access the Amazon Video library, download apps, and use Alexa voice search. Unfortunately, there is an additional annual fee for the service. There is a free option, but it limits the ability of the device. The device also lacks true YouTube support. You're redirected to a website like interface to view videos. With YouTube beginning to roll out 4K content, it makes you wonder why this device doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app to showcase the 4K ability. If you have an Amazon Prime account, this device works very well. Otherwise, I would recommend doing some research, such as looking at the Roku 4, which has a more well-rounded set of features."
1,Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it
1,I bought this for a retirement gift and my coworker loves it. It's perfect! Easy to set up and no hassles.
1,Great device that simplifies many things. Mostly understands what I say even without training it.
1,Bought for my office and I'm very well pleased! Very simple setup. Easily connects with my cell phone. Voice commands have worked wonderfully!
1,I got the ECHO DOT also. I compared them both and decided to keep the DOT. They are the same except for the speakers and the price. I would still highly recommend the ECHO. It's a personal choice.
1,Great product compact and easy to get around in. Was able to download almost all my favorite apps
1,The tv has the same functionality as my stick. The program choices are excellent.
1,"I thought the Firestick was the way to go but the lack of buffering from the tv box is all i need to watch everything with no worry of it stopping or cutting off, if you don't have one you need to get one asap!!!!"
1,Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.
1,I just enjoy and find it easier to read on this than my iPad. I replaced my old Gen 1 Kindle Fire and this doesn't disappoint.
1,"The new kindle is a much better experience. It is lightweight, the back light and ink make reading easy. The internet connection is smooth and fast"
1,I brought this tablet for my granddaughter she played her brothers and I want her to have one
1,"If you are looking for a reader that is just a bit more than a reader this is the right product. I bought this for my wife so she would stop trying to read on her small phone, and she absolutely loves it. Battery life is good, build quality is great, for the price there is really no comparison."
1,"The Echo is and has the potential to completely change our way of doing things in our home. From music to grocery lists, to calendar events and home security. We are just beginning to explore the many capabilities of this product and we are enjoying every minute of it."
1,"got this because where i work we are not allowed anything with a camera.this was perfect,can read for hours with little strain on my eyes."
1,works great for kids bought three for Christmas no complaints
1,This is a great and convenient tablet at an unbeatable price.buy one before all gone
1,Bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter because of the price. I may go back and get myself one. It takes great pictures. And it is easy to use.
1,"I bought my wife one, she bought me one a few weeks later and now I'm going to buy my mamma one. Great on the go, take to work and business trip device. My little girl loves learning on the kids ABC and coloring app!"
1,Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly!
1,Works well but much better when the tv is not on. Great apps
1,"Bought two for grandkids so they might read more and it has worked. They enjoy carrying them when traveling also, takings books wherever they go"
1,I buy this tablet for my kid for Christmas he really like it
1,At this moment perfect and close to book eReader in todays world. Your eyes won't harm you. Nice deal in Bestbuy
1,"This is perfect for what I wanted to do - which is read! I have a tablet for other things. I love how lightweight it is, the backlight, long battery life and no-glare in sun. I highly recommend!"
1,"I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night."
1,A good computer device to use when traveling at a fair price.
1,I use this mainly to watch movies on amazon and netflix. Great addition to my household.
1,"So far I like it, but wish the App Store had the game I play. I haven't done anything else but read so can't comment on other things."
0,I will never buy this again very cheap not with a dime
1,This is a very good product and excited to use it.
1,My grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!
1,Amazon Fire Tv is a must if you have Amazon Prime.
1,Love it I wish it would have worked with my iPhone Overall very satisfied
1,"Great tablet, so affordable and an awesome service!"
1,My daughter loves this. There are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. So many books and educational apps :)
1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.
1,"In an effort to simply and cut down on the number of books I shelve and store I bought the paper white Kindle by Amazon. I had previously owned a Fire and it fatigued my eyes after reading and like my books ended up on a shelf. My parents swear by their Kindle Paper White's and so I decided to give it a try!I Love IT! Easy to read, easy on the eyes, I can read it in bed without keeping my wife awake, super lite and the battery lasts forever!"
1,"I have a smart tv but the speed with which the apps work leaves a lot to be desired. I bought the Amazon Fire tv because having Amazon prime allows me to watch tons of shows and movies for free and the selection of available apps is great. The only drawback I noticed is that Vudu cannot be installed but I do have that on my smart tv so it's not a big issue. The remote of the Fire tv works via bluetooth so the box can be hidden away and out of sight which is great. Overall, a very solid streaming box."
1,"I love my Kindle Paper White and the versatility of it. I can read it inside, at night in bed, or outside sitting in my swing with the sun shining brightly. It is very light and easy to hold. I also like the size of it and how it fits in my purse so I can take it with me wherever I go!"
1,I had the fire tv stick first and was told the fire tv was better so I knew I had to have one. I honestly haven't watched a lot of fire tv yet but I plan on it and I love the picture quality and the fact that I can watch movies on prime and all of that.
1,"It took a moment to figure out how to set it up, but once that was complete, it works amazingly. It is a little smaller than I prefer."
1,I got this smaller kindle for my kids and I loved it and so did they!
1,Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money.
1,"great reader, no glare. Love my iPad, but this is great if you don't want the glare from light. After using this product it is not as quick as an iPad."
1,Love this product will buy again this product is smooth and fast
1,Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle.
1,solid product to use.use it for reading and answering email.
1,Left the Barnes & Noble nook because Amazon has way more options and so far glad I'm changed e-readers!
1,Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.
1,Everyone we know who bought echo has loved it. We are looking forward to learning all it can do! So far so good with ease of use.
1,I was not sure if this product could do all that it is capable. very good quality with excellent sound quality.
1,It's a fine tablet for the price the only problem I have with theach kids mode it's not what I was thought it's going to be I returned it back just be of this reason
1,Birthday gifts for both of my teenagers. They can do the social media that they enjoy and complete things for school and they love the camera!
1,"Amazon Echo is so incredibly cool. The only thing that would make it better would be if I could call it Jarvis when I speak to it. I would totally feel like Iron Man. Once you setup your iHeart Radio, Pandora Jam and Amazon Prime - your music possibilities are endless. It will also give you news headlines, weather, wake up alarms, etc. You can teach it skills such as telling jokes, random pick up lines or even pootering on demand. My kids love that it has a quite extensive poot library. (something I never thought i'd say) One warning! It gets expensive quick. I had it two days and was already back at Best Buy buying a Phillips Hue Starter Kit so I could control my bedroom lights by voice. Not mention that you can order using Amazon Prime by voice. Although some setup to do so is required. As far as the overall initial configuration is very easy. The sound is very good and it makes a great blue tooth speaker as well."
1,VERY HAPPY WITH STREAMING CHOICE. THE FIRESTICK TV
1,I absolutely love my Kindle Paperwhite. I especially love the fact that the light doesn't bother my husband at night while I am reading in bed.
1,"Everyone should have one of these in their home. My kids use it to assist with homework from spelling to math. I use it to get daily updates on news, traffic and weather. With this product, the future is now!"
1,This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage
1,This is a very affordable tablet for the kiddos! We bought the Amazon foam cover and it seems very protected in it.
1,"I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great."
1,Very easy to install. Got all I want and if you like apps you love this.
1,I really like the price and quality of the product
1,This is an excellent product. The use of this new technology is great...looking forward to more upgrades.
1,Awesome device for my six year old. Very safe useage
1,"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
1,this is a great product best on the market will recommend
1,"I like to get library books, but just have a super hard time getting them on my Kindle. I finally get it done, but it is such a task because I don't know what to do. Other than that, I really like the Kindle as I can read in bed without turning on the light and I can also read outside in the sun. How great is that!!! I love it. Now, I just need to read how to accomplish the chore at hand---getting library books."
1,"We use it everyday! We love it! It is a vital part of our day. From asking traffic routes, grocery list to weather. We'd be lost without it."
1,I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
1,Isn't a cheat and easy to break tablet and has just enough of all the apps for me
0,"Cheap tablet for price, for a kid or an older person that might not know how to use it."
1,its does everything it says with no problems only wish it was waterproof
1,We like the Echo and use it daily. Have not set up completely.
1,"Good tablet for the price, it's gonna be a good present."
1,Great product. Works perfectly. I would buy it again.
1,Gift for the wife was a hit. I was in and out of Best Buy in minutes. Great experience.
1,It's a good buy compared to google home Over all I'm happy I bought this
0,Lol.... the only reason i bought this tablet was so i could load my games from my phone and play them on larger screen but i didnt realize that sonce its an amazon product it wont load google play or support vlash of clans or any other google game a big thumbs down.... i guess im just stuck with a tablet that is useless for me
1,SO simple and easy to u se. It answers a multitude of questions and plays my favorite music. Portable and unobtrusive when not in use.
1,I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing
1,"I've had this for about a month and so far, it's all good. The remote that I can speak into is cool and most of what I say is recognized correctly by Alexa. I like that I can place Amazon orders this way if I feel the need. The only con, as of now, is that the battery cover is hard as h&ll to get off."
1,Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!!
1,I wanted a different gadget with a unique featured searchshopp and reading capacity.
1,I bought this for my son's first tablet. I really like the product. Like the parental controls. For him I am not thrilled that with any parental controls he can't have free access to the web. It's blocked mostly :(.Needs a bit more memory so get an SD card. I would rate it lower because of this. But for what I paid I just cant. The graphics on Netflix are good. I can't come up with one reason for the price to give it less than stars. I own a IPAD and it rivals it. Especially for the price difference.
1,"Great as a digital assistant--music, grocery lists, etc. But Alexa is no Google, that's for sure. For my uses, it's just fine. Supposedly, Alexa keeps getting ""smarter"" so this should improve, but it's not there yet."
1,Fantastic product for streaming online content. Great for gaming.
1,Great price for a decent tablet. Amazon hit it out the park with this tablet.
1,Great tablet for reading and the ocassional surfing. It plays videos well from Amazon prime and the display is pretty nice. A great addition is the blue filter for night reading. I bought two.
1,The Amazon Echo is like Star Trek for the home because the Echo does what you command with your voice and new features are being added all the time. I like the size of the speaker and it has good sound too :-)
1,Great for kids and adults looking for a quick tablet. Was surprised at how fast it downloads games and etc.
1,"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
1,Family enjoying asking questions and listening to music
1,I have two fire tv boxes and they work great. I pluged my direct into the router with a patch cable for very fast speed. The wifi is also very strong and works great. Love the optional storage slot for a flash card.
1,It is extremely light weight and easy to carry around. Great resolution. I also purchased the protective cover.
1,This is a great tablet for kids. Its got great parental controls and its easy for the kids to use. I even enjoy playing angry birds on it
1,The Kindle Fire is a great value doing most of what more expensive tablets do for a great price.
1,I like the Kindle Paperwhite. It's very convenient for me to read books and other study materials.The built-in backlight makes it simple to read at night! Like it!
1,"First, this is a great product. Seriously there is no reason not to own one of these. If you have an Amazon Prime account it is almost a must have. Setup is simple and once you add some of the skills to Alexa it's a whole lot of fun. We have a Wemo light switch that it controls, now that setup was a bit more challenging but nothing you can't get through. Plays any radio station, must genre, tells you the weather, helps with timers in the kitchen and the shopping list function is a huge help. Let's talk about the shopping list a little. You just tell Alexa what you want to add to your list and it will all appear in list form on your mobile device in the Alexa app as a check-off list. I'll give you one downside. Alexa seems to think the CNN news reporters are talking to her as they wake her up a lot."
1,"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
1,I originally bought this tablet for myself. But my kids quickly saw the appeal and started using it. It's been a great purchase and my kids have had a lot of fun with it. And the prices is really unbeatable.
1,This is fun to use. I'm not good with electronics but decided to try this to help organize my life and it does the job.
1,"This tablet is very affordable and has more then enough things to do on it. Has features more expensive tablets have at a fraction of the cost. If something were to happen to it,it wouldn't be a crazy tragedy due to the price it is listed at."
1,I have been very satisfied with my new kindle and use it almost every day!
1,"I am very satisfied with the Amazon TV. While I have used an Amazon Firestick, I bought this unit primarily because of the ethernet connection in order to get a faster streaming speed while watching TV shows and movies. Another nice feature is the USB connection. It makes it very easy to view and listen to music audios, videos and photos on a thumb drive.I recommend it to anyone who has internet hardwire options available."
1,This replaced a paper white that was several years old and acting up. I love the paper whites because I can read them anytime anywhere.
1,Just what my kids needed for a road trip. Easy to setup. Love it
1,It's a gift for my Mother-in-Law and she's very happy with it!
1,This item makes a great gift. It's small and very affordable compared to other 7 inch tablets. Navigating the tablet and closing apps are a bit of a learning curve.
1,"First we purchased the Firestick that ran off of wifi only...ours was too far away from the router and was buffering all the time. Close-by it worked great, but we upgraded to connect directly and we've had no problems. Wonderful product and serves our needs...the voice command for questions is a nice feature as well."
1,Makes accessibility to lighting and music very easy. Enjoying learning all the Alexa can do.
1,"Easy to use for my non-tech sister! Screen is a little small, but it works for what she needs. Great value on ""Black Friday."""
1,Great item for book readers. Very happy with purchase as i love to read.
1,I have only had this for a short time but it is great! Even our 3 year old Nephew enjoys it!
1,"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
1,"It makes it the perfect gift,Not too big,Not too small...perfect"
1,got this on black friday and couldn't be any happier! for 35 bucks and its a kindle my kids will be super excited.
1,"Fire TV helps me navigate several viewing sources which helped me end my relationship with my satellite provider. I'm now spending $35 per month & have access to sports, movies, etc."
1,Amazon has a great product with their Kindle Fire tablets. Much more affordable than an Apple IPad. This particular one was purchased on a black Friday sale at an unbelievable price. We are very pleased with this purchase.
1,Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.
1,Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool
1,The only drawback is that this tablet does not have access to all apps. Other than that it is a great product.
1,Bought this for my 8 year old daughter so that I could get my iPad back. The biggest feature that I like is the ability to control her content and screen time. Some apps that she has on the iPad aren't available on the Fire but it does enough to keep her satisfied. This is a good entry level tablet for a kid.
1,Great! It's very good. I will buy it next time. Thanks.
1,Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.
1,"love this tablet, I would so recommend this for others"
1,Works very well for my new Kindle.
1,This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.
1,"After reading various reviews for different streaming devices I went with the Amazon Fire box. Once I purchased the fire, I want on line and went through a number of you tubes to find the easiest downloads. This device works great. I am enjoying many different programs that my cable does not have."
1,I love my fire TV it's an amazing product I liked it so much I went out and bought fire sticks for the rest of the TVs in my house
0,"I purchased it to see if the stream speed would be quicker than my Amazon Firestick but was disappointed.The stream speed is at the mercy of your internet provider.The processing speed is faster than the Firestick but in the end it has the same memory as the Firestick.For the price, the Amazon Firestick is better if all you do is stream... It might be a good fit for gamers."
1,I love this device! Its very easy to use and makes cable irrelevant.
1,"Perfect size, works great, great streaming quality."
1,Love the ease of use and all the things it will do!
1,"Highly recommend buying this product. We were purchasing cable through our cable co. and paying nearly $200 for a bundled plan. And we hardly have time to even watch live television! But with this device we are able to catch up on programs, series, news and our favorite movies at our leisure and pause and pick up whenever we want. And after searching other sites and stores we found that Best Buy has the best price overall. And super great customer service as well."
1,I bought this for my son and he loves it. Actually the whole family uses it.
1,This tablet works well for me. I use it mainly for checking my email instead of having to log in into my computer all the time. I don't have a smartphone so it is perfect for me.
1,"We have always been Nexus Tablet desciples, and in fact have bought 6-8 of them for self and family members. This one was for granddaughter to replace Nexus that had gotten slow.This one works better/faster than the Nexus! It's fast....easy to use; perfect tablet for a child or teenager...and can't beat the price!Very pleased with purchase...."
1,"I've had the Fire Stick version of the Fire TV for quite a while, but finally went for the more powerful unit. This little guy is great, does a fine job of bringing in the Amazon offerings as well as playing some casual games (we tried some trivia and other simple games). The voice control is excellent. Overall I am very pleased with this unit. If I had to come up with something they could improve, it would be the feel of the remote. It has a bit of a fragile/flimsy feel to it."
1,"Great tablet for kids and adult, it had parental control as well as amazon apps"
1,I am so happy I bought this I have firestick also and love to stream Netflix works amazing and much faster than firestick
1,Echo is my favorite music device. Great sound and look.
1,"Good for travel, easy to use and long battery power."
0,Nothing special just okay
1,This item has worked well and is a great addition to our home. Very easy to get information. I also hope to align it with some smart home functionality soon.
1,So much faster then the stick. Worth the extra money
1,"Alexa is a great device to have around the house. You can conveniently add things to your shopping or to-do list or get a quick snapshot of the news and weather. Alexa has fun features like playing jeopardy and 20 questions. The only downside is she is not connected to the internet, so you can't get answer to random questions, like if you were asking Siri. Hopefully that feature will come soon!"
1,Awesome device!! I used to have an iPad mini and really expected to be disappointed by the fire. I'm not. Not at all. It is great and does everything I want it to do.
1,My husband wanted the fire box and we are glad we got it.
1,Good and easy. The kids love it and use it for learning and games.
1,He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count
1,This works great for my Kindle
1,I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.
1,The echo is a great addition to our household. We love it so much we give them as gifts to our friends who don't already have it!!
1,"I purchase this product to give it away as a gift, good product overall"
1,"Found this device to be one of the best streamers on the market with Ethernet. Also have an Apple 3rd generation and enjoy this more because of the availability of apps that I cannot get on the Apple device (Amazon Prime, PlayStation Vue)."
1,Works very well. I do ish it had some of the features of the Google. Picked this one cause it can have three accounts at one time.
1,"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have."
1,"I had a tough time finding reviews for this version of the Tamron. Read several reviews comparing the Nikon and the Sigma equivalents to this lens' previous version. The main draw back for the original Tamron 600mm was some design issues like lack of weather proofing. All those seem to be addressed from what I can see and have read. I have not done a high end performance test with color charts dissecting every bit of pixel like some articles I read. I can say that it works very well and the detail I get with my D810 is incredible. I took the below shot at the zoo. The weight can be off putting to some people but that comes with the territory of any large lens and I don't see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it comes to weight. If you are like me and have been eyeing this lens for a while and over researching, do yourself a favor and just go out and get it. You wont be disappointed."
0,Waste of money
1,"I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!"
0,Fire TV was just about equal to the nexus player. and it it more expensive
1,I really liked this tablet. Got it for my nephew who just turned 4. Has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained. The bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too. What I also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too.
1,"If you're looking to cut the cord, this streaming box has you covered. This box has the best app support and works with all the top services on the market. Good remote with app support built in"
1,Awesome tablet it's fast and easy to use. Affordable can't find any better at this price
1,"Price was great, tablet not the fastest but easily works with my echo and Amazon Prime."
0,I like the kindle it is light and easy too sue battery life is good.
1,"I love it so much! Easy to navigate, perfect size screen! Very happy!!!"
1,This Fire tablet was worth every penny of the $35 price tag on Black Friday. We bought 6 of them as gifts and should've bought 6 more. I could've handed them out to a few others that were jealous. Lol
1,It is just like reading a book only it's way more convenient! The background has the same look as the pages of a real book.
1,"This is a great device for controlling your smart home. We ended up returning this for Google Home because Google's voice assistant understands my questions better and usually always has an answer, unlike Alexa who wants you to check the app"
0,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good."
1,I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
1,"We use Alexa with our Hue system to control our lights. We never manually turn on our lights anymore-- ""Alexa-- Family room on!"" It's fantastics.It's great to ask questions and play music. Our family loves it."
1,"I was iffy about choosing between this kindle and the newer one. This kindle has gotten me to read more and I love it. That's why I bought it. No flaws in it, exactly what I wanted!"
1,My moth in law loved it. It was a great tablet for her!
1,"This tablet is great - the size is just right for carrying it in your purse or backpack. The clarity of the screen is very good. You can play games, access email, search the web, etc. Would recommend to a new purchaser."
1,I just wanted something to carry in my purse for not a lot of money. This is perfect. Just jump on wifi and check emails or keep up with my books.
1,"I had a kindle Paperwhite that I'd bought in summer 2014, and by summer 2015 something had gone funky- it wasn't charging anymore. So I upgraded to one with a higher PPI a couple months ago. The difference is slight; in fact I haven't noticed it at all. If I went back to my old Kindle I'd probably notice that the quality had changed, but really, it's a very minor upgrade. But that doesn't matter- because the Paperwhite is awesome anyway! I am a woman, and I can fit it in the back pocket of most of my jeans (so dudes definitely can), it slips into small purses and it holds a charge for weeks. I have a pretty big collection of physical books, but I really enjoy having a library on a tablet that I can bring with me too. I buy physical books when I want to linger around a book store, or for poetry, or books that I want to high light or share with people, or that I like the covers of. I buy Kindle books that I really want for the story, or that are on sale on the Kindle store, or classics that are cheap (a couple bucks) or free. The Vocabulary Builder is really nice- I just highlight and lookup words that I want to know more about, then it provides a definition for me and saves the word as a flash card so that I can practice later at my convenience. I use my Kindle at night- the back light is perfect for reading right before bed. I wholeheartedly recommend this device if you just want a reading tablet. I might get another tablet for watching TV or playing games, but I just wanted a dedicated reading one, and this is perfect for me."
1,Great price and product is very good ..I will recommend anyone
1,"My family and I constantly use Alexa to listen to music, help with cooking, check the weather, help with homework and listen to the news. One of my favorite purchases ever."
1,Great product for an age of streaming tv! Very little maintenance and setup
1,"This tablet was a gift for my office's white elephant exchange. Also bought one for my boyfriend. Great, inexpensive tablet for Amazon centric people."
1,We purchased this tablet for our niece and it works fantastic!
1,"convenience with alexa is changing my home, setting it up with light bulbs thermostats, audio radio...best investment ever."
1,Best thing to replace Att U450. No more pricey cable bills
1,The Echo responds surprisingly well to my commands. Great for music on Prime and Pandora
1,Easy to set up and useEasy to read even in sunlight No artificial light needed in the dark Very portable. Fits in purse
1,This product has surpassed all of my expectations for these add on tv devices. I originally had a Roku and I have to say this is 10 times better. You won't regret purchasing it.
1,Needed a table to use for reading Kindle books. This one works great. I also purchased on for my daughter. Good selection of games that my grand daughter can play.
1,Like having a charger specific for the kindle since only the cable comes with the kindle.
1,My kids (10 & 11) both got one of these for Christmas and they have been attached to it since opening it. Great for all the games they like and watching Netflix and it was a fairly priced device which are all the reasons we got them. Not sure if it has everything an adult would want in a mobile device since I didn't get it for me but my kids sure do seem to love it so I can definitely say I recommend this for a young child.
1,Tons of movies and all the sports you want. No more cable
1,"Excellent for educational tool, during party and get together, with no pc available"
1,"Set up was simple and was very pleased with the picture quality that streamed to the tv and since you can watch Amazon Prime movies, even better"
1,Great option to take your library on the go without multiple distractions that come with a tablet.
1,Great aesthetic look and performs well. You have to read what Alexa can connect to. Worth buying at Best Buy.
1,"I enjoy my kindle tv, it beats paying for cable every month ������"
1,"novelty products ala Siri, provides information on the spot. make sure that a wireless high speed internet connection is available or it will generate a great degree of frustration"
1,"I did not think I would prefer an Ereader to an actual book, but I do. It is easy to read, easy to pause, east to start back. I do feel that it is a little awkward to hold and ill be ordering a leather cover case."
1,Purchased this for my mother as a gift. she uses mainly Apple products so there was an adjustment to switch over to Amazon apps. If you aren't familiar with Amazon then this may be an adjustment from Google or Apple. Good for beginners and the price. I liked that there was use for additional storage for a Mini-SD so hopefully I can store movies on there for her.
1,Great for controlling smart link devices and playing music that you want to hear. Great up to the minute news info.
1,This is a nice little tablet for a beginner. Can't beat $35.00!
1,"Alexa has been a great addition to our household. She is simple to connect and easy to use. We use her daily to keep us informed about current event, enjoy her music and have connected several devises to her to make our house smarter."
1,"i was a little concerned how small it was, but the size is perfect. the back lighting is great for when it is darker plus it works well in sun light as well. the touch page turn is easy."
1,"Originally I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds. They loved it and so did I. So many things to do on them and so much of what they love. I now got it as well for my 2 year old. The best part of it all is the cases come with the tablets and they have 3 colors to choose from, so perfect for me."
1,Product works well but you have to put in all the product knowledge yourself and put the things you want it to know . I thought it did all of that by itself . But there are thousands of things you can enable for it to do. And it's very sensitive when your speaking to it and also will come on by itself from the TV. Not an expert yet and maybe those settings can be adjusted
1,Very Good. Second purchase. Purchased as a Christmas gift. I recommend Amazon as a good product and would purchase again especially at a discount
1,"I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks."
1,"This is my first e-reader ever and it's AMAZING. the text is so crisp there is not a pixel to be seen. The device is fast, and I haven't seen any problems in my last 1-2 months of owning it. Battery life is decent - I use the backlight a lot so it doesn't last as long as it would without - but it's still great. I love how you can borrow ebooks from Overdrive and download them on your kindle, easy peasy. Kindle Unlimited offers a good selection of free books for a monthly fee, and there is a 30-day free trial. Overall an AMAZING e-reader. Skip the cheaper version without the backlight - you're gonna need it."
1,The Echo does everything. I love it. They add new apps often. :)
1,My grandson loves i. He takes it everywhere with him and he never leaves it
0,The table is good for someone that just need some entertainment and make amazon purchases
1,Bought as holiday gifts for older kids. They loved them. I helped set up and you can tell the quality of the product by the way it feels in your hands. Very quick processing. Suggest buying micro sd cards for additional storage space. 8GB isn't much.
1,Bought it for Chistmas gift for daughter in-law. She loves it and i even got a better price than Amazon and AVAILABLE in store before Christmas!
1,This works as advertised...I use it every day.Sounds great...quality made.It's like having another family member.So glad we got it!
1,"My wife and I both love our Kindles, easy to use and easy on the eyes. Much better than reading on a normal tablet."
1,Great tablet. Easy to use. Purchased as a gift for a family member.
1,I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!!
0,"Amazon echo dosent hear well when the music is on full blast, but when you do get thru she's very acurate ."
1,best media player under 100$amazon is the best!!!
1,Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!!
1,Love it working great on my 4kTV real easy to use.
1,We bought this to download movies and books onto for a long plane ride. It worked great! Very happy with the purchase.
1,"For the price, its really a nice little device...."
1,"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there."
1,I have owned the fire stick for a few months when I decided to upgrade my TV to 4K and when I did I also upgraded to this Fire TV. It is a. Ice upgrade from the stick picture quality is great (may be the new tv) also runs faster and smoother.
1,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO YOU. This product is really light and portable. You can carry it to caf or library for reading. There is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. The only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. But this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. I think it is acceptable. I bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. So it really worth it.
1,Bought on Black Friday for at a decent discount. Would be a really nice product if I were an Amazon Prome member.
1,"Echo works great. It provides good sound for a small system. Bluetooth setup/use can be somewhat annoying depending on what you're trying to connect. However there are always updates, and it gets smarter all the time."
1,Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
1,Great way to get awesome content without having cable. HIGHLY recommended but not for beginners UNLESS you are good with YouTube.
1,It is a joy to read. I love the nonglare. The size. Everything about it.
0,"Worked fine for a month, then refused to take a charge. Returned to best buy, and advised that amazon like to handle their own warranty issues. Stuck with a store credit card. I suppose it will get used, but not impressed with the product at all"
1,"Bought four of these for grandkids. Suitable for adults, super fast, great operating system."
1,It is a good tablet for kids wish it would be a little better with games
1,Bought 2 Fire tablets so my boys would not be starng at their iPhones for games. They were thrilled!
1,"I purchased this tablet after seeing the Best Buy ad...I got it for my wife for Christmas this past December. The price was unbelievable (under $50!) and even though my wife didn't think she'd ever use or want one, I said, ""What the heck!"" and bought it anyway. Well, she's been using it nightly (during the week) and quite a bit more on weekends--in fact, she's used it more than anything else I've ever given her in the past!"
1,Our children tend to forget to get gentle with the kindle so the replacement plan is great. And I don't have to worry about the wrong kind of content popping up. It's a relief.
1,Bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas she is going to love it I've already downloaded a bunch of book and apps for her so it will be all set for Christmas morning
1,Pleasantly surprised with the Amazon Fire tablet! Have used many apps on it and the dang thing works like a charm. For that low of a price I really think I got my money's worth out of it. It's great for watching Hulu and Netflix and Amazon prime of course.
1,It works well and can be hooked up with spotify to make it fun
1,Got as a Christmas gift for my aunt and she loves it would highly recommend she thought she would just use it for books but now she is even using it for games and apps
1,this tablet works great for note taking at school.
0,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users."
1,"This is a review for the echo itself since you can't leave a review for it yet. I received my echo March 24, 2015 and i love it! I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more"
1,"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
1,Set up was automatic. I really didn't need to know anything specific. Just follow the prompts. Really great for my kids.
1,I have already got 2 from Best Buy before this is my third one
1,I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
1,My grandson loves it. Will be getting another one.
1,Love it very easy to use and easy to install and run on tv
1,Good products and service and happy with Amazon Fire Tablet
1,"Instead of buying books, it made more sense to use this Kindle as our library for the kids."
1,Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.
0,"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
1,"Santa got this for my 7year old. Work's great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn't bother me to use my electronic devices ."
1,Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it.
1,"I couldn't be happier with Amazon Fire TV! I had purchased the Fire stick first to try out. It, as well as Fire TV, are a breeze to install...fast, easy, and amazing. I have the voice remotes on all of them and it makes navigating outstanding. I'm using the Fire Stick on my bedroom TV and the Fire TV on my flat screen in the family room. The main difference is that the Fire TV has a greater memory capacity than the Stick. It comes with a lot of free films, programs, games (unlike the other streaming services), music for Prime members. The options available to kids (from toddlers to grade schoolers), are incredible and include both games and videos. It allows you to keep a personal ""Watchlist"" for those things that are you faves or that you want to come back to at a later date. There's so much available with this that I can't say enough about it. It also has all the subscription services that you can test with the free trials that they offer: Sling, Hulu, HBO, Starz, and much, much more. That way, if you're really looking to cut the cable, you get a great feel as to what's out there and how much it will cost should you pick a paid service. Even if you just stick with what Amazon offers freely (and they add things all the time) you still would only be paying for the Fire TV and nothing more. Definitely a win/win for those who are fed up with being gouged over and over by digital services. With this, all you'll need is wifi, and a TV with HDMI ports....and you'll be good to go."
1,"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
0,It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.
1,This is an excellent product at an excellent price
1,"Fun to use for recipes, conversions while cooking, weather and more fun for the whole family"
1,It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
1,Great purchase!!!! Allowed me to cut my cable off!
1,Great sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the Alexa feature I listen to Kindle books that are not available as audio books
1,"We purchased this for our son who starts school next year. This is a great upgrade from his Nabi. My only complaint would be the memory, or lack there of. It is expandable so I highly recommend a micro SD."
1,Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone.
1,My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!
1,"This is a great tablet and you can't beat the price. I bought it to use with Amazon Prime Videos, but I now find myself using it for much more. The built in email client works great. If you want, and do a little research, it is easy to either side load apps from the Google PlayStore, or install the store app itself, allowing you to install the few apps that don't appear in the Amazon App Store."
1,"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
1,Great tablet for my three year old son It's really easy for him to use
1,"Got it during black Friday weekend at a great price, works good no problems with them."
1,Perfect gift. My family love it! Have one in each of the rooms.
1,The tablet works just great and the price can't be beat!
1,Very easy to use. Very responsive. It's like having a floating computer in your house. Ask it anything and ask it to do most anything online..order pizza etc. Very cool
1,Research all the skills that Alexa has. You wouldn't believe what she can do.
1,"This tablet is excellent when you are an on-the-go person. You not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. You will not have to lug a big book with you if youre out and about. I have never had a tablet where books can be downloaded onto it (and its free). I am one satisfied customer!"
0,"Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services."
1,This is a great tablet for the money. It gets 4 stars because there are some things that could be better. The tablet has some lag to it at times while trying to perform some operations. However reading books or watching videos is great once the connection establishes. If you understand that it's not gonna act like a more expensive feature filled tablet this is great.
1,Perfect Tablet for our Son we bought it for his 9th Birthday it works great and he couldn't be happier great Tablet.
1,"Nice, simple great deal for the money. Good buy, would recommend."
1,Is a good product but I will like to know more about it
1,Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.
1,Echo is great for quick question and very entertaining for my son he is always coming up with questions for Alexa. The last thing I do before walking out the door every day is ; Alexa what is the weather and traffic today? Technology today gotta love it.
1,"Gave as a gift.Did not know you had to ""tap"" it before you talk. Thought it was like echo.Anyway, they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk.Really likes that it is battery powered, portable."
1,Much smaller and lighter weight than my old kindle. Menus are easy to navigate and screens are easy to see. Battery seems to last a long time too. Love it!!
0,"Item was DOA. Reached out to Amazon IT who this happens often. I stand gratification was thrown straight out the window. I returned the item to BB where I purchased the Appel tv. Much better product and works, which is more than I can say for the Fire TV. I give the item a 2 star instead of a 1 because Amazons IT was quick to answer the phone and troubleshoot."
1,"I wanted a cheap e-reader that I could use also as an Android tablet if I wanted to. This fitted the bill, especially as a daily deal. It does what I wanted it to and at a very good price."
1,We're really enjoying it. The price was right. Great 4 a beginner
1,Large enough it is not a strain on my child's eyes. In two days my three year old figured it out. Great for her to watch her shows and play games. Have not used it much past setting it up.
1,Works great we are Amazon prime so love the shows ! I am using this with wireless .
1,"Great dealing with Best Buy. They are always helpful when I ask questions, and honor all promises."
1,Did not think this would have been as great as I thought it would be. Does so.much and more. Great gift
1,"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
1,"Not the best tablet out there by Amazon, bt definitely worth the price. Can do all the basic functions of an android tablet. Great for media and entertainment purposes."
1,It was everything I expected it to be. Very pleased. I would recommend this product and your store to everyone I know.
1,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand."
1,This has a good stereo making it useful & convenient for anyone who listens to music
1,"Alexa is a great tool for a person to use as a quick guide for information, music and a sense of direction"
1,These were gifts for my grown children for Christmas. They were extremely pleased and loved them. Haven't had their laptops out since receiving these tablets. Very convenient and easy to use.
1,I bought 6 of these 4 for my children & 1 for me and my husband. Very easy to set up and for the money they are the best buy in tablets. My kids use them to do their homework as well as play games; great parent control options.
1,So easy to read. No glare. Lightweight. Best e reader ever
1,This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books.
1,"Bought for my girlfriend so she can stop hoarding books. She's addicted to this now. It's great because it's small and cool looking, but perfect for her because she has immediate access to a plethora of books."
1,This is my 2nd kindle. I had a 2nd generation. The paper white screen clarity is excellent and it's very light.
1,Would highly recommend this product. Offers variety of TV watching.
1,"I had a kindle 2 and liked it for years. The paperwhite is much smaller, but with a bigger screen. The backlight feature is fantastic!"
1,"Easy to set up, works great. Love having music available on command."
1,Bought this item on Black Friday and was going to give it as a gift but kept it for myself. Excellent value!
1,Bought these for my 3 college students. They love them
1,My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old
1,This makes core cutting so easy. So many apps and shows it's almost limitless. Coupled with all the amazon prime content you can go wrong. Easy setup and easy to use
0,good product did care for the remote but product still good
1,We use our echo every day. Don't know what we would do without her.
1,Its a good tablet for that price. screen resolution is also good. I have purchased for my friend.
1,Bought it for Father's Day and my dad and mom love it!
0,"All I can say, as soon as I opened this tablet it never ever turned on, I was so upset as I've followed the troubleshooting steps from other users online and still it never worked, I fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on. I had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item; had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them; they never believed me this item came to be defective; after storming out and after a while; they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for it.I would never buy an Amazon product ever again. piece of junk, bad quality product.Thanks,"
1,"I bought this for one reason, and thats Kodi, its an awesome device for that, and with the sd card reader its easy to install and get up and running, highly recommended"
1,"For what this is, it's great. My 13 year old loves it. You'll definitely need to get an sd card for additional storage; but for the price, it's so worth it! Would be much happier with her breaking this than an expensive tablet!"
1,The quality is great with an affordable price my kids love this product!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Found this product on sale, so I pulled the trigger and picked one up at my local Best Buy. The setup is as easy as plug n play. Comes preloaded with plenty of apps. I was able to connect my Bluetooth keyboard and mouse via the USB input in the back making browsing the Internet a breeze."
1,"Sounds great, easy to use. Love the shopping list feature"
0,Not much of a selection for shows or movies. Hopefully changes
1,I bought it for my daughter. she seems to be entertained.
1,"She really loves using this table, it's easy and simple. Having so much fun playing games. Her Christmas gift was exactly what she wanted. She dropped it a couple of times with no damages."
1,Like always a timely delivery. We have had these items before and we re purchased
1,I am a major reader and love that I can now carry hundreds of books with me so I can read whenever I want.
1,This tablet has proven to be a great durable device for the grand kids. Using them for games and books for school work.
0,"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
1,Great product for playing games and watching movies on the go.
1,Checking e-mail is a breeze. All the apps you could ever want. I don't need my computer anymore.
1,"Great sound, almost perfect interactions and portable. I have the dot and now the tap. The new update allowing voice activation is awesome. Great toy!"
1,"Good tablet for games,adds and imails. Also good size"
1,Bought this even though I have an iPad and an Android tablet. I wanted this so that I wouldn't be easily distracted with other apps. The only thing is that I wish I could inverse the colors for night time. Besides that it has a long battery life and is great for reading books.
1,"Fast response, voice commands are ok but not always accurate. Highly recommend."
1,This was a good buy. Wasn't sure how it would work but we are happy with it.
1,Easy to use. Friendly to the beginner user. Decent camera.
1,Perfect gift for my mom who was homebound after surgery. Made the time go by so much faster!
1,"Alexa can tell you the weather, set cooking timer, tell you recipes, Control the lights in your home, and even play music on your favorite stations."
1,Good value tablet. Better than non brand cheap tablets.
1,I will be buying another Amazon Fire in Feb. for my granddaughter for her birthday.
1,It is a decent tablet. Bought for my 12 year old. He is happy with it. Camera and video could be little better but it is ok.
1,This tablet fits my needs and at $50 the price is right.
1,Got this for my 4 year old. Seems like a great tablet for a young kid to use. I'll edit this after Christmas when I give it to her.
1,like it has a quad core processor but sad it does not have google play store
1,The integration with Crestron Home Automation platform makes the Echo a very useful tool.
1,bought for my kid and it works great. fast enough for movies
0,I bought this charger Nov 28 2015. It's now Jan 1 2016 (a little over a month later) and the device doesn't charge my kindle any longer. I have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours. After I take the charger off and start to use my Kindle within 30 minutes I see the Low Battery message. If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month
1,"This is my 3rd kindle and my 2nd kindle fire. I bought this fire because of the upgrade ability and my 1st fire didn't have that, Before I bought my 1st kindle, I compared all my choices and found this one to be the best for the money and I love my kindle so much I bought on for my daughter , It has a lot more then the original fire did, more Apps can be used, it connects to Goodreads, if you do that, which I do, and it has a camera. It's more like a tablet than just only a e-reader. A little different set up than the original fire but not that hard to get used to, buttons are bigger for the power and the volume, which is a plus."
1,Bought this as an extra tablet for travel & shopping..it is perfect for what I needed smaller than my other tablet but functions almost as well.
1,Solid device that delivers on all advertised specifications. Easy to use both with Amazon and calibre
1,"It's comfortable to hold in my hands, the screen is pleasing to look at and doesn't cause eye strain, the backlight allows me to read at night without being blinded, graphics are crisp when I read a comic, and the long-lasting battery doesn't induce charge anxiety. Also, as a nice surprise, there are countless books, free to borrow via Kindle Unlimited, because I'm a Prime Student member."
1,"Has a slight 'smokey' look at bottom of page. Probably because that is where the ads are shown. Cannot reverse background from white to black. Reversing to white letters on black background creates less glare for night time reading. Amazon is the best for customer service as is Best Buy. Overall, I'm very happy with my Paperwhite. It's very light and now I'll read more. Very user friendly."
1,"Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer"
1,Bought this for my new Kindle since they no longer come with chargers. It's fast and can be used for my phone.
1,Works great as a e reader as well as a tablet. My son loves it.
1,The Amazon Echo is really a great device - very easy to setup and super cool to use.
1,"Great for updating your news and weather every morning, playing music on demand and reminding you what you need to do."
1,Best tablet for my 2 year old son... it has helped a lot and seems to be the most simple kids tablet system available
1,The device has several interesting applications for reading as well as completing necessary tasks for enhanced media.
1,"Great price for the device. Many options, easy to use!"
1,"Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time."
1,Good starter tech equipment for the 8 year old..I am happy with the purchase
1,SuperFun to use.easy set up and great product. ❤❤
1,My old Google Nexus was on it's last legs and I had already changed the USB charge port and things were going south quick. I picked up the Kindle Fire and have been happy ever since.
1,Not needed but convient to use for music and questions. Kids enjoy giving her orders.
1,"The whole reason for getting a Fire stick was to download Kodi TV and additional addons to get streaming movies and TV. I also have a Fire TV for the largest TV in the house, which is faster. Now that it is up and running, I am going to cancel my cable TV and just keep the internet service."
1,Daughter loves it and great customer service! Educational and fun!
1,Great for reading in sunlight. Lightweight and battery lasts a long time!
1,"Bought this for my son, and he ises it all the time."
1,"Small, easy to read, great battery life. Lasts for days. Go buy this."
1,this product went well as a gift and was well excepted and used many times since purchase.
0,Best tablet and most affortable. Love that it just works. Must have Prime.
1,its the best way to watch tv and movies it has everything you need
1,Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
1,it not only is s speaker but also integrates many of the other applications that make your home easier and convenient. so far i have had this echo for aver a month and i am very satisfied with the product.
1,"I first bought the Kindle Paperwhite with the 300dpi screen, I didn't think the jump to the Voyage was worth the $80 plus additional taxes. I read about the Voyage and with Georgia having the back to school tax free days and the e-readers qualifying I returned the Paperwhite and purchased this one. Boy am I glad I did."
0,"This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market."
1,"Bought this for my boyfriend, he LOVES it! He takes it on every trip we go on. It's so powerful for such a small speaker! I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
1,Haven't try used it. It a Christmas present. Updated you later
1,"I liked the first one so much, I went out and bought another one! Love everything about this product. Please ensure you have great internet in order to properly run the services."
1,Product seems to connect to Wi-Fi pretty easily. So far has been pretty durable and held up to a couple of drops. Good picture and it streams games pretty easily
1,Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.
1,"Great home ""assistant"" for the little things that drive you crazy. Still discovering everything Echo can do."
1,"I brought this tablet in December of 2016 for my mother. She uses it regularly now for streaming videos and reading emails. The camera quality is horrible. I would suggest buying another tablet if you want decent pictures. Also, consider that many of the Amazon tablets come with ads as screensavers. To avoid those ads, you can typically pay a one time fee or buy the exact same version for a higher price. Looking back now, I definitely would have given this to my baby brother and brought my mother the newer fire tablet with a bigger screen."
1,good table good resoultion its better than the old table version my kids love it
1,Got this gift for my mother and she's constantly using it. She's fun to use and the speakers are amazing. Considering In getting one for myself. Love this product!
1,"Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
1,"I love how this box allows me to combine my Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and a bunch of other useful hubs in one. It's user friendly and the voice remote is a lifesaver. No more typing in search boxes!"
1,"Easy to use...just what I needed,.... ............."
1,I absolutely love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. My kids and I can't put it down!
1,Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it
1,This is great for using voice control around the house.
1,"I absolutely love this tablet!!! If I had bought this prior to buying my Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, I would have not purchased the e-reader at all, however it's nice to have just a designated e-reader device. The size is perfect! I am actually going to use this device instead of my 17"" laptop to check my emails during the day."
1,I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.
1,Great overall! Pay the money to upgrade over the stick!much faster!
1,Does everything our grandson wants! He rarely puts it down.
1,"at first view I was thinking too much to get or not get this product, but I tried and I love it... Amazon Video is the most amazing video library paying yearly and enjoy at home :) Love this product."
1,Excellent product & amazing things it does. Nice clarity & functionality
1,"Alexa, where have you've been all of my life? I love the Echo. I have one in nearly every room of the house. The sound is amazing and it's great being able to get information, just by asking questions. It even turns my lights on and off."
0,"Worked wonderful and fast the first couple of weeks and then just stopped working. I understand that sometimes things are just a defective piece so I logged into Amazon and attempted to exchange it,, but found out the window for exchanging it had closed. I would have attempted to return it sooner but I was out of state for several weeks visiting and helping my daughter who had just given birth to triplets, and so I'd decided I would just wait till I returned home to do it. By the time I got around to it, it was too late. So I totally wasted my money. If Amazon corrects this matter and send me a replacement, I will update my review."
1,A great product that spares me the hassle of having to boot up my lap top to charge my kindle.
1,Speedy delivery. Item arrived as promised. Great gift for someone who has everything and wants a little fun
1,Bought 4 of them for gifts and 1 for myself. Everyone loved them. Found it easy to install with directions supplied.
1,It is easy for my senior citizen parent to use! Got for her as a gift.
1,This little box should be call a happy box. Once you have sat it up all you have to do is say what you want and it pop up on your tv.
1,I bought this one as a gift but I DO have a couple I keep for the children to play learning games on. They're awesome.
0,"It does everything I need it to do, but the battery life is short lived. I bought it with the intentions to keep my toddler entertained. The battery last about 4 hours, if it runs continuously. If it is intermittent use it lasts about 12 hours. Worth it for the price."
1,Good starter tablet for beginner or child. Good quality for the price.
1,I use the device while riding a stationary bike and elliptical trainer. Perfect for that use. When using it other times I would prefer a larger screen. But this is a very good lower cost item.
1,Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas
1,This is so much faster than the fire stick...highly recommended.
1,great device still needs little quirks worked out to be the device that i truly want it to be but overall great speak and it does its job
1,Got this tablet for $39 dollars. Perfect for travel and kids!
1,Bought this for my daughter before taking a long drive for vacation. Kept charge long enough on a 6 hour drive to keep her entertained! It was very easy to setup and use!
1,My 3 year old love it.. Cool apps and easy to use!
1,"I had this for over 3 months and I'm liking this more and more. It has a lot of potential. 1st of, hardware wise. It's the best of the bunch. It can support up to a 4k display, has an Ethernet port and a microsd slot. It's small and compact so I can tuck it way from sight. This is fast. Virtually little to no lag. Everything is smooth and responsive. If I did have to complain, it's the time to start up the unit from a cold start. 2nd, It's based of of Android so the potential to root and install a media player is a possibility. 3rd, rarely has any buffering issue. Why did I bring this up. It all depends on your provider. When I has FIOS and hardwire the Fire player to the router, it keeps buffering. I don't know why. I have 50 up/down. When I changed providers, TWC/Spectrum, I have Zero buffering issues. To me, I think FIOS is throttling HD contents.To sum it up, this is way better than the stick because of the hard-wiring capabilities. MircoSD slot for expandable and this is freaking fast then the stick. Well worth the extra $30-$40."
1,mainly use it for watching Netflix. Love it. It streams great. I also use it for emails.
1,"Have the gaming version myself but got the normal version for my sister. Can easily load any apps or games you want to run, provided they are android based. Great for streaming with a much higher frame rate then the stick. But the stick works fine for say the kids playroom. Recommend it to anyone looking for a simple and small system. Probably be a go to Christmas give this year."
1,"Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black is great. It has all the entertainment and apps that my family and I need. Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, HBO, Amazon Prime TV, and Movies. It is definitely a fun device for playing a few games, watching movies, etc.... Connects to android game controllers for added fun. I believe it is 4k also."
1,Awesome product! Can do so much with my Kindle! Love it
1,Great tablet for those new to tablets or just goofing around on
1,This was a birthday present and although a friend had talked to me about getting one I had no idea how great it would be to have one. It is easy to set up and we find ourselves asking Alexa questions that we would normally spend the extra time looking up online.
1,"expensive but good with integrated Illumination. has lot of amazon ads, and they asking to buy some new books that ""suitable"" for you! I had the old version with small keyboard and it was with 0 ads.."
1,Got it for 35 on BF.. the tablet is very good ..the processing speed and eveything. The only bummer is Camera but dont use it much
1,"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
1,"Could be faster, gets a little laggy sometimes, but for surfing the net, checking emails, games, books etc, its a great little tablet, and you can't beat the price"
1,Alexa is a must have in every home! Updates at a sound of your voice.
1,This product is amazing! It was an easy set up. Plug and play. And good to go!
0,We bought this for our son. He is rough on electronics. Great price
1,Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling.
1,"I bought this for my son to have access to Netflix and a few games. Although I think the parental controls are too complicated, I really like the tablet."
1,Recommended great electronic. Great for birthday or Christmas
1,It's a great tablet for a beginner or for anyone that has or had a sumsung phone : }
1,My daughter loves her new Kindle. It has all of her favorite games. I love the parental controls of the kindle fires vs. standard Android tablets.
1,We're happy with Alexa. We shuttle it from place to place without a problem. I just had higher expectations but we still enjoy it.
1,Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!
1,This is my first fire. I am enjoying the apps. It was easy to set up. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. I will recommend this product to others.
1,I sometimes have trouble with it understanding my requests.
1,For the price Amazon tv is the best everything that I watch on it comes in 4K . I definitely recommend this product.
0,"It was fun for few weeks until my kids starting asking all sorts of questions to Alexa. Amazon released a smaller version of Echo called Amazon DOT. Which is for half the price of Echo. DOT doesn't have speaker like Echo. But for people who are not playing music through Amazon Echo, DOT might be the way to go"
1,"Bought for a Christmas present for family member, great value."
1,I was confused between Amazon fire and Kindle when buying this as both were in the same price range. But i would say that i made the right choice by picking the specialized Kindle reader. This is the closest experience to actual book-reading and sometimes even more convenient. Would definitely recommend.
1,This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.
1,Good price and like always great servise and waranty
1,My nephew's love the tablets they are great have I lot apps for kids
1,Does what it is supposed to do.
1,The fire tv is great for streaming movies and playing games on
1,The amazon echo is good. It answers questions as asked but needs to be able to look up music without be linked to a specific account
1,"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
1,Bought 2 of these for my kids to have something to play with and watch movies on while traveling. Bought a couple kid proof cases online and they are good to go. Well worth the cheap black Friday price.
1,We're just setting it up now. There is a lot of sinking different apps to Alexa. Doesn't seem to bad though.
1,Really like to read ebooks on the Kindle. The contrast is perfect so there is no strain on the eyes. The smooth feel gives a good user experience.
1,My kids love there Fire. They cannot put it down. They love being able to download books and read them right from their tablet.
1,We were looking for a streaming option in 4K and this one works great. Great picture and sound!
1,Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.
1,Got this as a gift for my grandmother and loaded it with games for her. Simple to use and easy for her once my son showed her the basics.
1,Love my purchases and you should get one as well love it
1,Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.
1,This is my second Amazon Paperwhite eReader. It is superb in bright sunlight or in a dimly lit room.
1,"I bought this one for my wife for Mother's Day and she just loves it. I have had the same for a couple of years and always enjoyed it, and she was borrowing it all the time to read out in the backyard. Now I solved the problem by buying her one of her own. We're both happy."
1,Overall the Amazon Echo was easy to set up and use. It has some really nice features but is much more useful for Amazon Prime members for things such as streaming music.
0,"The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. However it does look rather cheap. For 40 I was expecting a little more.I think I am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.Update November 29th: Tastes will vary, but in the end I decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and I have switched to a different cover (the Splash SAFARI). That is similar to the old Kindle 3 cover, with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap."
1,Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.
1,"Echo is learning everyday and its uses daily, the fact that's it Bluetooth is awesome."
1,"I bought this for my 10 year old grandson. He loves to read, but also play games and watch you tube videos. It's perfect for him."
1,Great device easy to use and easy to read especially in sunlight.
1,"definitely enjoying this. my 5 year old uses Alexa to play all the music he wants. downside is there is no official youtube app or youtube kids. other than that, I dig it."
1,"This paperwhite is just the right size as many paperbacks, but thinner. Can read in any light. Works as advertised!"
1,Purchased as a gift. Works great. We love the kindle paperwhite because it can be read outside with no glare.
1,The item I bought was so great! Best Buy's products are the best!
1,Loved the amazon fire tablet. I bought it as a Christmas present for my 4yo. I bought a case too because as you know kids tend do drop things... this tab was awesome because it linked up with my amazon account and I had control on what my child was viewing. I liked that the price was great and the product is durable. My son thinks it's awesome.
1,"Great add on to any home. Alexia is nice to answer questions, play your music, or about anything you can think of."
1,Echo is very easy to install and it begins immediately. There is no learning curve at all...a fun piece of electronics. I would highly recommend it
1,Awesome. I love to read and I use it everyday. Easy to read at night in dark.
1,"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."
1,Compact. Easy to hold Great for playing games. Easy to use keyboard
1,"very glad I bought this tablet, The price was good and my friends love it"
0,Works fine for what I wanted it for. Using as a remote for my home automation and entertainment system
1,"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house."
1,"The fire tablet works great, does everything my IPad does but cost way less. Awesome tablet to own especially if you like to read books on them"
1,Great for hooking up with Pandora. Needed music in home as swapped out our receiver for a sound bar (also from Best Buy).
1,I love my tablet. It is easy to use and it was ready to go when I turned it on.
1,Is a great first tablet for a beginner or children
1,So far satisfied with product. Have not checked into all capabilities
1,I purchased a Fire in November 2015 holiday sale. I have been enjoying my Fire. A parent of mine purchased a Kindle when the device first came out. I persuaded my parent to buy an updated Kindle because of all the updates in 5 years time. Now she has to learn the newer technology.
1,"Does a great job of playing music, getting news,reporting sports scores and answering trivia questions."
1,"My child enjoys it all the time. Games, videos etc"
1,This is the perfect portable device. I believe it to be much better then IPad or in my opinion rivals it.
1,I got this as part of the Black Friday deals and my wife really loves it for reading books on. The battery lasts several days with moderate use.
1,I actually bought this for my friend that is going through chemotherapy and radiation. She loves it!
1,It works like expected. The photos are not as good as my cell phone but ok enough for the price
1,"Bought the Kindle for xmas gift,the young lady really loves it she reads books on it."
1,"I like than is compact I can carry on my purse, I don't need to worry for book mark and I can be reading 2 books a the same time,"
1,"Wonderful Product, do not need a computer any more. Great price too"
1,Bought for a Christmas gift and my nephews love it. I highly recommend
0,"So I've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so I got it and began the prime ""free trial "" I was shocked to wake up this morning to find out I had been charged $107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with Amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the Alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues I think the tablet is OK but no great but because of my recent experience I rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision"
1,Great price and product. i bought 2 for my nieces. This is very practical and does the same as the more expensive one's.
1,"I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:)"
1,My son love his kindle! Perfect size and good price
1,They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
1,This product does everything. An ipad does at a quarte of the price. Am very pleased. Highly recommend
0,If it understands your question it works quite well. I enjoy it for music and basic knowledge.
1,Great starter kit for a child. Highly recommended.
1,I love this tablet because I get it for a cheap price! Followed some tricks to download play store in the tablet. Works great!
1,I would recommend this product it's very helpful. I purchased the dot for my daughter. Alexa helps her with spelling words and more.
1,"I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."
1,I love how easy it is to use and the variety you get.
1,"The Kindle fire is a great little tablet. It works great for what we needed. We use it for reading, games and email. I recommend the Kindle Fire gets it done in style!"
1,"What a cool device to set timers, play music, read you the news, turn of/off lights and change your temperature all from saying the trigger word. Works great."
1,Arrived quickly and works perfectly. Very happy with my purchase.
1,Well priced. Easy to operate. Fast and efficient. Great product.
1,"Excellent Amazon product perfect for my 4 year old, I put it into kids mode and she loved it!"
1,My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours
1,"Video quality from the Amazon Fire TV box is amazing. I have many other streaming devices from Amazon Fire stick first gen and Nexus player, this device is head and shoulders above the rest. Highly recommended."
1,Never thought I would like it or use it but my family and I use it every day!
1,Person really likes the gift. Says it is ideal for his needs and then plus. Easy travel size as well.
1,Works really well only wish it had larger memory for streaming better on slower network
1,Debated whether to purchase this or not. Recently cut the cable cord. We also subscribed to sling tv and already was Netflix subscriber. Love this option. My favorite is the music stations. Most have lyrics to the songs I enjoy through amazons fire tv.
1,Awesome...........................................
1,The Fire is great for me. I do a lot of reading and now have WiFi abilities to get more books directly onto the system.
1,Makes me want to ditch cable since everyone has fought over the firestick.
1,The kindle is great for reading at night and is very comfortable.
1,"I love Echo. Love the Music, weather, news& workout"
1,Best e-reader for now ! eyes feel comfortable for reading !
1,"Great for puzzles and games, especially for the price"
1,I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
1,Well for a tablet of this price so compact and complete is not much to ask for than just your self to use it to the maximum capacity.I love this Kindell Best product ever.
1,Simple to use. Easy to sit up. And a lot of fun for entertaining guests and kids.
1,"I was not sure how much we would actually use the echo, but to my delight, we use it all the time. I love that it is so easy to use and I seem to find more and more that I use it for."
1,"It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more"
1,Font and lighting options enhance readability. Light weight and durable.
0,I have an IPad but thought I would buy this Black Friday to play around with and program to give to my Mother to enjoy.
0,Don't buy this if u don't read books also very rarely read the book
1,Got this for a Christmas present for her and she loves it. Helps that I am a prime member as well cuz she can download more movies and so on.
1,I had purchased a fire stick before I purchased the fire tv and it would freeze up and crash after long usage fire tv runs great.
1,I wasn't sure about buying this product. Until I saw all of the amazing things it could do. A family member showed me and I was amazed.
1,I wanted a tablet had no idea what one I wanted and the sales clerk said that he would buy this one if it was him making the purchase so I said OK bought it and was in and out of the store in 15 minutes! Great service and a great product!
1,"I use this all the time for playing games and reading books, it's great for surfing the web too."
1,Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money.
1,My 18 year old loves her kindle paper white! Very user friendly and easy to read!
1,love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table
1,It's a lot of fun to use with everyone in the family
1,I love my new Kindle. Previously had the Fire HDX 8.9 and upgraded to this one. I love love it and still discovering new things it can do. Very much recommend all purchase this
1,"Excellent sound and voice recognition, would recommend to friends."
1,Best investment I made. Will buy one for every tv in my house
1,The tablet was everything I was looking for for my little girl thank you so much for making such an amazing tablet
1,"I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet"
1,"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
1,The grandson loves this tablet to watch church....
1,A great ebook reader which is easy to read in sunlight and can be dimmed right down at night so it doesn't disturb my wife. Top menu can be a bit confusing but on the whole all user friendly.
1,"Easy to useIt was a Christmas gift and I had to buy one for myself too , after I realized I could do so much on those tablets. Can fit in my purse too!"
1,"This is great for the beginner, not a big investment."
1,My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more!
1,"My kids like it, and the application is amazing.I recommend it for all kids"
0,Do not pay attention to their ad. It says the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is. If they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about. Steer clear these guys are rip off artist.
1,I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
1,Many I do not know rather than features to search the web. Nice sound for a speaker
1,I bought the tablet for my children and they loved it.
0,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
1,"I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot."
1,"Alexa sits in my home office and plays music for me throughout the day. She is also quite helpful when my children ask me questions that I don't have time to look up for them. Fun product, easy information gathering."
0,"It was doing a great job charging my kindle, but now it takes almost all day to charge."
1,"works great, good for the price. I canceled my cable subscription completely"
0,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
1,"This is a great tablet for streaming Netflix, Hulu, and Sling TV. It doesnt do so well for exploring the internet as it seems to be slow to load compared to other tablets. The limited memory is more than sufficient to download several movies and shows for long car rides. The battery life is also impressive."
1,"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!"
1,"We bought the speaker to put in our kitchen and to link with our Smarthome items. The sound is good when listening to music, sometimes it has difficulty understanding your commands though"
1,Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
1,"havent been able to use to its full potential, but cant wait"
1,I purchased this for my 7yr old who loves reading but also loves the apps and games available. This has a fast load time and I recommend a SD card to go with it. We needed it after a few days of downloading books and apps.
1,Great service at store and product every much as advertised
1,Easy to use and put kpdi on it now I can watch movies whenever
1,luv this amazon fire. able to catch shows that I have missed. also able to watch full episodes of series
1,We had gotten some of the other Kindle fire tablets and they were all great to use. This one is no exception.
1,"Nice reader, good screen, easy to use, and the camera is a nice bonus."
1,We bought two of these Fire Tables online Black Friday. We loaded Google Play and then our Google accounts. I still can't believe they were only $35. One of the most exceptional buys for Christmas...or EVER. Very happy.
1,Can't live without it like having a genius friend around
1,I really enjoy my kindle. My only issue with it is that I can't get some of the apps I normally use however it does have most of them.
1,Could not be easier to set up and use. WiFi is flawless if ethernet is not available. Loaded with content.
1,"THIS TABLET SERVE THE PURPOSE ITS PURCHASE FOR, MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND HELPS HER GREATLY WITH HER PLAY TIME"
1,The guy at the store was really helpful. There was not a pink Fire Kids Edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. My four year old grand daughter loves it.
1,Works well with my amazon account. Its great to take along when awaiting for appointments.
1,What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.
1,I bought the Amazon Kindle so I could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. I usually read my ebooks on the Kindle app but I have gotten frustrated with my phone/tablet going into sleep mode. This Kindle is sufficient for my needs. I purchased a reading light for when I'm in low-light situations and it works very well. I am satisfied with my purchase.
1,A lot of tablet power and features for the price. Kids will thank you.
1,This Amazon Kindle is awesome! Has all it's features including a built-in camera!! Purchase this for my son for his 16th birthday! He absolutely loves it!
1,Great way to get books quickly 24/7 and easily. Battery life is good.
1,"I BOUGHT IT AND BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT,GREAT TO FIND STUFF AND SPECIALLY MUSIC, GREAT SOUND TOO,WOULD RECOMEND TO ANY ONE"
1,"Cut the cord! With this, able to stream using showtime anytime, HBO Go, amazon prime, netflix, and playstation vue. excellent interface. highly recommend!"
1,Must have if you like to read on a tablet. Easy on the eyes and battery last a long time!
1,I purchased this item solely for the purpose of listening to music / recreational games for my young child I love the fact that I found it in Orange! & overall it's a good tablet for minut activities.
1,In this day and age of everything online this is the one to have. It works so easily and smooth.
1,"Very well built, enjoy reading on it and streaming video"
1,"I bought this Echo because of the price ,its fun! i like the stereo component the most but I also play with Alexa often,,,,still learning how to submit the skills, most of which you need to interact with Alexa."
0,Not compatible with South African plug standards. Bought this unnecessarily.
1,"Bought it for my mom,it's going to be easy for her to use."
1,"The is a comfortable device. It's easy to hold even with a cover. No eye strain. The light doesn't disturb anyone else, but makes it possible to read in a dark space. The battery lasts a long time. I like this much better than my nook."
1,Works exactly as expected. I bought this in an effort to convert my old flatscreen with no smart capabilities into a smart tv. Definitely got the job done!
1,I bought this for my 5 year old son and he loves it!
1,Bought 3 of these for the family and it's been awesome.
1,"Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great."
1,Love this little tablet. Price makes it easy to love.
1,Really like this device helpful and fun. We like the accurate data and the fun skills. Can't wait to connect our lights
1,Great gift idea and easy to install and use - would highly recommend!
0,"Bought to replace our broken kindle reader. Good battery life and size, much heavier than our old paper white. Easy to organize and find your documents, and books with. Wireless works smooth so far."
1,This amazon fire tv was a great gift. many movies at your finger tips
1,"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
1,"Perfect for anything I need to do on a tablet. Watch movies, play a few games, surf the web. Works great and is much faster than my old samsung tablet."
1,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase."
1,"This tablet runs great and looks nice. Easy to use and get around in the menus , only problem I had was I couldn't get my pc to see the tablet to move my books to it."
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! It's so perfect for kids! Love that we can read books on them and I love the child lock lol! She loves the games too! Perfect for my girl!
1,Brought it for my niece for a Christmas and she loves it doesn't lag or anything it works just fine
1,Brought for my four year old he loves it has no problems using it at all
1,Not the first and not the last one I will buy.Love the app to run it on my phone too.
1,We love this. Play almost any song just by asking. Speaker is loud and clear. Connects to my Samsung tv Bluetooth. A+
1,I am very happy with fire tv. i was even happier went it went on sale a week after I bought it and best buy gave me the diference back.
1,"The Fire TV is great for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime streaming! Fast OS, great remote and has Alexa integration."
1,"I got one for my wife since several of our friends have one and they spoke highly of it. It's sometimes hit and miss with Alexa but overall, it's nice to have something that can set timers for the kids, play music, and as the software improves, I can see this being even better. The integration of the Skills and functionality could certainly improve but overall, it's one of those convenience things that you can live without it but it sure is nice. Since we have a bunch of kids, we have elected to turn off the online ordering just to be on the safe side."
1,It was everything I wanted and the salesman said it would be.
1,I didn't buy it for the tablet purpose I just bout for an eReader and it works fine
1,This Kindke is not only for reading books it acts as a great tablet with apps and can be used for dual purposes
1,"My son is crazy about it,nice size,good grafics,and Internet conection!"
1,Great for my needs that are beyond the tablet applications
1,The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
1,"My mom has enjoyed using this product, we are looking at purchasing prime, the nest and light bulbs so they can control it all from there."
1,"I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do  including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source."
1,Alexa is great! Some glitches with recognizing voice commands or questions but overall fun.
1,Love it. Love my new fire tablet. It is so convenient
1,"It's simple, if you want something with a larger screen to look at, but don't to buy an ipad, buy this."
1,"Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use."
1,Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
0,The family loves this because they can communicate to this device and ask it to play their favorite songs or questions or just about anything you can Google.. Even jokes!
1,"works great for asking questions that we used to google, the sound from speaker is good ask alexa to play music is a go to, You need to Purchase amazon prime to have access to music, but there is movie streaming also and free shipping make that a good value"
0,PPI too low for reading.. kinda regret getting it.. should've gotten a used ipad instead.
1,This is a great little tablet. The price is unbeatable. I have been using mine for about a month. Never a problem. Easy to download good graphics and always plenty of free downloads to entertain!
1,Purchased for one of my granddaughters and she loves it. The price was right and it works great.
1,Good Product a little hard to set up must be close to WiFi Alexa App is not user friendley
1,Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use
1,"We bought 2 of these for our kids. First, I couldn't believe the price; they were on sale for $35 but are normally still under $50. I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire. Also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things :)"
1,Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small
1,Love being able to walk in from work and ask Alexa to play whatever music I'm in the mood for. Get up in the morning and have the news read to me as I get ready for the day.
1,We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
1,What Can I Say 120 volts goes in one end and 5 volts comes out the other. WOW! High quality.
1,My 10yr old loves it . He stays on the pad for hours and never get bored ....
1,"I needed a tablet to replace one that daughter broke. So I looked around and came across the Kindle Fire. From the start, I wasn't disappointed. It's fast, very responsive and perfect for my needs. This will be my go-to tablet from now on."
1,For the fundamentals of tablet use this one works great!
0,I feel like it plays the same playlist every time.
1,This is a descent tablet for kids. Not all amazon apps are compatible with this is device which can get annoying. Storage is limited (8gb) so that too can get annoying. (Especially when 4gb is used before you ever get started.) Video quality is great but picture quality is lacking. Overall the tablet is easy to use and my children (8 & 12) enjoy using it. I gave it 4 stars because for the cost I think it is a pretty good tablet.
1,"Love this kindle!!! It is amazing for the price, well worth it!!!!!"
1,"Bought this for my Aunt and she loves it so much, she uses it everyday and says its very easy to use."
1,Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.
1,As everyone else has stated. Easy to read with outside. Great for under the umbrella on the beach also.
1,I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
1,"The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect."
1,"This is a great tablet for my 9yr old, and a great price to go with it."
1,The best streaming device of all the ones i have tried.
1,I love my new Fire. The only problem I have is putting it down when it's time to go to bed.
1,Alexa picks up my voice clearly. Great sound and very stylish for my living room.
1,"Got this for my mother in law and it's awesome. She loves facebook, browsing the wed. It's the perfect size for carrying around in your purse. Love it!"
1,Very easy to navigate and so many option it's unbelievable. This great gadget saving me alot of money canceled my cable subscription.
1,Great product! Needed something I could travel with.
1,I bought this for my eight year old child. I didn't want to spend a ton of money so for what I paid it was worth the money.
1,It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
1,I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!
1,"Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing."
1,Alexa is a great source of knowledge. Love her!!!!
1,Absolutely LOVE this Echo. You can ask it anything and it helps around the house.
1,"Love that I can read this at night, with the lights off, or have it tucked (snugly) in my jacket pocket on the go. Wonderful device with great battery life."
1,"First time tablets for the childeren. Great gift at a great price, the parents love them too. Basic tablet with many features that are very useful to the whole family. Not too sure about battery life just yet."
1,I purchased this tablet for my daughter and ordered a protective case for it. She really enjoys amazon free time and I really like the way amazon software works.
1,Great for reading books and the kids app is great. My 5 year old loves it
1,This tablet I can read all the letters and words on so it is pretty good. I hate the ads on the lock screen the goverment doesnt need to know when I READ MY DIGITAL BOOKS>
1,"Great tablet for the grandsons. They love it and it fits all their needs for Facebook, Email, and reading"
1,I love how portable this Kindle is. It fits right in my purse and makes it so I can read whenever and wherever I have free time.
1,"As a full time student, I wanted a budget tablet that would let me read pdf files, open class notes and powerpoint presentations. I got the fire 7 when it was on sale for 39.99. It does what I wanted and more. I use it for class and to kill time between classes with games, movies, and youtube. Battery will last two days of constant use, the size is perfect and fits my pant pocket (back). Overall great buy. Only downfall is the volume to my headphones, I found it to be quite low, but for the price, good enough."
0,first tBlet that i got was defective and returened and got anothers one because when i powered on screen was totally white
1,Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
1,Great product for my kids to read. Was an Xmas gift.
1,"Great for all kinds of things such asmaking a shopping list, setting a timer, reminder for whe the Game starts, etc."
0,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
1,"Easy to use. Comfortable to hold-lightweight and good size. The light adjustment is great. Easy to inadvertently turn the page-sometimes more than one-still trying to figure out how not to do that. Over all, though very happy with it"
1,"The price is right! Can't beat the price on this model for an introductory tablet or a tablet for a child. Wonderful that the tablet offers internet access for books, games, and movies. Good size for travelling and small hands."
1,Not much can be added to the already substantial positive reviews. I bought both the Fire TV and Fire Stick so I'll comment on that. The Fire TV is much quicker and love the ability to run Ethernet and USB right to the unit. The Fire stick is great for our bedroom but this Fire TV is best for main TV viewing.
1,Purchased the Alexa to act as a vocal head to my smart home setup. It does this very well. She will tell you the weather on command and plays music too. Can also act as a bluetooth speaker.
1,Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up
1,"If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!"
1,"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
1,"We love our Echo! Easy to use, helpful and doesn't I see up our data plan"
1,"I bought this for my boy, he is too happy to play games and no issues so far."
1,The Amazon Fire is a great way to watch movies tv shows and sports. I connect directly to my router in my opinion works a lot better than WI-Fi.
1,All the products I have bought from best buy are working so effectively. I will definitely recommend it to friends.
1,I bought this to replace a Kindle Fire for my mother. She is losing her short-term memory and kept getting lost on the Fire. This is much easier for her to use. I have owned one myself for several years and I love its ease of use and the self-lit screen. The Paperwhite is a well made device and I recommend it to everyone.
1,I've only been playing around with it for a few days but already love it. Very simple to use.
1,I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:)
1,"We hooked it up to a wemo switch so our 4 year old can turn on her light, we will sit around the table asking Alexa to play obscure songs, but the best is when we check the weather and our 4yo goes""hey that is what mine (dot) said down stairs"". We use it for a cooking timer and making shopping lists. It trully is As some! Yes it has glitches but this learning curve is actually fun."
1,This was a gift from me to myself. I am very pleased with this purchase.
0,"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this."
1,I love being able to access music and knowledge hands free.
1,I bought four of these for my kids and they love them
1,"This little set top box packs a big punch, it is an absolute must for any media center. The processor is very fast compared to its counter part the Fire TV stick, no buffering issues and an expandable memory slot. You can also use wireless keyboards and a mouse to alleviate those remote clicks when searching for something. The voice activated remote is a beauty just say anything you want to it and it will look it up for you within the Amazon apps. This is a great add on to any entertainment center setup."
0,This is good for beginners but not very good . Its wifi work terrible
1,Great tablet plan on purchasing another . Not slow happy with the speed
1,"Surprisingly better than previous versions of Kindle. Light, vivid, easy to use"
1,Perfect e reader for beginners. My daughter is 9 and loves it
1,"Although having an Amazon Prime membership adds to it's charm(Amazon Music), it's not a must have to enjoy all of Alexa's skills. Adults can enjoy music through Spotify and the daily briefings while the kids in particular enjoy her family friendly jokes. New skills are rolled out almost daily. I was glad that MS Outlook calendar is now an Alexa skill."
1,Good for the kids or the adult who just needs something for travel.
1,Great tablet for price. Upgraded my son to this after we ran out of space on the Kid Fire.
1,I bought the 2-pack so my significant other and I can play our personal music in different parts of the house.. it was easy to set up and Alexa answers most of my questions intelligently! I am very pleased with my purchase and I know there will be applications to add to the basic system...
1,I have received great feedback re: how easy to use - the size of it is perfect for kids. Easy to use.
1,Great tool for every day life and excellent sound.Highly recommended.
1,"I got this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present, and she hasn't been able to put it down."
1,"I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version"
1,"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
1,"I love my kindle.,for the price this thing is great and does what I need it to do"
1,Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....
1,This is a good product for a beginner who likes technology.
1,easy to use. looks good. The prize winner was very pleased.
1,"my daughter really loves her kindle fire,awesome choice"
1,"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into Settings in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.-------------------------I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echos hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo.Read more"
1,"I failed to ensure that this kindle had LTE, as well as wifi access before purchasing it. As it turns out, it has only wifi access making it difficult to download titles on vacation. It's still a great product, I just wish I would have gotten the LTE version."
1,I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money
1,Granddaughter loves it. It does fantastic for her.
1,It will take some time to get familiar with alexa's features. I'll get back with you later
1,the tablet a 7inch starter tablet is very durable excellent tablet for kidsvery tough good processing speed.
1,I bought this for my daughter after having previously used a kindle fire hd 7. This kindle was the perfect size for her and she cannot stop reading books off of it.
1,Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
1,Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it.
1,This was a gift for my wife. She uses it mostly as a Facebook portal and loves it.
1,"I got this as a second Kindle e-reader as well as an educational and leisure tablet. I also have a Kindle Keyboard; I thought that I wasn't going to enjoy reading on the Fire because of the back-light, but it is very adjustable and has a setting to turn the blue-light off for reading at night. I also wanted my kindergarten students to be able to use it educationally; it has a kid mode with great parental settings and an option to pay $2.99 a month for tons of awesome content!"
1,I would like to say that they are really tuff the hold up to my kids lol
1,Price was good. Great for reading. Needs more apps.
1,Bought this tablet as a birthday gift and the person loved it
0,I like your this tablet. It's easy to use and gud camera.
0,"I got the FireTV stick more than a year ago. It works fine although streaming video from my NAS sometimesnot very smooth. As I found the NBC Sports app allowed me to watch Olympics on the stick and this FireTV was on sale, I upgraded to this box. The result is a mix. It does stream video better than the stick but the same app did not work on the FireTV as with the stick It keeps giving the authorization error in playing some video clips. Withe same account, I can play the same video clips on FireTv stick or on Android boxes and tablets. I decided to keep it simply because of the great price I paid."
1,"Easy for reading, easy to hold - can send emails, takes pictures - must be connected to WIFI to get setup."
1,It offers many more options than I was looking for. It is easy to use
1,"The Echo is fun, useful and entertaining, I use it for making a grocery list, for a timer while cooking, etc, and I love it for listening to news on the radio and to my music on my play list."
1,Considering what you pay this is a great product. I didn't expect this to be as good as it is.
1,Replacement for earlier version of kindle fire. Extremely affordable.
1,Enjoy using but sometimes Alexa struggles with answering questions. Nice to have not a must have. Definitely room for improvement.
1,This is a great product to buy o be able too watch all kinds of shows An movies An more worth every penny
1,"I recommend to all, great speakers and easy to move about anywhere around the house. It keeps getting better each month. I bought one for my parents and they to are loving it to, so simple anyone can use it."
1,We bought 3 of these both our sons and our granddaughter LOVE then easy to operate so far no glitches sturdy and not so expensive I have to worry about the kids breaking them and not being able to replace
1,Great tab. Purchased as a give for a Christmas party.
1,Great tablet for my nephew he watches his videos on it all the time
1,"Bought this for one of my 4 young nephews; he loves it. Sharp graphics, great sound and vivid colors. We played some racing game he got me hooked to (downloaded it on my phone, now my wife/daughter tease me about it. The price was more than fair, and I like the craftsmanship (compared to the Sero 7 Pro I own), its light and ease to carry, and keeps youngins occupied for quite some time (added bonus)! Definitely worth the purchase."
1,Love it so much. So easy to use even for my little kids.
1,Neat new tech. Kids love it and we use it almost every day.
1,Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This was the best purchase .. I highly recommend it
1,Very awesome tablet for kids and great parental controls
1,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn."
1,The amazon fire '7 tablet was $33 on black Friday. How could I not buy a name brand tablet for that little
1,"The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable."
1,The PaperWhite was the perfect upgrade to my older Kindle that required a light in order to read in low light conditions.
1,"Bought as a gift. Wife loves it, enjoying and learning new features each day"
1,Text is very easy to read and downloading new books couldn't be easier. Definitely recommend this product!
0,"Disappointed with this tablet. Get one that uses Android system, not Amazon."
1,I bought this for my husband for Christmas so we haven't used it yet.
0,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.
0,restricts use of some web pages- including barnes and nobles where I have a library- useless to read the books in my Barnes library
0,I originally purchased the Google Home and it was very nice but speaker was not loud enough and it was ugly on my night stand. I swapped to the Echo and it is nice looking at the illumination when responding. The bad part of this device is you have to be very specific when making request and the echo can't hear you when the volume is over 5/10. If I had to redo it I would probably keep the Google home. It was more accurate even on my wake up alarm.
1,How can you complain about anything this food for this cheap?
1,Heard about this through a friend. Was not aware the product even existed. Has really enhanced our time watching TV.
1,Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
1,Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
1,"Great for a 2 yr old, and will use it till he's older"
0,"If I could give it a lower rating, I would.This is nothing more than a speaker, and a big one.It is NOT wireless so you cannot even take it outside w/o a power source. You cannot ask questions and have Alexa search answers. Very expensive. Would like to try google but since I cannot return this - I can't justify the price. Everyone said give it time to like Alexa. I gave it too much time and did not realize you had to return within a time frame (my bad)."
1,"I ordered this as I had already purchased one for myself and I found that my 4 year old son could use it quite easily and loved the games on it. I also has purchased the 2 year no questions asked insurance. I like that I can set time limits, when the device can wake and when it can sleep. How much time should be spent for educational work vs play or movies. I like the heft of it and not having to worry how much it costs in case either of my children decide to throw it across the room. I have a child with autism and learned the hard way that electronic devices can become air borne in a moments notice for no reason at all. So I am no longer willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet.Also, I had purchased a Galaxy Tab 4 and found that I couldn't use Amazon Apps on the secured profile side unless I installed the app on ""that"" side which would give my children access to purchasing apps. I was not going to do that which rendered any amazon apps useless on the Galaxy Tab 4. I also found that my older son wanted the Amazon apps from the Amazon underground store that my youngest son was playing. When I looked on Google Play for them, those same apps to put on the Tab 4 were $10 a piece!! Being they were Disney apps. Well, this tablet has virtually paid for itself in my opinion and now both my children are happy. I have insurance on both so I am not worried about them breaking them. I don't have to match $10 apps on another device. My children read books and watch movies, or play apps, so the internet isn't really a concern, as it is a little slow but not painful.Overall, I definitely would buy it again and I would recommend it. Very happy with my purchase as it suits my needs."
1,"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it."
1,We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it.
1,Easy and age appropriate. Can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun.
1,I cut the internet cord and I can't be happier!!! The Amazon Fire Tv offers so many apps and program options!! I wish I did this sooner.
1,i love my kindle. i use to have a nook but my kindle is so much nicer and easier to get b ooks.
1,This Samsung excedes our expectations. The picture is clear and colors vibrant! Love it!
1,i love the music offered through amazon . say the song and she plays it for you. say good morning and she gives you history of the day.
1,"Two improvements needed. Better browser, it is awkward to use to connect to library. Also want to see black background with white lettering for night reading"
1,I like the box sometimes it glitches out but it's really easy to troubleshoot.
1,"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
1,Currently this is the fifth version of the Kindle Fire that I purchased since they came out. Purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a SD card unlike the other ones I have. It seemed to not run as smooth as my Kindle Fire HDX once I started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since I use other tablets for that. This was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from Amazon Prime to watch offline.
1,We bought this tablet for our 6-year old. It has a lot of kid-friendly features and my daughter loves it.
1,Great product for the price. It performs perfect for everyday use. My son likes it for his educational purpose.
1,I am happy I decided to go with buying the Firebox I'd first decided to buy a fire stick until I had read more about Firebox and all the other operations it has functionality it has compared to the fire stick it was a no-brainer.
1,Bought this to stream movies. Plugs into to a electrical outlet and into your TV HDMI. Very easy.
1,"This thing has some issues with the screen lighting being different up top and down below, but overall, this thingredients is amazing. I read all the time on this and highly recommend it to anyone. I even bought one for my son."
1,Price is great and my 6 year old LOVES it. Overall perfect.
0,Was not a fan of this product Browsers are extremely slow
1,Kids love it can downloead lots of games great charge system
1,"Excellent. Nice solution to non smart device. If you use with a smart tv, the tv remote will also run Amazon TV. We use it with a projector and usb audio for the sound."
1,This reader is a gift to my daughter for Christmas. She said that it works great at the beach!
1,I got this to use DirectvNow and it works great.....
1,"Great personal assistant, calender works well , and you can message friends who have an Alexa. List for grocery store works well and sports updates are great"
1,"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
1,"Purchased for my grandson, he loves it. Purchased a blue cover for him"
1,The Echo is great! Excellent sound and Alexa is very responsive to voice commands. Amazon got this right. Makes Siri look ridiculous. Just starting to understand all of the uses but a great speaker/system
1,"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
1,"But you can't beat the price. Normally $50, these were on sale for $30 for Black Friday so I picked up 2 as gifts."
1,"Trying to read a book on my iPad is next to impossible. The Kindle Paperwhite is very easy to read outdoors, even in bright sunshine."
1,Its a great device. Sound is amazing throughout the house .
0,very good produ ct and service will defintely refer to a freind.
1,"Perfect tablet for the price. Does everything incredibly well, snappy performance! Thinking about getting a second one! Expandable memory is a massive plus."
1,I am in love with my Kindle. It has everything I was looking for and more. It is extremely easy to use and small enough to carry it with me in my bag.
1,"Love it. Was debating on getting it first, but have no regrets after using it."
1,Box works good with Kodi. Voice feature isn't as good as apple tv.
1,"Bought 3 for my young grandkids exceptional security for kids, great babysitter as well as educational tool"
1,It is not an iPad but for $40 it is a good tablet. Really good for reading.
1,"I LOVE HOW AMAZON HAS ""CHILD ONLY APPS"". SHE CON ONLY ACCESS AGE APPROPRIATE MATERIAL"
1,"Works as expected upon purchase., no issues easy setup."
1,The tablet is mainly used by my 9 year old daughter .... Easy to use!
1,This is our second Kindle.Highly recommend pairing with Amazon Prime. Getting the Kids unlimited package.
1,Amazon TV works great when paired with the Kodi app.
1,Excellent bargain and works for all purposes that a tablet is needed for.
1,"Was looking for a simple tablet to use during my commute. This fits the bill. App store is limited, but this is good for simple web surfing or watching videos. Lightweight too. Only thing I don't like are the ads on the unlock screen (but, this is minor considering the price)."
1,"Having owned numerous streaming devices - Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Fire TV stick and now Fire TV used on various TV sets in the house, I can say Fire TV is my favorite. The attractive interface and slick navigation, coupled with what I would consider excellent content, I truly enjoy my Fire TV the most. And future-proofed with 4K resolution just tops it off."
1,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
1,Alexa is a blast and a lot of fun. Voice recognition works well and the microphone picks up speech at quite a distance. I also purchased a dot. Boy have decent sound quality.
1,This is the best thing I ever bought. Very lightweight and user friendly. Fits easily in my purse.
1,The Echo is amazing. I am able to control the smart home devices from a number of different platforms. Also having the timer and alarms functions makes sure I am able to keep on schedule if needed.
1,Couldn't be happier for what Alexa offers. Good Product.
1,My kids love this tablet and I love the price so it's a win win situation
1,I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
1,"I purchased this table to use to check my email and get on Facebook, but I use it for so much more. It is a great tablet for a good price."
1,Super happy with my purchase. Neice snd nephew were fighting over it and they both chose it over their iPads!!! Who would have thought!!
1,"I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games."
1,"My wife asked me to get her an Echo for Mother's Day and man, am I proud I did. She loves it. She gets the weather report regularly and ask Alexa a lot of questions. Frequently I hear songs she asks Alexa to play. What a fantastic machine!"
1,"I love my Fire because it's so easy to buy\\review books, movies on plus shopping is a breeze, as well as downloading apps. I would'nt give mine up for the world."
1,We bought my brother-in-law the dot and decided on the full size for ourselves. It's been fun and stil haven't explored all the capabilities.
1,Bought this for my granddaughter so i could get mine back. She loves it as expected!
0,Had nothing but prblems wasnt satisfied at all and will never buy agian
1,This is my second kindle purchase. I absolutely love them. It's compact and easy to use.
1,Truly changed the way that we live in our home. Ease of turning off lights. Getting answers to questions when Mom is too busy and listening to our favorite tunes. Not to mention the calling feature where you can call to another alexa that is at a friends or family members home etc.
1,This is the best media box for Kodi on a budget. Works great and everything loads just fine
1,Excellent Customer Service.I encourage anyone to purchase this tablet it works well parent block is outstanding
1,Great tablet for the cost. I am going to buy more.
1,"I bought this game for my son, and he loves it..it is very entertaining."
1,Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive!
1,I use it to read books that i borrow from thr library. So far it is great.
1,"The Echo is an amazing piece of tech. It only rarely fails to understand what I'm asking it, and connects to virtually every smart piece of tech you own. Love it."
1,Great features. We use it in the spare room and sometimes move it to the livingroom . I love it
1,Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music.
1,Great tablet keeps my daughter busy and happy.she can do so much on it
1,"Purchased kindle paperwhite after my kindle touch of three years fell and broke. I love the light on the paperwhite and that I no longer need to use a separate book light. The light is adjustable, which I love because when I'm reading in the dark in bed, just a little light is needed. Great price and great product"
1,very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality
1,"Both the Nook and Kindle are. Easy on the eyes but the Kindle is able to get books from many sources"""
1,"Great way to enjoy reading wherever you are. The lighting feature is definitely worth it, as you can read it anywhere."
1,"Have bought these for myself, grandkids and daughter. Nice size to put in purse and easy to take with you in car. Lots of uses for this."
1,"We had been using the Nabi for our 3 year old, but after the reviews online about the dreamtab we decided on the amazon fire kids tablet. So far so good. Very easy for our son to navigate without worry about getting on unauthorized websites."

1,Got in a little trouble with the missus and picked this up as a smoothing over gift. she loves it
1,Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use.
1,"What can I say? It's Alexa. Not just a toy but a very useful tool. You'll find yourself using it much more than you think. Timer...check, To do list... check, Music... check. The list is seemingly endless so plug it in set it up (easy to do) and have some fun. Cheers."
1,Everything worked just fine with the product and we would buy again.
1,Love my new tablet its amazing recommended it for someone whos looking for a tablet for a cheap price
1,I bought this product to add to my TV in the family room. Great buy
1,"Kindle fire has nice video quality, easily connects to wifi. Now has the ability to use micro sd storage for photos or videos. Micro usb keyboards also work by simply plugging in."
1,"Great Tablet, good value for money. I got this as xmas gift for my famaily."
1,I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well
1,"I was originally just looking for a cheap but reliable tablet, on a post-birthday afternoon, when I learned Amazon was selling a low budget version of the current Kindle generation.While my opinion is slightly biased due to some personal modifications, I can say this is an excellent purchase if you're looking for a portable browser and book reader. A fairly decent and accurate battery. Sound is low in volume but reliable. Expandable memory works for applications, so dozens of apps can be added quickly. While I can personally say it's extremely durable compared to iOS devices. A small fall against smooth stone does not cost anything but extremely fine scratches only visible in sunlight.However, by default, you're extremely restricted by the Amazon marketplace, which is nowhere near as updated and expansive as Google play. If this could access both stores, I'd give it a 5 out of 5."
1,Bought this tablet for my daughter after having a Nabi in the past. I myself had one of the first generation Fire and loved it. In comparison to the Nabi this is a much better buy! Over all the price and App Store are so much better.
1,This is a great easy little computer to have if you just want something to access the internet that doesn't require a phone contract. We are using it to run training videos off our training website so we can do shoulder to shoulder training. Works out great for that.
1,I have been reading on a tablet with the Kindle app. Worked great and really got hooked on e readers. However living in Florida I could not read outside. Purchased the Kindle Paperwhite and problem solved. Really like my Kindle. Haven't used the tablet since the purchase.
1,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.
1,"I debated on getting Alexa for a while now and I'm actually sad that I did, this is a fun tool to have. I love being able to access Sirius XM on it in the mornings. It's easy to set-up and takes maybe 5 minutes. Must have if you are creating a smart house, which I am."
1,Excelent product it works perfectly with the others appliance in my home
1,Very easy to load up exodus and watch what every you wanna watch. With kodi. Never pay for cable againHave already recommended this to a few friends. They are all happy
0,I like what you get for the price. But it is a little tricky for my kids to figure out so I do have to help them a lot.
1,"Small enough to make it portable, a lot faster then the Stick."
1,Easiest money ever spent with instant gratification and still portable if necessary.
0,It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
1,Run nice and smooth in long run. Overall great buy.

1,Great overall with multipurpose functions and good sound reproduction
1,Love the fire box! Quick and easy to navigate. I watch all my faves in the apps and cut the chord with my cable company!
1,Amazon has produced a great line of eReaders that only improve more with each generation update and model. Cant go wrong with the Kindle Paperwhite. I've used the Kindle reader on other devices but it is made to be used best with the Kindle. Bought it at Best Buy as I couldnt wait to have it to start reading.
1,Very rugged design. My nieces absolutely love this.
1,This is a great little tablet for kids works fantastic
1,"Did not go shopping for this item specifically, but the salesperson saw us looking at it and gave us lots of information and we bought it. Pretty cool, we are still getting used to it and love being able to play music via voice commands."
1,"I Use this device to control lights, temperature in the living room and it works great ... Also a decent speaker on its own"
0,Built solidly. Very slow. I bought this for my kids but I cant download kids YouTube on it
1,This tablet is perfect for kids. It is inexpensive and durable.
1,"I love this tablet! I will buy a bigger one next,I'm tired of cumbersome laptops,and this goes Anywhere,use my phone as hot spot,I have windows phone,and my fire is android...too heck with the Galaxy phone,lol with a Galaxy,lol."
1,Great device to use Best Buy Bucks with. Glad they had it in stock.

1,Love it use it for watching tv and listening to music.
1,"I own the previous version, now, with this one, I 20 times happier! Everything works like a charm!.. I think I´ve never read so many book like now!"
1,"For a pre-teen, this is what exactly my niece needed. It replaced an old iPad for her. It does almost everything the iPad did. And the price was a lot better."
0,Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it
1,"This is what it has come to. You can now buy a quality tablet for $50. Amazing! Works well, just couple things. It uses amazon app store, not, Google play store. It runs an OS called Fire 5.0, which is based on android OS. So you may not find apps that are available the same as android. Of course, all of the big name apps are there. But if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hands for not a lot of money, this is a great choice. Amazon has a philosophy. They want to make money AFTER the sale. So that's why they get you in at a low price. Also, they have created a revenue stream by selling ads. When your screen times out, it will post a ""screen saver/wallpaper"" that is an advertisement. If you want, you can go to your amazon account, pay a one time $15 fee (per unit, not per account) to get rid of them,"
1,"Perfect if you're looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it's still awesome."
1,"Finnally decided to read book on eink instead of ipad and got this kindle.I just love it, it is amazing. The text is crispy just like real ink, and the backlight is helful in all lighting conditions. Kindle books are cheaper, so buying this reader actually saves you a lot of money."
1,"bought my 1st fire a couple of years ago, killed it, then saw the great sale price and had to get another"
1,Bought to replace broken Kindle screen. Cheaper to buy new then replace screen.
1,I Love my Alexa. You can ask almost anything. Great to hear music of all genre with. I will probably get an Alexa Dot for the den.
1,a very easy unit to use. Lots of entertainment options to watch.
1,I like it better than Apple TV. It's easy to use and get lot more apps
1,Very nice good product and the picture quality are very nice
1,MY KID LOVES IT. I LIKE IT BECAUSE I GET NOTIFIED OF EVERY SINGLE GAME HE IS PLAYING ONCE THE TABLET IS BEING REGISTER.
1,Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer
1,"Easy to program and works perfect. I loved it so much, I bought one for my daughter."
1,"This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them."
1,We enjoy looking at movies and other shows on our New toy.
1,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
0,Bought it for my mom so we can stay in touch and she could play crossword games or Bingo at her Nursing home. She needs alot of assistance
1,The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment
1,"Fantastic, better response then SIRIAmazon Prime account gives you complete control"
1,Easy to use and setup. This product does amazing things..
1,Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
1,"Needed to replace my original Kindle with a keyboard. Was leary about new model as very pleased with original. This is improvement as same size screen, but smaller in overall size and easier to scroll through pages."
1,"I have been a user of Roku and Apple TV before and I absolutely love the Fire TV. What prompted me to change from Roku was the availability of Playstation Vue. We are cord cutters and Vue is a better value than Sling TV.The Fire TV works well and has most all the channels we used on our old Roku. The only thing that doesn't work 100% is Vudu or other UltraViolet streaming services. The closest thing is Flixster, but some of the titles don't carry over right away. Most of the movies come through just fine, but the Flixster app on the Fire TV doesn't seem to bring over the TV shows I have purchased. Other than that, it works very well. Of course, if you watch a lot of Prime TV or use Amazon's Instant Video service you will really love the integration here."
1,Fire tv excellent for streaming tv channels. Cut the cord for cable.
1,Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use.
1,"This is a great little tablet! Me and my brother in law bought one originally for his dad because his laptop was getting a little old and the main thing he does on it is watch Youtube videos. It performs fine for what he does it for. It was such a steal my brother in law got one himself because he wanted to play games on it and again, works perfectly! Great buy for the price"
1,"Took a while to figure everything out but once connected it turned out to be pretty helpful with shopping lists, weather updates, traffic reports. Also used as a speaker, sound isn't as great as some the better ones out there but does the job"
1,Easy to use and download books. Great for beginners who never used digital book readers. I love it!
1,You can't beat the amazon fire tablet. especially for only $50!! I bought one of these for each of the kiddos and one for myself. With the amazon prime membership these tablets are on FIRE
1,The Echo was all as advertised - worked well right out of the box!
1,She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
1,This tablet is so awesome and my Niece's and Nephew love theirs
1,"Simple and intuitive. Plays Amazon content, Netflix, and I also run plex from it. Great easy to use product."
1,My kids love this tablet and its so inexpensive. I like that I can connect it to my Amazon account and see what they play.
1,Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
1,Bought this tablet foe my 8 years old son and he love it.
1,I now have voice controlled home using my echo and smart devices! Listening to any song I like in seconds using my Amazon Prime is probably the thing I love the best! We put it in our kitchen which is central to our living space and echo picks up all of our commands from any room downstairs!
1,Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates
1,"Good reader, nice small tablet, charging cord is to short."
1,I found the color my kid loved. Great kindle only costed $39.99. Fast and responsive. Crystal clear display
1,The Fire TV is by far the best streaming platform around. Amazon has done an outstanding job.
1,"Great tablet for the price. Pretty fast, touchscreen."
1,I like the sleek design. This is good enough for me. Works as designed to be.
1,I bought this because a couple of my friends have it. Mine is in the kitchen and I use it all the time. Love that I can ask Alexa to play a certain artist or genre. Super easy to set up and use!
1,A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
1,This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
1,a great price and lots of free games my grandson loves a wonderful pass time with all in one books and games and info
1,"I love this thing!!! You can do so many things with it. Make lists that add to my phone, set timers, play my music!!"
1,This was honestly one of the best products I have ever bought!
1,I love this kindle! My old one lasted about two years before it died so hopefully this one will hang in a little longer because I use it all the time.
1,"This is a very nice Tablet and for the Price I think is a great Price/performance ratio. Enjoying it very much so far. The only con so far is that does not come open to Access google play store, though there are some work arounds. Nice size and excelent resolution for ocasional streaming."
1,Rapid charge is always good!
1,"I own several Amazon Echoes. I use them primarily to listen to the vast Amazon Prime Music library, which gives you access to millions of songs for a reasonable annual fee. The sound quality of the Echo is excellent, though is lacking in deep bass extension. Overall I would recommend the Amazon Echo."
1,Bought it for my wife for her birthday. She used on a trip to Europe and loved it.
1,Got one for my nephew... very easy setup and has a ton of games to download!
1,Great product to enhance tvs that are quite as smart as we would like
1,had to return a digiland tablet that I got for my daughter for Christmas and best buy didn't have another digiland so they let me get the kindlefire instead of the digiland. My daughter likes it all except for the fact that she can't get the google play games that I have on my tablet.
1,I bought 2 for each of my children and they love it.
1,"Fast, reliable streaming. Haven't had any complaints"
0,"Didn't work well in 4K at all. After going in 4K mode and returning back to the menu screen, the Fire Tv would show a black screen and had to be unplugged to start back up. The menu screen isn't in 4K like it is in the Shield Tv which a better item by miles. 4K uses all of the resources of the Fire Tv and other apps have to be closed for it to play 4K videos or it runs into problems such as black screen."
1,I'm really impressed by the amount of expansion you can put in with a micro SD card for extra storage .
1,"I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!"
1,I bought my new Kindle Paperwhite because it has the lighted background. Works perfectly!
1,First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.
1,Great price! Kids love it. Lots of space for apps!
1,I like this tablet for kids because it's easy for them to use and also allows for parental controls to help keep them safe. Great value too.
1,The product works well. Great price for the capabilities it offers.
1,"I've had 4 kindles over the years and this is my favorite. So easy on my eyes and easy to read, even outdoors."
1,I Bought This For My Five Year Sister. It's Easy To Use & She Loves It. She Had A Nabi Before But The Charger Port Wasn't Suited For A Young Child It Was Easy To Break. This Tablet Is Ten Times Better All Around.
1,Bought this reader for a present for my mom. She loves it. Able to take her book with her in a smaller form loves how it looks like paper pages. Easy to order a new book.
1,i like this tablet its small fast & is just as good as any other tablet.
1,Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
0,For the price is good. But you have a lot of offers from Amazon on your main screen without even asking for it. Does not accept googlecast. The case for the tablet is too expensive. Well for basics it works fine
1,"This is a great gift idea for the person who is hard to buy for. Got it for my dad for his birthday and he really loves it. Overall it is a unique item that I would recommend for tech loving or even not tech loving people. It is user friend, just simply talk."
1,"Love the tablet not to small, lightweight, and is easy to use."
1,"I really love the back light on the paperwhite. I upgraded from an old kindle keyboard with a lighted case - and I love having the backlight built in. I considered the Voyage, to get the page press feature, but am very happy with the touch screen."
1,"Bought this for my son to encourage his reading ,and very pleased with this device. I have sideloaded the ability to rent library books and it works well. He can read easily without tiring his eyes or needing to go to library frequently. Since I have to drive him everywhere it helped both of us.  I wish there were more apps available and native library rental specifically."
1,Will be in the market to buy another one soon Great job Amazon
1,"This case is sturdy and will stand upright so that you can watch a video or read a book hands free. It fits easily in my purse, not bulky at all. The only bad thing is that the case only comes in a dark ugly color. ****** should offer at least one other color, preferably a light color."
1,I have had no problems with the amazon tv. It streams fast and has a clear signal. And has a clear picture.
1,"Most tablets i've tried really stink, but this one is ok. Wish it had google though."
1,"I know this is not iPad, or Samsung Tab. Nor I was expecting this tablet to get any close to any of them. But boy, for $34 this tablet rocks! I toss it in my car, gym bag and i am not afraid to toss it around. Great durability, great value for money!You cannot go wrong with this. Highly recommended"
1,Sound is better than I expected. Lots of fun.It is great for kids.
1,"I purchased this item for a very special women for Christmas, she is exceptionally happy. that is great for me"
1,I am really enjoying Alexa with my echo. I bought my mother in law one for christmas also and she loves it
1,"My child is having the time of their life, great for small hands."
1,I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift.
1,"Pretty cool little tablet, worked fast, had free games, lots of cool features, a camera, overall it was a pretty great tablet especially for how cheap it is."
1,"I purchased the Echo as a Deal of the Day for $130. At this price it is worth it. I have learned only simple things so far (Prime Music, weather, daily Jeopardy questions and getting it to tell jokes). But, I think it is well made and I'm sure I'll learn how to use it for more things."
1,The box is really good and it has everything to you need to watch when it comes to online watching
1,We have both apple and Amazon. The Amazon has many more features and apps than Apple.
1,Other digital devices are distracting. Kindle keeps you focused and gives a good feeling of reading.
1,"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
0,"The resolution on the games is not good. I didn't even try to watch Netflix because i knew it wouldn't show clearly. Also, it is slow using the internet. I assumed it would look and work like Android but i wrong. Everything is Amazon which i am unfamiliar with. Honestly, it is better for reading books. I returned for something more diverse and better."
1,"amazon won't let us download Plants vs Zombies.otherwise, it's terrific."
1,"I love my Alexa! Much simpler to set up than I expected, she was connected to my WiFi in under 3 minutes. She's yet failed to understand my request. Our next step is to get Ethernet-controlled outlets for lights, etc., so that Alexa can control those for us."
1,Easy set up. Easy to use and great assistance to have. It's like having the Internet as your own personal butler.
1,"I own all three of the latest Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV. Out of the three, as a pure streamer, I'd say Roku is probably my favorite followed by Apple TV and then Fire TV. However, as a multi-purpose device, the Fire TV wins hands down and it's not even close. The Fire TV allows you the most customization, freedom and versatility, such as the ability to side-load apps. Both Roku sand Apple TV are locked tight in that regard. Fire TV also features a more baked in Prime experience. The Fire TV can be a little slow sometimes and can freeze occasionally (more so depending on what you install), but overall, not a bad box for the price."
1,Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.
1,Very satisfied with the Kindle Paperwhite reader. The single issue I have is that I would like to have the capability to do reverse contrast. Not a deal breaker for me thought.
1,The tablet is durable and great for kids. The best part is the parental control.
1,It is a device that basically is easy to setup and the remote is great.
1,"I like it allot, but the memory size is somewhat limiting. I thought that I could save and run apps from the SD card, but it seems that most of the app still need to reside in the internal memory.Also beware that Android apps will not work on a Kindle. Kindle Fire apps need to be downloaded from Amazon."
1,My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!
1,Was using the Kindle app on my phone and running the battery down and dealing with glare. Paperwhite resolves both these issues. Not a real bookbetter.
1,"My grandson really enjoys the tablet it works well ,I love would definitely recommend it ."
0,Exactly what I expected!
1,My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
1,Super great deal! Can't get a tablet for this price anywhere! Kids love it!
1,"It's pretty good for the price! I bought mine for my kids to share and use.For this price, you may just want to buy one for each kid since mine tend to fight over it! The charging port on mine seems to not be working well (have to push it up to connect properly), but the kids tend to just rip the power cord out without any care. You may not have the same problem."
1,I uses these for Kodi and they never let me down. Hate seeing people pay more for items that don't need it. If you interested in difference between fire tv and fire stick the TV is boat loads faster than the stick. I started with 2 sticks and now have 2 TV's
0,Should come capable of doing more out of the box!!
1,"I thought this was a silly Christmas present at first, but now it is my most favorite Christmas present EVER!!! You can do so many things with it, it saves me tons of time, and they come up with new ""skills"" for it daily! I am giving each of my kids one, and my husband is so impressed with it that he is going to get a Dot to keep upstairs!!! I used to live my life with post-it notes, now I use Alexa instead!!!!"
1,What a fun piece of equipment. I constantly find things for her to tell me.
1,"This is an amazing ereader! The screen is crisp and clear. Super responsive to the touch. There are lots of fonts and sizes, so reading is a real pleasure, even when I'm tired. Very light and comfortable to hold. The light is perfect for reading at night without bothering your partner."
1,"I personally use this product to control home automation devices, a morning alarm, add things to my shopping list, a kitchen timer, and to listed to music and all of these tasks seem to work really well. Setup is super easy."
1,This tablet was amazing I love that I can add memory with a memory card.
1,Was looking for something that would work with most apps when cutting the cord and chose this. Works as stated and way faster than even the new smart TV's processors. All but got rid of the annoying buffering times.
0,"I was very interested in the Echo and respective echo dot based on potential functionality. While there are some good qualities, the overall voice automation and functionality haven't lived up to the hype yet. Pros: sound quality for music is fantastic, kids enjoy asking Alexa questions, overall family fun. Cons: even after a full month of learning my voice, Alexa continues to frequently answer ""I don't know what you are asking"", at random times, Alexa will start talking without any prompt, setting up additional controllable items and syncing are not as easy as Amazon would have you believe, and worst experience....every time an amazon echo commercial comes on tv to promote the product, my Alexa replies to the TV commercial as if it were me saying ""Alexa...."""
1,"I had to do OS upgrade immediately after purchase and the process is manual. Would have been better if the OS can upgrade itself similar to iOS or Android. OS thing aside, I love this device and its worth the money."
1,This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
1,Updated features are great and easy to use. Upgraded on the advice of Geek Squad when they came out to install a new TV. I highly recommend for those looking to cut the cord!
1,a friend recommended the amazon fire tablet to me. its easy to use and i am very happy i brought the fire tablet
1,The tablet and chrome cast is great for my child....
1,Happy with quality and resolution. Would recommend
1,"A nice size tablet for a technically challenged adult. Great for snapping pics, reading books and an occasional online search."
1,"I love the 2 cameras, and the video capabilities. I have set up the picture albums and can even share on Facebook and messenger. I like the side charger. Much better than front.I love the size too."
1,I had the small Echo Dot & this was an addition. The speaker is so much better then the Dot & I was able to connect them together so I can hear my music in both rooms. Love the Amazon Echo. Great purchase.
1,Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.
0,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.
0,"I purchased one as a Christmas gift. from Best Buy on line...it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks. I went to turn it on..did not get nothing .The lefthand bottom corner says ""FASTBOOTH mode"" It is locked on this and I get nothing else.Did not buy any product protection so I guess it is a complete loss."
1,"It is super lightweight and has an adjustable backlight for easy reading in dim to dark areas, and its not hard on eyes. I love that there is no glare, so reading outside is always on my to do list. It is not only good for reading but finding books as well with GoodReads. It has media connections like Facebook to find what people you know are reading. Downloading books is quick and easy, I just wish I would have spent the extra money on the convenience of free 3G. It also has child functions to make sure your child is reading daily and appropriate books available for them using FreeTime. They can even earn rewards for how much they read. Overall very recommended for anyone."
0,I had a chance to see the Google Home in action before I purchased this and now wished I had picked the Google Home. I have yet to have Echo answer a question for me without saying she cannot answer the question.
1,"Pros:-Fast-nice looking interface-good design-great voice search-good amount of most useful appsCons:-It can get tedious to scroll all the way to right to find the app you want.-They have many of the ""main"" apps but they're still missing quite a few apps that are available on other set-top boxes (Cinemax, Vudu, apps offering 4K content, etc.)-They don't have enough games considering they make the gaming aspect one of their main points of advertising.- Only 8GB of space and you can't use the MicroSD card as extended storage until they upgrade to Marshmallow.- Very Amazon-centricPlease be aware that you cannot play many of the games you can play on your Fire tablet or even your Android phone with Amazon appstore on the Fire TV."
1,"Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!"
1,It was a perfect gift to give To my Bro-in-law techie!
1,I am a previous kindle owner - my favorite feature of this kindle is the back light. I love to sit outside and read and this makes is possible without having to juggle a light
1,"Love my Echo, great sound and feels like I have my own personal assistant.."
1,"This Amazon fire tablet is a nice little tablet. Picture is sufficient for the price. Audio output is on back so if it's in a case, the sound is muted, but otherwise nice tablet for the price...."
1,Good device.. Easy to set up. You could stream anything u want basically
1,I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
1,Easy to use and install. Faster than running directly thru TV or DVD player.
0,"The music was good, however, Alexa's voice was inaudible most of the time. It couldn't meet our needs so we returned it."
1,This was a great purchase i do not regret buying it my son enjoys playing with it alot!
1,"Amazon Echo- Alexis-is the only woman who obeys me.Similar to most electronics, I only use about 15% of its power.I have over 6 sources for music, but this is my go to source."
1,Very affordable. Excellent tablet and comes in different colors
1,"It sounds great, works great and it's sleek. I recommend it."
1,I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift and she fell in love with it. She loves the feature to buy from Amazon without lifting a finger.
1,I bought this for my 12 year old son. He loves it and read much more now. Works as expected....Great!
1,After reviewing all of the brands out there. I decided on the fireTv box.
1,"I was especially glad it was so easy to get it connected and start using. Some of the limitations is how you ask Alexa a question, Sometimes you have to word the question different in order to get a useful response."
1,Worked great! Looks good. Feels good. Smells good.
1,If you love music or any kind of general information she can find it for you have it there and a quality of the sound is over what I expected
1,Got this for my son for road trips and it's been an absolute charm.
1,No longer have to carry a multitude of books when traveling. Makes travels do much easier
1,This is a good tablet! Kinda slow but what else do you expect from a cheap tablet? :)
1,I love the fact that this is so much faster than the Amazon stick. Wonderful product.
1,"Just love this streaming device. I have prime membership, tons of free stuff to watch. Very clear and sharp picture quality. Excellent for the price, lots of apps available. Get it, you'll love it."
1,"These are perfect for my grandchildren, ages 11 (boy), 8 (girl), 7 (autistic girl) and 3 (boy). They have everything they need to entertain themselves all in one place, especially with my Amazon Prime membership."
1,I have bought 3 of these units in the past 60 days and I find them wonderful entry level tablets for anyone looking too get the Best Buy for their money!
1,Can't beat the price on this tablet. Have to a student in college and they love it for taking notes and movies.
1,Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .
1,I bought it for my son-in-law. He loves it! He wanted it as another device instead of his iPhone. This way he won't be disturbed by emails when using it. It was a great price too!
1,"This tablet is so much easier to use than my 6"" fire. It is great for reading or eatching movies."
1,Great device for reading books. Screen is super sharp and the backlight is great in low light. Highly recommend!
1,"Love the sound. Plays my Pandora, Answers all my questions no matter how off the wall"
1,"Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference."
1,everything was as I expected.... and order it online and pick it up next day... easy to do...
1,"Received on time, and works great . I think this is a great product. And thanks for your customer service."
1,"Best purchase of 2017. If you don't own one of these devices, you need to!"
1,this speaker is amazing and alexa is a perfect friend
1,"alexa is awesome. So many things she can do. Set alarms, shopping lists, answer questions, change the temperature of my home! I can't wait to add light controls to the many things she can do. She is the first step to making my home a smart home!"
1,"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
1,This was a gift for my mother. She was very pleased with it & loves using it. It seems the right level for her.
1,good tablet for day to day use. Not for those who want HD everything but shows decent video in SD.
1,"Grandkids are doing great. Love this product, and thrilled with grandkids usage."
1,I bought this fire tablet for a friend who has been laid up and unable to walk since November. She loves it! It is very entertaining. She even watches movies on it! I am going to get one for myself!
1,"My dear wife is a voracious reader and Paperwhite by Kindle is her reader of choice. She absolutely loves everything about it.We also recently became Prime members, and she is hoping there will be some great books to read at no additional charge!"
1,"It is very fast and reliable, it is everything it says it is..."
1,My wife is a email and facebook user. Her laptop was always needing updating and was not the best thing for her. She does do some web surfing and it works for her.
1,"Purchased a new kindle because my original was very out of date. Has more memory, larger screen and does not freeze up. Love it."
1,"Grand kids can play games, read and talk to their friends with this tablet. Works great for us and it was priced right too."
1,"I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7."
1,Great tablet... Easy to operate and very durable..
1,This kindle reader is light weight and easy on eyes. Its a good reader but can be better if its UI is improved and made fast.The builtin lights are good and offer a nice option to read in dark. its fro some one totally in to books and wants to have those in handy.
1,"It takes time to set it up and learn what it can and can't do, it it's fun to use."
1,My kids really enjoy the alexa. I will buy more of these in the future
0,I have way more buffering with this device than I do with my Apple TV 4 gen. It works just not well. I have a glitch with this unit every time I use it. That indeed takes away from the user experience.
0,I guess it's ok...All the apps are in need of updating. Amazon won't or can't update them. There help center did nothing.
1,Gift for my wife. Great upgrade from the original kindle. The new features with built in lighting is great.
1,Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone.
1,I like my echo but it is taking time to get used to it and enable apps for what I want it to do. Its getting better but there is a learning curve
1,I bought this as a gift for a friend with a small child. The low cost of the tablet and general sturdiness of it made it ideal for her little one to play with and be entertained with the children's apps. Good tablet for day to day use.
1,I gave this as a gift to my sister and she loves it. The battery life is great. She recently took it to a trip to Canada from Texas and her battery lasted all trip!!!
1,I am extremely happy with my Kindle Fire. The price was fantastic. Functionality is great. I am very pleased with this tablet
1,Would recommend it to anyone! It is a great product!
1,"If you're getting this for a ""Value Tablet"" it is a great choice.Profile UI is lacking. My main reason for the tablet was to give my kids a tool to use ABC Mouse.They have to be logged into the parent account to even use it, so it defeats the purpose of having a kid profile."
1,"The first kindle I purchased only worked for a week. Thankfully, Best Buy did a full return. This one works like a charm! My kids love it!"
1,Purchased tablet for 4 year old twin grandchildren. Also purchased the protective cover. Absolutely love it.
1,I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
1,This is a Christmas present so it hasn't been used yet
1,"Because of the great reviews I have read on this product, I have purchased 2 for Christmas"
1,First had the fire stick and i heard the box was much faster. I bought it and as soon as i plugged in and got started i was able to see how fast and smooth it worked. Great product.
1,This is my third one I have in my house. We love the ease of use and compatibility with all our online services. Works great. Never had an issue with any of them.
1,I like it personally but still there are some improvement required
1,Got this for a family member who had on older Kindle that stopped working. They absolutely love it.
1,"The downside is everytime I open up the tablet, there is an advertisement. I would prefer not to see these. Font is changeable, brightness is adjustable."
1,I love my Amazon Echo!!! Great product and simple set up.
1,"I loved my book covers and the feeling of a book in my hands. But after reading countless reviews I gave in and bought a kindle. Now I can't imagine reading without it. After tons of booklights that died on me and heavy books that never fit in my bag. I can read anywhere, anytime, and in any lighting. I only wish the Kindle store was not so biased to kindle unlimited. It doesn't list the top books it lists people who pay the be on there. So you don't get genuine recommendations. Still, I will never read the same again. If you want to look up the mean of the word merely click it, if you want to make the font bigger you can do so, and if you want to see better raise the brightness. It's so much easier on the eyes than reading on my IPad."
1,This is just what I needed - great price - great tablet. I am a Math Teacher and I use this tablet in my classroom to award Class Dojo points and check on progress in Moby Max Math. This was perfect for me.
1,My little girl loves it and she can do so many things with it and the sound was a little to good because now I have to buy her some bluetooth headphones
1,Does everything its supposed to. My daughter loves it!
1,I love the Fire TV because I can stream all NFL games with the Kodi app and all of my Prime shows.
1,Alexa is great. Looking forward to getting a dot for other rooms and other devices for her. Still getting to know her but glad she is here.
1,Awesome for young and old can work anywhere hooks up everywhere and kid friendly
1,Alexa has mad our lives easier. It controls almost everything in our household.
1,"If, like I, you own an earlier generation Kindle that isn't a Paperwhite, this latest model is WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE."
1,does not understand me about half the time. would like to program it to fit my needs more. Great for timing eggs
1,very nice thanks best buy very fast and very good price
1,It would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices.
0,Look was good and very comfortable for reading. If allowed to install android store that would be really awesome.
1,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
1,Grand daughter is two years old and watches her older brother and sister use their iPads. So we got her the Amazon Fire Kids Addition and she loves it. She has a great time with learning numbers and the alphabet.
0,I connected my Fire HD and another tablet to this power fast adapter and got a low power connection message. I purchased 2 chargers and will be returning them. The fire tablet charging process took a very long time. I eventually unplugged it and connected to another charger.
1,Great tablet and great for the kids and simple to use and set up. I got 5 for my nephews and never had a problem with them.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my father to use to replace his now dated Sony e-reader, and he loves it. He loves the fact it has a back light and can be read in the dark, and even said he reads way faster on it than before. He no longer falls asleep while reading. As an added bonus he's able to check the ESPN app and more. What a great affordable buy!!!"
1,"I bought this primarily to play music and control remote outlets I have around the house. It works great for both things!Alexa, play my playlist. Alexa, turn the fishtank on.It's terrible at specific search type questions, but I don't use it for that."
1,"I was having some ""stutter"" issues streaming services through my Samsung Smart TV and thought I'd try an Apple TV or Amazon Fire as an alternative. Liked the Fire's ability to stream in hire definition (already have an Apple TV on another set) and lower price. I've been using it for months. Solved my ""stutter"" problem, works great, and talking to Alexa makes it easy to search and use. Just wish the Apple TV had an Amazon app and the Fire had an Apple app."
1,Love that my whole family can use this for anything from sling to Amazon prime to gaming
1,I used to have the first generation of Fire TV. Love it. This is the 2nd generation and 4 k ready. Even better
1,The Amazon Echo is a fantastic assistant and helps organize my busy day.
1,This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
0,"The Fire Tablet has an Android operating system but is not like using an Android phone. Amazon's software makes the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze. Also, you cannot download Apps from Google Play you have to get them from the Amazon App Store. There are several Apps from Amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them. Would not recommend without having Amazon Support."
1,you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search function.
1,"I bought twos when this tablet on sale, reinstalled the Android Open Source Project, and turned the tablet into a smooth-running, battery-efficient tablet without any bloatware. Very happy with the purchase."
1,I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.
1,Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
1,"The Fire tablet is a a great size and works well as an e-reader. There are also some nice apps available, but I was disappointed that although it is billed as an android tablet, I was unable to use some apps available from the Android store."
1,Great device for all your media needs. Plugs right in and ready to go and isn't hard to operate!
1,Super easy to use. Has Alexa for voice commands. We've purchased 2 additional boxes for our other tv's.
1,"This device is great for bringing in content to your tv. This device has a wired Ethernet port, USB and a micro SD card slot."
1,So easy to use and help with everyday things. The more you use it the more you can do with it.
1,I absolutely love my new Fire TV!! I am an Amazon Prime member and having the capability to whats all of my Amazon products and having the capability of using Netflix and other streaming apps at my fingertips is amazing!! Highly recommend this!!!
1,"Purchased two for my twin girls and they love. Simple, they can download apps and watch videos. Only thing the chargers are working not only after a week."
1,The fire tv has been a cool utility to add to the entertainment department in our household. Much more responsive than the stick... hardly any lag. Continuous updates from Amazon keeps the UI fresh & ever evolving content is a plus.
1,Got it for my 2 year old nephew. He is now completing puzzles and playing educational games on it!
1,I'm really happy with my Kindle Fire! It's easy to use and has so many featuresdon't know why I waited so long to get one :)
1,I love the echo as you can do many cool things with it.
0,You get what you pay for. It works but is very slow.
1,The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.
0,"I do find this better than the cheaper version I bought initially at Staples. It charges faster but not as fast as the Kindle charger that I had used for a couple years before it finally gave out. Also, it is not possible to charge and still use your Kindle, something I was able to do with the previous charger, a feature I really miss. Still, better than the alternative."
1,It's my second Kindle but it didn't come with any instructions so it's taking a little while to figure out. The back lighting is great.
1,"I love these tablets I have two, I would definitely recommend they are light weight and hold a battery for a long time, great for emails , surfing the web or just shopping im gonna buy another for sure you should by this product"
1,We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.
1,This is the 2nd one we have purchased for our kids. They love them.
1,I love my echo. Great speaker clear voice. Fast on answer questions.
1,The tablet offered my son hours and hours of continuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the batteries had to be recharged
1,Wish I could download Google Docs but otherwise very happy with my kindle fire.
1,"It has everything I need, and is a great product at a low price!"
1,I have enjoyed how easy this tablet is to use. My 3 year old can flip through it easily. It was the perfect choice.
1,I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
1,I love this. This is the best e-reader I have owned. Even thought it has ads it is not a big deal because that can easily be fixed to get rid of the ads on it.
1,"I bought a new 65"" Visio and it doesn't ha e the smart tv that is integrated. Now you have to use a tablet which would be ok but I have to sync all the time and it is annoying. Amazon fire tv is awesome, much faster than the integrated programs on the TVs. I love it, allowed me to cut the cable."
1,"So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone's battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :)"
1,"I have been enjoying my echo for about a month. I enjoy using it for Pandora, flash update, and general things like weather, and information through Wikipedia. There is room for improvement in services, but that is being addressed with new skills being added. Generally, I like it."
1,Great assistant for every day life. Has plenty of features for adults and kids alike.
1,I'm glad that I did purchase this Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - Black.It is really easy to use.
1,"I bought this as a replacement for an older model Kindle my father wore out. Unfortunately, he cannot remember the email and password for the older model, so I cannot transfer the thousands of books he has to the new Kindle. Always write down that important information somewhere, it will make life a lot easier!"
1,"Purchased Amazon Fire 7 from Best Buy because it was on sale and I had rewards points from a previous purchase. The Kindle works great, replace another one that would no longer hold a charge for any length of time."
1,I absolutely love this fire tv. I can't seem to put down the remote to stream different things.
1,Does a good job with what I do easy to add apps. It has decent performance
1,Part of gift
1,A great watch. I bought it for the heart rate feature and it is pretty accurate.
1,Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.
1,It took a bit for me to get used to the Kindle as I was used to reading the books on my phone with the Kindle app. I was a bit bummed with losing the color. I also dont like that it has no sound. Other than that it's a nice lightweight device with a good battery life. At first I thought it was defective because it froze up the first time I plugged in the usb. It actually stayed frozen for a couple days before it finally started working again.
1,Will update with feedback in due time. I carefully and purposefully chose this product for an avid reader.
1,This was a move up from the Paper White reader. I like the option of touch screen or using the pressure switches on on the side which you can adjust to your pressure that you prefer. Sharp fonts refresh is fast and clean.
1,Very good value for the money. Quad core processor allows for consistent streaming.
1,Works amazingly well. Allows me to stream so much more. Welcome to the next generation of movies.
1,I love the amazon echo! It has always worked flawlessly for us.
1,"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
1,Very pleased with the tablet. This is our fourth one we have owned.
1,"Streaming quality is great and nicely organizes media from Netflix, Hulu etc"
1,Excellent Quality and Size for my 5 yera old daughterWorks Great 100% Satisfied
1,I purchased this product a few months ago and have been very pleased. It is a very user friendly and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It has a great battery life as well.
1,Good tablet for the price. I would recommend this tablet
1,"When I bought the Echo back in 2014. My wife hated it and said she will never talk to inanimate objects. Fast forward 2017 and we use it to turn off lights, turn on the tv, set the thermostats, listen to music, and even as an intercom system. The echoes are the center of our home automation. The only negative I can see is that sometimes I do feel that it's always listening to every conversation but I guess there is a mute button for that."
1,We wanted an inexpensive tablet for our 8 year old and this one is perfect. He can use it to read books and play games and it was very affordable.
1,Better processor than the fire stick and has Ethernet port which is always good.
1,My daughter just loves her new Kindle. It's so easy for her to use and there's plenty of free apps for her to play with To stay out of brothers hair.
1,The easiest and lightest way to read a book any time and any place.
1,"Got this as a gift for my wife after she just about wore out her old Kindle. She only wants it to read so it didn't make sense to get the other versions. This one does exactly what she wants and she can use it to read anywhere, indoors or outside."
1,the reader is very compact so it can easliy fit into a bag or pocket. The auto light feature is also a plus.it takes a little bit to get adjusted to the side tabs and presume that future versions of this device will be improved upon.
1,Amazon Echo is great!! Easy to set up and use in your home.
1,Easy to use and very fast. Like the fact that you can expand the memory through a mini sd card.
0,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
1,"I'm an Apple fan boy. Between my wife, daughter and me, we Have two minis, 2 mackbook airs, a pro, 3 iPads, and two iPhones, and an Apple Watch. We also have 3 apple TVsI retired my living room Apple TV after finding out all the cool stuff you can do with the fire stick. This is a must for anyone with a prime account since Apple TV doesn't allow amazon yet (heard the app will be there soon). The best part is modding it with fire tv guru."
1,Inexpensive gift. Should have bought more to give away for Christmas
1,It was a Mother's Day gift my wife loved it she took it on vacation with her and could read it in the direct sunlight on the beach or by the pool
1,"I have the Amazon Tap (which I purchased at Best Buy about a month ago) and love it so much I bought one for my son and his family. They love it, too!"
1,This is my third one. They get better each time. I love reading out doors without the glare making it hard to see
1,It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.
1,One of the best purchases I could have made. I don't even have cable at home now because of this
1,I truly enjoyed it. I had it several months before buying an IPad.
1,I gave this Amazon fire stick as a Father's Day present. So i am not a personal user of the product but have heard it was nice.
1,works excellent in daylight either inside or outside and the backlight is great for nightime
1,"I bought this for my spouse, I already have one and know what to expect. Shop around for best price! Only black was available but at least it was in stock. Staff were helpful."
1,"I never owned Kindle before. I tried to just be content with a PW 2, but after close comparison in store, I sticked to the Voyage. Luckily, I haven't been disappointed so far."
1,"The Echo responds to ""Alexa"" and you can ask things like what's the weather tomorrow; scores of your favorite teams; play music from prime; set a timer to alert you; shop for Amazon items. Alexa is constantly learning what your preferences are the more you use it."
1,The fore lived up to its reviews. Great tablet for my elementary age grandchildren.
1,Great service I loved all of the items and were great gifts
1,"Easy to configure, works as expected, easy to download books"
1,"This is great for kids, it grows up with them, all the apps are good. My kid loves it"
1,"we love it, still wanting to find new tools to use with alexa, without making monthly payments to do so, it doesnt advertise all apps cost $$ we got iheart radio, on a fixed budget, this was a gift. if you could tell us more we can do, i would love to know! not tech savy at all, i know because we are told we are!! ha!!!"
1,This is a simple Ereader that looks great in any light. Highly recommended!
1,I have been enjoying my paperwhite. Like buying booKS and reading free books as an amazon prime membership benefit. I also bout a book that was in pdf format an I was able to read on paperwhite also
1,"I LOVE love love my echo! I have one in the kitchen and 1 in the bedroom. Love getting weather, plays my favorite music, controls my smart devices & tells the best jokes!"
1,I love the Echo...I have two of the regular echo's and two of the dots in my house...I love what they provide for our home.
1,Told myself I wouldn't buy another e-reader until it was water-proof. I got this for Christmas and have loved everyday since. It's lighter than carrying most books and it's non-glare and also back lit.
1,I have 2 iPad at home but I use Amazon Kindle fire for study. Very easy to use and light enough to hold in hand for long time.
1,I am so very happy with my new kindle paperwhite. It is everything I hoped for!
1,"Purchased two of these tablets for Christmas presents (10 yr old and 7 yr old children). Had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. Pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. No, they are not iPads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well."
1,I really enjoy Echo. We find we used it much more than expected. We are adding apps for fun and usefulness. Love the product!
1,Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
1,I bought this for my wife who just uses it for reading really. You can do other things like any other tablet. This is just really lite weight and easy to use. Plus its smaller than the ipads and other tablet that you'd have to carry around.
1,"I love my new kindle. My husband bought it for me to replace the first kindle that came out. This one is so light to hold. I use it for reading, surfing the web, and listening to music, I am sure it does more. I highly recommend this kindle."
1,Great voice recognition - super easy to set up - the closest you'll get to the computer on the Enterprise!
1,I absolutely love my kindle it is wonderful and I probably consider it my best friend!
1,This is a excellent item for kids. And better then spending 100+ for another tablet.
1,"The Amazon Echo is wonderful It has great tone. It can do so many things. It can be a timer, a sleep timer, play music, games, give information and is compatible with smart devices for the house such as lights etc. This is the third ""Echo"" product we have. We have 2 Echo Dots that we also like. I highly recommend this product and also for smaller spaces the Echo Dot."
1,"Look no Further, fast processor, great ram , expandable storage turn your tv into a smart tv"
1,I wanted a simple reader for east of transportability and use. Although I still occasionally use my tablet to read I wanted something more light weight. I haven't tested this in the sunlight but so far I love it's smaller size and simplicity.
1,Echo puck better deal when you add some cheap stereo speakers. Other than that they do the same thing. and the puck over a $100 cheaper.
1,This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
1,I am so happy with my new Kindle. The ability to use it in bed or lowlight is great without disturbing my wife. The download is fast and easy.
1,Alexa works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. My wife uses it for playing music through her iPhone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Alexa.
1,I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price
1,I never have any issues with this company or products!
1,I just wanted to be able to just read a book. Really very happy.
1,"Bought for my daughter , so far she is very pleased"
1,Pleased to learn that Echo has many features that I will use frequently. Very happy with my Echo and the excellence of the phone support I've gotten.
1,"Good tablet for the price, and excellent for kids."
1,this is just as good as a laptop of ipad why waste money on something expensive get this
1,"Excellent just 50$ , and has all the features and a vast collection of books"
1,"Bought this for my other tv which has an Amazon fire tv stick, world of difference as the fire tv is so much faster, buffering no problem"
1,"This is a great Kindle, super easy to set up and transfer info from old kindle"
1,A really good tablet. The kids love the apps that come with it.
1,ECHO (ALEXA) is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.Speak it in the AIR
1,Great for kids gotta love amazon they are the best!
1,Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use
1,My son loves this thing hasn't put it down yet keeps him entertained
1,"I bought this for my 87 year old nother who lives alone and I have to say it has far exceeded my wildest dreams. It is easy to learn, easy to train, and has a wealth of aps and tricks you can teach it. I feel like my mom is far safer now with this in the living room and the dot in the rear of the house. Better yet, it actually keeps track of what is asked so there is even a dianostic element to it that can aid in tracking decline in seniors."
1,I found the product could be of great value for the price. Black Friday deals rock
1,Very cool. Works great in our kitchen and response quickly to voice requests.
1,"Got this for my kids. Very affordable, good memory, well powered. 4 stars only because I did not realize the limitations of the Kindle restricted Android software."
1,Bought it for my nephew for Xmas we shall see how it holds up for him
1,Very easy to setup and use. Like the picture or screen. Bought 5 gave them as gifts. Everyone loved them.
0,"I enjoy the Alexa for music using Pandora. Unfortunately, I can not listen to music that is on my iPhone. I've done all the things that it told me to do to download music to the Alexa app but it still does not recognize the songs. Also, it seems that the Alexa only uses Bing for looking up information from the internet and not google. So, she's very limited in providing information when asked a question. Maybe, it's not that compatible with apple products and best used with families who have windows based products."
0,There are some privacy concerns as recently reported in the news and the device is limited without a paid subscription to Amazon Music.
1,Low cost alternative to Echo for additional rooms where do not need more expensive Echo with high end speaker.
0,This was bought for my daughter and it works great with her but I wouldn't recommend it for anything intense.
1,nice little tablet cant go wrong with the price can watch movies browse the net all kids of apps and can expand the memory
1,Great and easy setup. Easy to use for people that don't have much tech experience
1,Great product if you love to read!!! I use it all the time. Love that I can read in the dark with it.
1,This is the first electronic purchase in awhile that my wife loves too. Alexa is great. She does whatever you want. We love it for playing music. I love it for news and updates on various things such as stock market info and weather. Would recommend it for everyone that has Amazon prime.
0,"So I was already not too pleased with Amazon's choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd, and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of non-use to recharge. For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you. Amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories, this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty."
1,"I absolutely love this speaker. It is easy to use and the app is user friendly. I have used it at the beach, pool, lake, and park I will not travel without it."
0,Has good sound but when it comes to answering commands it seems to be a little on the ignorant side
1,"The Kindle Fire is great device for the whole family. My daughters and I use it to read on. You can change the size of the font, and the background color and brightness. In addition my son uses it for games and my husband to check sports scores via the Internet."
1,I bought them for my kids for Christmas. They LOVE them!
1,This product is very helpful in my day to day life as well as entertainment. I love playing a music on Amazon Echo when I am not in mood searching them in youtube.
1,Me and my husband love them ..we bought 2 for our kids and they love them so easy to use .... and the kids profile is great the tangerine is a great bright color too
1,My late stepmother had a Kindle Fire that she used to read her electronic novels and my wife loved how much easier they were to read than on the iPads. Lots of great reviews of the Kindle Paperwhite so this will be a great Christmas gift this year!
1,good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
1,"My husband and I live in the Dominican Rebublic as missionaries teaching the deaf about the Bible and our God. On Mondays we take the day off and head to the beach to chill and read a book. Our various tablets (iPhones, iPads, Samsung Galaxy, and Nooks we use for teaching the deaf) just didn't cut it in the bright sunshine to relax reading a novel. So while visiting the states we invested in our down time and purchased kindle paperwhites for each other. It is a basic tablet. We didn't want it to do ""everything"". That's what our other tablets can do. We wanted them to be able to get back to our love of reading for pleasure. The paperwhites are right on target for reading on the beach."
1,Nice lightweight reader. Very thin and so easy to use and navigate! Love it
1,Best starter device in place of an iPad or computer.
1,It does what it was advertised to do...... not the easiest item to use.... other than that it works great.
1,"I use my Amazon Echo everyday, and I am loving it !"
0,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
1,"Ebooks, audible and email, what else do you need? Great tablet!"
1,Great Value for the Price.Came to store to find a holiday gift and the fire was a great pick!
1,"Great size, clarity and many many apps, games and books to keep the kids busy on those long car rides!"
1,Works very well. Gave 2 for gifts. Would recommend buying this.
1,Echo is a fun and useful product. Still learning all it can be used for.
1,"Alexa features work great. Sound is very good for a small, portable speaker. The whole family enjoys interacting with Alexa. Mostly used for playing music. Wireless was easy to connect. Recommended."
1,I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
1,The back light is better for your eyes then reading on a tablet or phone and is similar to reading a paperback book but you can read in the dark without needing a book light
1,Bought it for my son as a replacement for his damaged tablet. What a great deal this is. I reccomend it fully.
1,This is my first e reader and I am enjoying it and its great battery life.
1,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
1,He loves it and can watch anything he wants on his own tv
1,"Can't recommend the Fire TV enough. This is the best media player on the market, and we've compared it to Roku and Chromecast. We use it more than our Smart TV's apps. Also works pretty well with Playstation Vue if you're using it for TV."
1,"I have two, one for each TV in the house. I don't even use my Apple TV anymore since I can also play HBO go and Nefflix on Amazon TV and there are several Amazon only shows (sort of like having another Netflix account)"
1,"Used to replace my wife's kindle classic that she loved to read books with.Had several Android tablets she tried to use, but they were too slow or responded incorrectly. This one is fast, responds properly and has far more capability than she is using. Only disadvantage compared to the classic is battery life, but it is certainly good enough."
1,This is cool. Helps me keep up with to do list and quick answers.
1,This product was easy to install. It allows me to view things on my television I previously could not. Now I have a smart tv plus it gives me access toMany other websites and viewing options.

1,"I am enjoying this refrigerator, so far we have no problems with it."

1,My family and business love this device. It's easy for the kids to use. Instantly provides music for our work day.
0,Tablet is ok I just prefere Android products. I dont Like the fire just being tied to Amazon accounts and loaded with all their exclusive content. But its a cheap quality tablet
1,"I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
1,Having been anticipating this purchase for a while my research was obsessive and not in the slightest bit was my expectations not met. It's been a extension that permits info more rapidly than before with not the need for a screen to see it. Still not lose to explored its limits that expand quicker than I could map figuratively. Love my Alexa!!
1,"I have used both paperwhite and voyage, and voyage has improved its support on the files, allowing you to customize the format especially when you are reading in a foreign language."
1,This. Is a great charger. I like it better than the square ones.
1,"I love Alexa. She has made my home smarter. I am able to use her skills to control my tv, thermostat and sprinkler system."

1,Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
1,"Very happy with my purchase, totally recommend this product."
1,Bought it for my mom and she loves it. Easy to use.
1,"I was worried about what I'd be compromising with a 49 dollar tablet, but this kindle is extraordinary for the specs. Yes it has a mono speaker and it's not HD but it's a fast performing tablet and you can't really tell. I don't regret this purchase at all!"
1,WE NEVER PUT THEM DOWN...HAVE LOTS OF GREAT GAMES TO PLAY
1,"i picked this up for my LED tv that came out a few years ago. this is great because i can use the apps like wwe network, HBO go etc. i got it on sale for 70 bucks deal of the day. well worth it."
1,I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
1,Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said!
1,This is my third Kindle Fire. It works beautifully. The only problem I have is little details that are different from previous model. (I'm getting used to it!) As I go I'm learning.....
1,"Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good!"
1,"I purchased this, so I could reduce my cable bill and I have to say, that I'm completely satisfied with Fire TV and the service I received from Best Buy, thank you!"
1,This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.
1,New OS 5 performs better than expected. No hanging screens and increased caching enables better video streaming. I purchased this as a replacement for an older model that my son broke - would definitely buy again.
1,I love it my amazon fire tablet . It is great for kids to
1,I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.
1,"I use it everyday. Battery is great and the screen is marvelous. It even has the Web browser, :), and I have used it even though it lags. I will recommend this to family and friends."
1,Nice tab and worth for its money..got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend...
1,She works great. We have enjoyed trying different questions.
1,The kids program option are great. Don't like that I have to register tablet in order to buy anything though.
1,"Bought this for reading on the Beach, works great. Plenty of books to choose from."
1,Very compact and easy to use. I Just wish it had Google play store but amazon is still great.
1,Bought for my dad as his father's day gift....he love it
1,I'm learning how to use it as I am new to using a tablet..So far I'm able to do what I want to do on it. I know there is more to learn.
0,"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them."
1,Good kindle not much different from the other ones. Worked exactly how I expected it to.
1,"this amazone fire tv is so awesome, you can download the apps called UVERSE yes if your cable is UVERSE u can play it with this app you can bring it to your neigbor or somewhere else.."
0,"Looking for a streaming media box? This is a fine android based one..it has an Ethernet port, streams, does 1080p, Amazon, and if you have all android stuff it's fine..I really don't like that it doesn't have a volume control..the only difference between this and the fire stick (for me) is the internal storage capacity, and the Ethernet port..so but two fire sticks instead of one box, unless you want to play the apps"
1,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two."
1,It's a great product for my son and I love bestbuy
1,"This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent!"
1,This is the greatest present I ever bought myself and worth every penny! She can bring a party to life or be your buddy and play games with you if your alone! Love Alexa!!!!!
1,I've had other e-readers before and like this one the best because how easy it is to operate.
1,I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.
1,Great purchase my grandson Alek loves his tablet we took it on vacation kept him quiet on the plane great gift for little ones Best Buy I made in awhile & the price was great
1,Got for my wife for Christmas. She loves it! Would recommend to others wanting the experience in a smaller device.
1,I love the Amazon fire TVEasy to set up and easy to use
1,I bought this to replace an old model Kindle. The only reason was so that I could have a good reading light for bedtime reading. This Kindle accomplishes that very well.
1,"My son is fascinated with this tablet, and iam too."
1,We bought the Echo after visiting relatives that had one. Had so much fun we just had to have one too!!
1,"Lightweight, small size that travels easily. Great for reading. Email capable but rather clumsy. I bought because of the long battery life and not to drain phone & iPad as I travel. Great for this purpose!"
1,"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight and easy on the eyes. It's the first device to allow me to read with as much comfort as an actual book.
1,Small but meaningful software improvements and a screen as good as the Voyager make this hands down the best value in the Kindle line.
1,Bought 2 for birthday presents for boys. They were on sale and a great buy. Going to be used to read on and game playing. Work well. Just wish screens were bigger.
1,I have apple tv and this thing is way better. I do have prime.
1,This is a great product. I already had wifi thermostats so when I bought my echo is connected very easily. Setup for the echo was quick and easy and I now have light bulbs I can control with it also. It's a great and fun product.
1,Got this for my living room for my kids to interact with. They love asking Alexa questions and the price was great for what it does. Also have a few Dots and hoping to be able to join all speakers as one in the future
1,I'm quite the gadget geek and this feeds that addiction! Have it controlling a bunch of lights and my TV. Next is a thermostat!
1,This is the best Fire they have come out with so far.
1,Awesome product and top notch hardware inside the box and remote.
1,"Bought this tablet a month or so ago and waited to see see how I'd like it. My husband has owned a Zoom and I've owned 2-8 inch Samsungs...this by far is my favorite. (we bought one for him the same time and he loves his too). I use it for email, games, social media, internet and some accounting. I love it. It's fast, reliable, easy to use, easy to see. It seems durable but for extra protection, I bought a shock case with a flip stand on the back so it can be protected and more versatile. My only wish would be that its battery lasted longer for my constant use...but I suppose everyone needs a break every few (2-4) hours. It does charge back up pretty fast.I think its a great tablet!"
1,Love the great deal on this tablet. Black friday deal
1,"Great product works really well for the money, !!!"
1,This is my first Kindle and I LOVE It! I considered buying a cheap used one but I'm so glad I went with the Paperwhite! I read in the dark way more than I thought I did. Battery life is amazing!
1,"We use our echo in the kitchen it's great for multiple timers while coking, music, news flashes."
1,Amazon fire tv has everything you will ever need in terms of streaming. I only carry local cable channels since purchasing this box
1,"I've owned several of the Amazon devices (box and sticks), and love the new 4K box!"
1,We are glad we bought this great for movies and everyday games
1,"I bought this tablet for my husband to download books, play games, and surf the Internet. I wasn't sure he would like a tablet and this was a good, inexpensive trial tablet. He really enjoys it."
1,"After reading many reviews on the other competitor products and even purchased another one that was much more expensive and complicated to install and operate, we decided on this one and could not be happier. Easy to install, operate, and has many features that we use daily. A big plus if you are an Amazon Prime member. Although the family uses this mostly for tv and movies, I use it mostly for listening to music. It is fast and we now have the unit on two tv's. We also gave one for Xmas."
1,I've had the first gen firestick for a while and this is a definite upgrade. Smooth user interface and lightning fast response time. Tons of apps to choose from as well
1,The cloud based service makes sure that it keeps updating the new softwares and services without manual intervention.
1,Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
1,My boss recommended getting a fire because she had one and so I got one too and i love that i can read my books from my kindle app on a bigger screen than my phone.
1,"Kindle is perfect for reading, this white version is really attractive to me"
1,Easy set-up. Fun for the kids. Alexa can even help with homework.
1,"My 7 year old loves his new kindle. As soon as he opened it and we got it updated he was off and running with it. He played on it all day, until he had to put it on the charger."
1,The best gift I could have ever given to my girlfriend! She loves it and I can play video games!
1,"Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend"
0,Don't have much storage...ok for kids. Purchase tablet as a gift but didn't last long
1,Got this tab for my 3 year old daughter. Shes always on my phone or tablet so got her her very own. It has all the functions and apps she likes and uses not to hard to use and gets the job done for the right price. She is 3 so she will drop and be rough with the tablet seems sturdy enough and not expensive that it's going to break the bank if she damages it
1,Love that I could get it in a color! And it's just the right size for little hands.
1,This is a really good device for those who want a cheep tablet
1,I first thought I would never need something like this but ever day I used it more and more.
1,It's great the size is perfect to fit into almost any small purse And weight nothing
1,I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.
1,This is a great tablet for kids. Not expensive and does all that is needed on a high level. The only draw back is the Amazon App store.
1,"This is the fourth one of these that I have purchased. My grand children love them. Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at."
1,"My children requesting iPad mini's for Xmas ,and not ready to make an large expense at young ages of 9. The fire has been a great product and my children are happy and so is mom and dad."
1,Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
1,"I bought this tablet for my grandson and he loves it. Plenty of memory, good enough sized screen for him to read and play games on. Compact enough to be easy to carry around."
1,"Weight is perfect.Size is right. It fits anywhereView is sharp, day or night"
1,"She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her ""bargain"" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it."
1,I already own a firestick. I decided to buy this one for my 4k tv due to it supporting 4k. I moved my firestick to the bedroom tv. Great product!
1,Still learning how to use it. Pretty user friendly.
1,I used a lot in my house for games and music and controlling household electronics
1,"I had trouble linking to my Joule Cooking App, finally got on the third day. I Love it now, still is learning Voice Recognition though"
1,Love the idea. but needs more resources for information. A lot of info that's out there that could be accessed
0,Didn't realize until after we bought it that there was no google play.
1,Got this as a christmas present for a 5 year old. The tablet has an excellent kids mode that he can navigate easily to play games or watch videos.
1,Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.
1,Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.
1,bought for my 4 year old daughter. plenty of apps and battery life is solid.
1,I have not used it much. I need to buy a wi-fi smart hub to make it work with my thermostat and other stuff.
1,"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
1,"I picked up a regular kindle touch a few months ago thinking I'd be fine with it. Lately my schedule is only allowing me to read in the evenings when its already darker out, and I don't like having to keep all the lights on to read. Decided to pull the trigger on one of these Paperwhites, and yep, wish I'd gone this route to begin with. The increased pixel count plus the built in light makes this thing a joy over the regular Kindle. Makes it a lot easier on my eyes and for that alone I recommend it!"
1,"Bought this as a gift--recipient was happy to receive it. After browsing prices online, I chose to purchase with Best Buy instead of Amazon because it was a better deal. The free two-day shipping was a nice bonus as well. A good experience all around; would definitely recommend."
1,"Easy to use, pages load fast, I use it for e-books."
1,I'm So Happy I Bought This. It Goes Everywhere With Me. Best Thing I Have Purchased In A Long Time.
1,"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
1,good product for the price very good if your an amazon prime memberkodi works somewhat ok with it
1,My 3 yr old niece loves her kindle. I couldn't imagine going on a road trip without it.
1,"Its pretty cool. A lot of teaching it things, but once you get it down easy from there. I am able to control the TV, hue lights and listen to music from any Bluetooth device connected."
1,It's okay so far.
1,Bought this for my 3 yr old grandson...very kid friendly & he loves it
1,I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.
1,Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!
1,Bought this for my grandson to watch movies on the plane. Easy to use battery holds up well.
1,I am happy with my item.i enjoy my product. I always shop best buy
1,"Great tablet, amazing price got it as a gift and they loved it,"
1,I got it earlier than scheduled. Very happy with the purchase.
1,With 5 kindles currently in the home this was a nice edition for my mother for reading her books. I compared this directly next to the basic kindle and the clarity of the font made it well worth the price difference.
0,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that'
1,"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
1,Works well and I would highly recommend this product.
1,Getting used to it. Sometimes she doesn't respond.
1,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
1,"Cant beat the price on these tablets. I take it into the sauna with me so I can surf online and send emails while in there. It holds up well in hot conditions. Cant say the same for my cell phone, and I wouldn't dare try doing it with my laptops."
1,"While there is absolutely nothing wrong with this item, the kids get more fun from it than I do. It is extremely impressive with its prompt responses and info."
1,"Very good product, just needs power on volume !!!!"
1,"First I wasn't sure to buy a Roku 3 or the Amazon Fire TV. But I am glad, I bought the Amazon fire. It works perfect and with Alexa, she makes my life easier."
1,Tablet is great for our 8 year old grandchildren to use.
1,Purchased this table for my five year old daughter and she loves it. Placed parental controls on the tablet so she can't make purchases or search the web. Very easy to use and has great apps. May get one myself!
1,My kids love this tablet! Good for those long road trips.
1,I use this mostly as an e-reader but it is also great for web browsing and e-mail. I didn' t expect such good performance for the price but I have no complaints.
1,"Amazon echo is simply an amazing product. I was able to set it up in minutes. In addition to all of the normal stuff you see on TV commercials it also integrates well with with all of my existing gadgets (Nest thermostats, Rachio sprinklers, Fitbit, Security system, Harmony remote hub, etc through IFTTT. My wife loves watering her flowers outside just by asking Alexa. The only thing I am really mad about is that it's now $20 than I bought it from Best Buy 4 days ago."
1,I can't live without the kindle paper white. It changed my reading habit. And the kindle getting better and better. Highly recommended.
1,With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
1,"Works fast, no lagging. Clear picture, much better then the fire stick"
1,The Amazon fire 8 is by far one of the easiest tablets to navigate through all the Apps and with PRIME membership it's truly a very easy and good sturdy design.
1,Plan to use the KIndle Paperwhite on a cruise so very important that we could use it in the sun.
1,"I have a lot of fun talking to Alexa. I've ordered a few things from Amazon thru Alexa which can be hard for her to understand what your ordering but, she's still learning."
1,Purchased as gifts for kids and they really enjoy them.
1,"(vs. Kindle Fire HD v.8.5) For the price, pretty darn cool. Lot faster than my old Fire HD. Don't like the display screen - to much app clutter. WiFi not the best for speed connection (tested over 4 connections). All-In-All . . for reading, kids, an easy device, and fast . . Yea, it is Good buy. Just don't expect miracle speed, a lot of bells-and-whistles, or anything fancy. I like it. IMHO."
1,Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
1,"I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs."
1,If you want a low budget tablet. This is the one. Don't be scared.
1,I bought this tablet for my son after the digiland tablet I bought him broke the same exact day. We've had this tablet for almost a year and it's still going strong. I just changed the case and screen protector. Still works perfectly for belonging to an 8 year old boy.
1,Was looking for a gift for someone who has everything. This fit the bill. It's fun as well as useful. My husband mostly uses it for news and weather updates and I use it for playing music and keeping up with my shopping and to-do lists but it can do much more.
1,"SuperA+, smart always ready to answer any question"
1,Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.
1,Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody
1,Works great as a movie player. All I use it for is watching movies on an airplane or at sea.
1,Great value for a tablet. I bought 2 for the kids.
1,"We were tired of paying almost $200/month for cable when noone was home all day. With Amazon Fire stick, we get to watch what WE want whenever WE want."
1,Works great for streaming apps. Much better than a chromecast.
1,"In bundle, happy!"
1,I love this tablet! Very easy to use and navigate.
1,I got it when my computer broke. Will get a laptop later.
1,"Working great and I love it...it's has a great quality ,good graphic and easy to use.."
1,Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal.
0,"My kids use it for playing games only. Memory is too limited. If you want to expand memory you have to buy special memory card from Amazon. Regular cards won't work. I'll like the app free time to help protect the kids from what they watch and play but it is difficult and time consuming to get updates for the games they play. Amazon does not have the best user friendly software for their tablets. They do what we get it for, entertain the kids for awhile."
1,If you want a cheap nice tablet get this one! It does everything
1,"This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus."
1,I have one Alexa to my daughter and one to my son. Both of their families love it. It's like having an auditory Google always at your fingertips. It connects to their Fitbit and my Amazon Fire. It makes us now want to turn our house into a Smart Home so we can get it to turn off and on lights and do all of the other fun things it can do. And it tells knock-knock jokes that have my kids howling with laughter.
1,Great for web browsing..shopping online..reading books and magazines or watching movies and you can't beat the price!!
1,I love this tablet. It does everything you want it to. And for a great price!
1,"Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it"
1,"Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase."
1,This is a great little system for listening to music and simple commands
0,"Pros:InexpensiveExpandable storageGood for Amazon Prime members and Amazon shoppersCons:Slow/sluggish performanceLack of apps (no YouTube, Instagram etc)Some available apps crash or can not be installedTouch screen freezesScreen resolution is not sharp or bright, greenish hueToo many links/ads to buy thingsSound quality is not goodWiFi onlyConclusion:For the price the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet is good for those who want an eReader that can also access email, Facebook and Amazon Prime but the lack of apps, cheap construction and buggy performance keep it from being a good, full-featured tablet."
1,"Perfect for a little book reader, movie viewer, or small game player. Can't beat it for the price."
1,"Great for the kids, made for a great Christmas present."
1,This baby breaks the ice and sets the mood for a date when you eventually bring her to your place. They can't get enough of Alexa. The music you can get her to play makes your company feel relaxed. Alexa is 10 thumbs up with me.
1,We just LoVe this product!! I have to buy a couple Echo Dots nest. It works and that's all you need. I add new skills from the Alexa app and they work good and will buy some Wemo outlets and Hues to add controls for my lighting in the house. It can only get better as new Gens of this product come out.
1,"The echo is a great and works well with other web based programs such as nest, and with the Phillips lighting systems. Plus it's fun to play games on!"
1,Bought as gift and great tablet for price! Awesome
1,Great buy. Cheaper than paying for overpriced cable
1,I love the Echo! Great sound quality. So easy to use. Just amazing technology!
1,This was perfect for my 5 year old u can set it to their profile so they can't buy anything or access the app you don't want them too. Best buy for kids who want a tablet!
1,Works just as it says. The echo is a lot of fun to have in your home.
1,the sound is excellent and it was easy to set up. have use it to control light outlets and play music.
1,great value for the pricing...black friday special
1,I haven't encountered any issues with it so far. I really like the screen mirroring capability because it lets me project my miracast-enabled Windows 10 laptop and my Galaxy S5 to the big screen. It really can turn any TV into a Smart TV.
1,Great product and fun to use. We find new ways to use our Echo everyday.
0,Hate Amazon! The app store doesn't have cool apps!
1,"I love my Amazon Tap. I was in the market for a portable speaker and I saw these one on sale so I decided to pick it up. I only wanted it for a Bluetooth speaker, but Alexa is amazing I use it everyday. Alexa was a huge plus."
1,So far so good seem like a good tablet for general stuff
1,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap
1,"I saw the reviews and was impressed so I purchased 3 Kindle Fire tablets for my grandsons who are 9 years old. Needless to say, they were thrilled with them!"
1,This tablet has been just what we were looking for to introduce our children to tablets. The price is excellent!
1,My elderly mother really enjoys this tablet. Easy to use and lightweight.
1,The Kindle Fire's are a great product to own. We own 2 and our whole family enjoys them. Easy to use.
1,I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price
1,just what I ordered - works as expectd
1,The paper white screen is so easy to read in dark and light conditions. I read in bed before going to sleep and the screen brightness is low enough that it doesn't affect your melatonin production so it won't interfere with your sleep cycles. I used to use a tablet but it was too bright and bulky.
1,This thing is great. I discover a new feature almost every day. I don't know how I lived without it.
1,Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it's so much faster!
1,Great product. Love using it for reading and search.
1,This little gadget gives me the same performance as the more expensive model I previously used! Hope it lasts as long as my other one. Is thinner and lighter!
1,I like this item it suits my needs.
1,"I was a little skeptical about reading books on this device, thinking it wouldn't feel like reading on paper. I was wrong. Very realistic."
1,The only thing I don't like is I can put my books in order
1,I bought this as a gift for my wife along with an Echo DOT. She loves it. Easy to setup and use.
1,Everyone needs one of these. Easy to use and fun to have
0,Tablet was working perfectly. Now the charging port isn't working. Can't charge the tablet. Will be sending back.
1,"I guess I thought you could ask it anything kinda like Google. You have to program everything it does,pretty limited right now. But still pretty cool"
1,"Lots of Fun!! Great for getting fast facts, playing a song, or adding items to a shopping list that's on the app on your phone. Great gift idea!!"
1,"Good product for beginners, has basic features necessary"
1,Very nice improvements from earlier models. Resolutions better and greatly reduced sun glare. Certainly worth the investment.
1,Great for playing games good size screen and fast love it
1,"I got this for my nephew,. It great durability since ithas survived this long."
1,I purchased this as a drawing for my business. Everyone was very excited about the prize.
1,Replaces the original with no problems whatsoever.
1,Really enjoyed purchasing thus product for little ones
1,"The Amazon Echo is very helpful and just plain FUN. I use it primarily for * Weather, * music on pandora, * ask simple questions. There is SO much more you can do with this...but I have only scratched the surface. It was very easy to install/connect to my home wi-fi - no issues here. The music audio quality is fine for a small device. It ""hears"" me very well - even from the other room. I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to answer more difficult/different questions using its internet search."
1,"I already had the Kindle Fire 7"", and this KF8 not only has a bigger picture screen but is faster."
1,"Pretty good tablet for the cost, I would highly recommend!"
1,The Amazon Fire Stick is an amazing device that makes it easy to watch movies and navigate through apps - I love the fact that I don't even have to use my smart TV apps because the fire stick has it all. I would definitely recommend.
1,I AM ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THE VOICE COMMAND AND NEW APPS FOR THE ALEXA CONTROL. IT HAS SHOWN MAX ENJOYMENT WITH QUALITY OF SOUNDS AND EASE OF USE.
1,I had the original Kindle. It lasted a long time. Juts got this paperwhite kindle. It's really 100% better. Strongly recommend it.
1,"Perfect for my home and all other connected products.Lots of integration.Bought this after returning GoogleHome, and am very happy with it."
1,This is a great reader for the constant traveler like my self
1,This is a great addition to all smart home devices.
1,Good for the kids and it works for playing games and reading. Exactly what I needed it for. Very happy.
1,We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
0,"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
1,This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.
0,Works and recognized a lot of commands but doesn't work when the music is high.
0,The Version with the light is the way to go. A case is a must the screen can easily be scratched. over works as intended
1,"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix."
1,Tablet runs well and the form factor is decent for such a cheap tablet.
1,Works for what hubby wanted it for. Will recommend.
1,This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix.
1,It very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or
1,Love the idea of it. Not as easy to put the DVD movies on it .
1,Awesome for cutting the cable. Get access to movies and tv shows
1,It is like having a stereo with every song. We have just started to use this incredible device
1,I own a Kindle HD and completely love it! But when trying to read in areas with a lot of light I kept getting a glare. With the paperwhite I have no more glare. Awesome!
1,"I bought the fire because I had heard it was a good tablet. So when I bought it, I was wondering if it lived up to the hype. It does. Its fast and easy to use. I put Netflix on it and watch series I missed. Only downside is that I had to register for a trial of prime."
1,I went to buy the fire stick at Best buy as it was recommened to me and was out of stock due to a recient add and the popularity of the product. I Read some reviews and decided to buy the fire tv great product easy to set up and use alexia is nice and has more storage space.i would recommend this product.
1,I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.
1,I love my Firestick! I dropped my cable a year ago and dont miss it at all!
1,"bought this for my step daughter, she loved it, goes everywhere with it."
1,Bought for reading while traveling. The battery last a long time.
1,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!"
1,I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.
1,Fire Tv works fine but the Remote leaves connection sometimes
1,Great device. Easy to use and great in sunlight. Easy to add to library.
1,"Bought this for Christmas for our 9 year old son, to take to school and out to restaurants. It was his favorite Christmas present. 6 times cheaper than an I-Pad mini, but he loves it as much as his full size I-Pad, but this is much more portable and smaller."
1,Overall a great device that has an amazing sound quality.
1,My son really enjoys his tablet especially the books and videos
1,I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn't downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them.
1,I didn't review prior to purchase because I already have one
1,Gave this as a gift and they have thanked me numerous times for it! I've had one for many years and it's still working with no problems!
1,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Got it for $33..couldn't beat the price. We found this was a greal alternative to pricier tablets and clunkier items such as laptops and Chromebooks, when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing. Display is great, Definitely recommend"
1,Looks like a real book! It's amazing! It doesn't last weeks like it says maybe a little over a week but I don't mind charging my electronics. It's really nice especially if you have kindle unlimited! I would recommend for people who like to read on the go!
1,It was really easy to setup for my kids and is a great size for them
1,"Great starter tablet, affordable price.i bought 12 units. Great Christmas present to my nephews and nieces."
1,Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
1,"I use my kindle fire for various uses, easy to use, you can read, play games, and go on the Internet with wireless access. If I can do it, anyone can so not techy!!"
1,I love it and it is very easy to use I take it every where I go
1,"If you want fast menus and stable streaming, avoid the WIFI only firestick, and get this FireTV. If you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you, do the work of running an ethernet cable. This box with ethernet is head and shoulders better than a Firestick. Firestick streams well most of the time, but sometimes it struggles and you get errors with either DirecTV Now or PS Vue...forcing a device restart...very frustrating. This box plugged in with an ethernet cable streams perfectly on the same network with the same content 99.9% of the time. I eliminated conflicting frequencies, used 5 Ghz frequencies, have a great router, fast internet, I tried everything. The cure was this device hooked up by ethernet cable. The fact that you can put KODI on this box opens the whole world of movies up to you. You can also load Android apps from your phone to the device with Apps2Fire...I put Blue Iris on my FireTV. If have two of these in my home now, one in the Master Bedroom, and one on my 4K TV. There isn't a ton of 4k content yet, but you can go to Youtube and see some amazing video in 4k there. When I buy a new home at the end of the year I plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television. I cut the cable company off 1 1/2 years ago and have never missed them. Other than internet, I pay $30 a month for PS Vue, and along with KODI I have everything I could possibly want and more. Goodbye Cable TV."
1,"Bought this for my friend, he likes it so muchEasy to set up a good good quality speaker"
1,Great expirience reading from a deviceGood for your eyes
0,"Tried IP controlling with a Control4 system, response was slow with button presses. Video quality seems better on Appletv"
1,Player has plenty of features and the picture quality is excellent.Would have been 5 star except the remote control is on the cheap side.
1,I love Alexa. She is great for information and music. It also keeps the kids occupied.
1,i love amazon fire tv is the best streaming in the world really recommend
1,"This is a Christmas gift, but the reviews I have read on it are excellent."
1,"Only gave 4 stars because although some things I like better then previous, less expensive Kindle, the previous Kindle had many features that I liked that I can not find on this one."
1,"My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price."
1,Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
1,"Excelent for reading, and for the kids. Own two of these, and they both work perfectly."
1,Bought this tablet for my 5 year old. She really enjoys it and has ease with working it. The only complaint I have is the charger insert has worn a bit over time.
1,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.
1,I needed something to travel with. The amazon prime was perfect. I can look at movies and get online and it was cheap and small to carry.
1,"Lightweight, perfect size. Love the built in light."
1,It is a great product! Strongly recommend a must have!
1,"This tablet was a gift to my nine year old and he loves it nice resolution fast, and slim. Cant beat it for the price."
1,Purchased for the grandkids to use while they are visiting. They never seem to get bored.Tip. Make sure you have it password protected or you may find a rapid run up in charges!
1,This tablet has everything you need to get you by. The quality is great and for the prize I can't complain.
1,"We are really happy we purchased our ""Echo"", we really enjoy simply asking Alexa questions, and the music selection is great. We simply say Alexa, play a Dean Martin song, and here it comes, if it is something we really like we simply say Alexa, a little louder. It is a lot of fun with a small investment, and Best Buy is the place to purchase."
1,I like the product. It's for my son so it should be fun
1,I love the Fire TV it's so awesome has so many things on it
1,great Kindle. Very easy to use and download books and read
0,I don't have wi fi. so I can't use the device. I'm returning it. I wanted something that my father could use as an e reader. I thought I would be able to download books via my computer using the usb cable. You can't do this unless you are registered. You cannot register unless you have wi fi. Amazon needs to fix this. This is a major flaw.
1,"Dear readers, if you have a 4K tv and want to purchase a device that can provide prodigious streaming entertainment quality then purchase this device now!!! It also has double the cpu speed (quad-cord) and GPU performance than the cheaper Amazon Fire Tv Stick model. However, if you don't have a 4K tv, then I advise you do not get this device, because you won't be getting your whole money's worth."
1,"To be clear, this is not a tablet. It's a reader... Just a reader. But it's a great reader. Very tactile."
1,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.
1,Great quality and cheap price I like this product and very friendly service
1,Great purchase would recommend to a friend easy to use
1,Bought this for my Mom who is legally blind and she loves it!
1,"The Echo is amazing in how seemlessly fits into any household, doing those little things that you wondered how you went without before purchasing. Everything from easy list making to playing songs for the dog when not at home."
1,Good value has all functions needed and good screen size
1,"This is actually really cool - great for parties... Surprisingly, Amazon was out of stock, but Best Buy came through!"
0,"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
1,Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
1,This item is great and fun to play with. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. Will probably purchase one for myself. I think it's nice to tell it to cut off the lights and turn down the music your playing without having to get up and cutit off. I love it when my son yells from his room and Ithe an hear him and does what it is told.
0,A waste of money. You don't need this. Just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month.
1,Simple to use. Backlighting a true necessity for me. Third Kindle purchased.
1,"A great price for new technology. I would definitely recommend this product for any family out there. This product is up with all current events, which keeps me informed of what's going on every day."
1,Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
1,I bought this for my dad. works great for a novice that just needs basics
1,"I got this for my wife since she broke her old one. She only uses it for reading and playing games but she seems happy with it. I've used it a couple of times, considering its price, I would say it's a pretty good tablet."
1,I bought this tablet for my grandson for Christmas and he is loving it
1,"I bought this for my wife and I to listen to music. With out Amazon Rime account, we are able to listen to most of the songs we request. The skills Alexa can do are also fun for our kids like 20 questions, odd facts, magic 8 ball, and kid jokes. My kids do ask Alexa a lot of general questions which she is not able answer as it does not have a robust search engine behind it like Google. However, since I bought it for music more than searching the Web for answers (as I do have a computer and phone do that) I am happy with it. If you want to use it as a search engine more than for music and the other skills Alexa can do I'd probably go with the other one."
1,Works great. Easy to use and small enough for travel. The only complaint is my first one would not charge after 2 yrs of use.
1,"If you are an Amazon Prime member it's Great. Order through Alexa, ask her questions and shopping lists are awesome."
1,I like Alexa but I wish it had driving directions.
1,Amazon Fire Tv was quick and easy to set up. After signing in with my prime account my son was able to watch a bunch of shows and movies!
1,The backlight helps for reading in the dark and in the sun. Easy to use and great battery life
1,Got this for my son. Love it! I get email notifications for every download so it's super easy to make sure he doesn't downloads ad anything inappropriate. Great little tablet
1,Excellent e-reader and great deal. Cover is perfect.
1,my son enjoy it so much. he is so happy with that tablet
1,It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station
1,I bought this for my niece and she loves it. She can read all the books she wants and it is a perfect size.
1,The amount of features on this tablet for the price makes it an easy pick for young readers.
1,Of course some of the shows don't come in the greatest sometimes but love this product and the best is I am saving money from not bothering with the cable companies and having a huge bill or the next month wondering why the cable bill went up in price.
1,"This is a great value tablet, great screen great apps. Highly recommend for media/games. I'll probably buy another"
1,This is the best tablet to get for the amount of money you will spend. It has everything you need. Maybe not the best camera but I phone for that.
1,"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with."
1,"I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
1,"I love this device. I have an Amazon prime membership, Netflix and SlingTV and this allows me to utilize all three easily."
1,I recently bought this as a blind buy for a christmas gift for a family member and they really enjoyed it. Also a great price.
1,"i bought these for my little girls, i think they don't need anymore, i bought extra sd card and they are so happy"
1,Alexa makes everything easy! This was the best purchase ever!
1,This is a great gift for kids! Gave this to a family member and it was a huge hit. Cool new tech toy and educational at the same time.
1,All my friends had the Amazon Fire Stick but I was not sold on streaming video since am a crazed videophile. When I read about the FireTV I decided I was ready to try it out. I must say that I've become a huge fan of YouTube and the video quality of some content in 4k is amazing. This is a good upgrade over the FireStick.
1,Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise.
1,Awesome product it is better than the stick highly recommended
1,I find this tablet very easy to use and easy to read at night
1,"the screen flush with the sides is great. The glass feeling is really nice. I don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. They are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. But, the price is painful. It is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect."
1,I have watched about 15 to 20 movies and haven't experience any buffering or freeze
1,This is an amazing device! I would recommend this to ANY reader.
1,"this should have been with the reader ,"
0,"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage. The OS is not well-optimized.I'm not confident that Amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon, so I'll likely return this while I still can."
0,"I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one."
1,Use it often for alarm and music .Would recommend for everyone
1,"I bought this primarily for reading at night without a nightlight as to not disturb my wife. It has been perfect for that and normal reading conditions. I was nervous to move away from actual books, but it has not been as bad as I initially thought."
1,I got tired of high cable bills and joined the cord cutting stampede. This works great and I save $100 a month. I also got a deal for half off the antenna for local channels when I bought it. Can't go wrong.
1,I got this tablet for my nice i really like it but i really dislike the fact that you have to be sing in into store in order to use apps
1,The Tablet works great for the price it cannot be beat. For those concerned about the limiting of apps to Amazon Marketplace there is a downloadable hack that will install Google Apps. Just look it up on Youtube and you are all set.
1,The best tablet for the money. I use it all the time.
1,The fire is a very inexpensive tool and toy for those of us just startuing to explore the world of diwloading.
1,"Easy, intuitive set up. Excited to see new updates."
1,"We have two firesticks but, now they will be replaced with the fire tv box."
1,"Got this as a gift to replace our under the counter radio. It is great that it will play radio stations or go commercial free with either our Amazon account or Pandora. Alexa will answer all kinds of questions, Like what is the weather she tells me the current weather. She will do jokes she does conversions for cooking. I am now looking to add the DOT to other rooms of the home for added convenience. We will not be getting rid of it any time soon!!!"
1,I got this device to start my home automation system. Alexa plays my favorite iHeart station at the touch of the app on my phone. She also turns on and off four light bulbs at my command. I ask her the day's weather forecast for my city. She also keeps my weekly grocery list and it goes right to the phone app. I hope to add other jobs for in the future. I went with these device because she has more experience than the Google device.
1,"Very Good product. it works very well, have no troubles with it at all."
1,I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
1,"I had an older kindle, and some of the features were easier to understand. But I do like that I can keep track of the book pages, if I choose to use that feature in the paperwhite edition."
1,I can't put this Kindle down! It's amazing to have this thing on me at all times. Best purchase of the year
1,Received as a Christmas gift. Took a little time getting used to page refresh - just wasn't used to the delay. I love how light-weighted it is. Fits nicely in my handbag when I travel. The battery life is great too. I only charge it a few times a month.
1,"A must have, echo knows all ur answers , just ask and it answers , it does so much more then I can figure out ! Happy that I got it on sale !"
1,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
1,"We purchased 3 tablets before settling with this one. The parental controls are great, easy enough for my 4 year old to play on. Just bought another one for my 7 year old."
1,Great picture. Easy to navigate and control. Loaded with entertainment
0,I'm returning it because a new version is coming i
1,"Guys this is Suuuuuper Fast! Forget the fire stick, UPGRADE YOURSELF. You are going to fall in love with it."
0,I am looking forward to getting to know this product better. it is not as plug and play as I thought
1,Excellent product. Easy to use. Mostly used for reading and utilizing aps
1,Want a port for addition memory this model had it!
1,This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
1,I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!!
1,Great speaker but may cost me a fortune to link to the rest of my house.
1,It is so much easier to hold a Kindle than a heavy book and I love it. I also like that it is lighted.
1,Nice product and excellent quality very convenient
1,"Kodi fans get the TV! Even if you have the stick, upgrade. You'll be happy you did. Very cool item!!!!"
1,Tab is good and fit for my req and battery life is also gpod
1,I love this and it's great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it
1,"I just use this to watch Hulu and AmazonPrime videos, and HBO. The one complaint I have is that there's no HDMI output, so when I travel, I can't hook it up to the hotel tv to watch."
1,I love the light built into this Kindle. I have had the basic Kindle for years but it's difficult to read in a room that is not well lit. Love the new and improved Kindle!
1,"I absolutely love this. I thought I wouldn't like it as much as holding a book, but I love it and it's wonderful for nighttime reading, and beach reading as well. Plus I can have a few books without carrying a ton."
1,It's fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire .
1,I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!
1,Love it.great addition to my 4K & Amazon Prime and unlimited music
1,Great for reading! Light is perfect and does not hurt your eyes. If you are always on the go the Kindle is for you!
1,Favorite part was how easy it is to read at night.
1,Met all my expectations & more! The amount of skills to select from is good. Can't wait to see what is upcoming.
1,"This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small."
1,"Just got my Echo... love the voice commands. Slight learning curve with the different commands. App to set up process takes time to set up different music, weather, local news, traffic, etc. Time consuming but once everything is set up, works great."
1,"I have owned a few more similar products including the fire stick. The stick works on but the TV work great! Zero lag, runs like a top, streams perfectly! Its the perfect start for getting rid of your cable bill."
1,I bought the paperwhite for my mother for christmas. It was very easy to set up and excellent that you had it on Christmas eve!
1,"resolution a little low on the screen, but excellent tablet for the price"
1,"I travel a lot and stay at different hotels...it works perfect for this. It allows me to sign-in to the hotel Internet page for the verification, without having to get it added to the hotel via the Internet administrator. I get all the applications I need and even added those extra that make it more personalized. Great product and the price was just right."
1,"Everything you need in a tablet !! Fast shipping, thank you."
1,Very good device for reading. Love the screen. Makes reading easy and comforatble
1,I recommend this tablet for beginners it definitely does the job needed to keep little ones entertained.Worth the money great price
1,"I purchased this for my Mother-in-Law. She wanted the Bible put on it. I loved it for myself! I almost kept it. it was great, but I already have an iPad."
1,"Bought this after dropping cable. The Vue is the only subscription (about $35 month) that offered NFL NETWORK, SEC, and ESPN with DVR like capabilities...PlayStation offers a cloud service included. Minor issues with the app. So far it is definitely worth it. I suggest researching which channels PlayStation Vue offers to compare with what you currently watch. You do need a smart tv and high speed internet with a great connection."
1,"I should have bought the Echo when it was released.. I was skeptical as to its value in my home. A friend had a Dot and liked it OK but didnt use it much after awhile. I decided to try it for myself and bought a Dot. I liked it enough to buy a Tap for bedroom.. I was not to impressed with the audio so naturally I purchased the Echo. The Dot is somewhere and I use the Tap and Echo every day. timers, news, music, weather, spell something, etc,"
1,"I love my kindle, i did a lot of research and this was the best option for me, i don't regret buying it."
1,"I bought 2 of these Amazon - Fire - 7"" Tablet - 8GB - tablets.One for an elderly friend in her late 60's and she does great with it.Also bought one for my 11 year old granddaughter. Easy to use and quick response to downloads and window changes. I have been recommending it to lots of people who are short on cash but need a really good tablet."
1,Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full
1,The Amazon Fire TV is very easy to setup works faster than Fire Stick because of a Ethernet connection.
1,"Bought two as gifts for our daughters. Thought since they recently started to read books again and would buy the actual books or try to read them on their phones, it would make a perfect gift. They love to be able to download books from Amazon and be able to use it as a tablet with tons of entertainment at their fingertips."
1,So far my Amazon purchases have been great and easy to use.
1,"It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it's a great service"
1,I love my echo. I know that some of you will be saying what do I really need this for but once you have it you will use it and love it.
1,Makes charging time quicker.
1,Purchased 2nd one as a gift. Use it everyday. Highly recommended
1,I was in line at a store where a elder women was trying to return a Amazon tablet. The customer service rep told her she used a charging block that had caused damage to the tablet and it wasn't covered for replacement. I happy to purchase a charging block that was made for my device.
1,"Great device, and has great sound. The voice activation is very tight, and once you realize how Alexa answers, she's very helpful.."
0,"I have not been able to get alexa to answer most questions and it is difficult to figure out how to delete your prior questions.... I think it is more of a novelty and good for playing music, but if you think you will be getting great info, your online web search is far better, this is very basic."
1,Very good for my 6 year old boy who likes to play games
1,"I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs."
1,"Was not sure I would like or use Echo that much, but now that I have installed and using, it is great for questions, notifications and keeping me up to date."
1,This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.
1,"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
1,One of the best streaming devices I have used. A++
1,Great tablet works good surfing the Web. And for my small child to listen to story books. He can see the screen very well. Since he has visual difficulty
1,This is a great tablet for the price. Works great and is easy to operate.
1,Great for my 8 year old she loves it. She got it for christmas and plays with it everyday.
1,This is a great tablet for the price and is easy for my kids to use they love it
1,I really love the Echo. I actually bought it to listen to music but I use it for many other things.
0,"Good beginner tablet, Light enough for small hands to carry. I got the cover as well which was a good investment as little hands tend to drop things. Not a lot of space, but enough."
1,The Echo has great sound quality and is amazing in the ability to play music.
1,"Great for beginners, I had one and then I got my stepson one."
1,This is for my son he loves it works for his games
0,"this is a great pad device, big and good display. just you have to familiar with the amazon OS and they build it for E-book, so it will a little bit slow for even web site surfing.more serious in game playing."
1,"I have both the Apple TV and the Amazon Fire TV. I wish I would have saved my money originally and purchased the Amazon Fire TV, I have all the apps I want and being an Amazon Prime member, it makes the device even more worth while being able to stream music. The remote and the interface are user friendly and astetically pleasing. Since I picked up the Amazon Fire, I haven't turned my Apple TV on once."
1,Does what I wanted and then more. I would recommend this to others.
1,"I baught thus tablet as an E-reader, for that purpose, it works great. It is also very good for watching streaming video."
1,Bought a digiland for the same price and had too many issues! Bought this for my daughter who is 9 and she uses it with ease. My son has also had one since January 2016 and no problems.
1,Great cheap Netflix watching tool for the children
1,You will have a lot of fun playing with echo during the holidays
1,My daughters love it it is probably one of the best tablets ive ever bought
1,Perfect size for on the go. Some apps aren't compatible due to it being an Amazon tablet vs Android. But an overall good purchase.
1,This is a great product! It integrates great with my smart home devices and it's easy to use. I just wish it had more google-like search capabilities.
1,The amazon stick very nice and easy to set up.i would recommend it
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is a compact e-reader that is so easy to use and download books - many of which are free from various websites. The light is great so one can read in a dim hotel light or in the dark.
1,"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
1,Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
1,I loved the tablet...does what it suppose to do...
1,"New model Paperwhite purchased on first day of release. It is as advertised. Lightweight, easy to read in bright light, adjustable brightness, text size and style and connects to my Kindle library with available wifi.But that's all. No access to any program or games except to buy another book."
1,Being its were on sale I bought it after use I found Excelent
1,Sound quality amazing! So much fun! Enjoy it every day!
1,My husband and I have really enjoyed our Echo more than we even thought we would. Love the ability to turn lights on/off. Along with monitoring our Nest.
1,Works very well. Was able to get it to work with my tablet and all our Samsung phones. Easy to setup family app's with Amazon prime.
1,"I bought this for my 91 year old mother. She had a kindle, but there were too many buttons and she had difficulty using it. She still has difficulty using this kindle, but likes it much better. There is only one button to press."
1,My old tablet died..needed a new fast. This one was alot better than my old one. Clear screen videos look amazing..Sound is better than expected..It was in stock too. Overall very happy item and buying experience!
1,Bought for kids. Happy with purchase.May get one for myself
1,"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
1,This was (and still is) a great price for this tablet. Newly added expanding expandable storage helps with storage issues. Included ac adapter and cable.
1,Good buy nice screen great battery life quick good video quality
1,I bought it for my kid and he has loved it. Would recommend.
1,My daughter loves the Amazon Fire tablet that I purchased for her!
1,A decent tablet. Just wish the app store had some better apps to download.
1,I had one of the original Kindles and I found that I just absolutely quit reading and it was because of the bulk and size of the Kindle. I decided to give this one a try and I absolutely love it and I'm back to reading every day and the reason is because it is more the size of a paperback. It's lightweight and I love that I can read at night without having have a light on. I did however purchase The Geek Squad protection after my dog that was sitting in my lap almost said it flying to the floor when he jumped up out of my lap
1,"This was my first e-reader and I was blown away. Great battery life, great screen. It's definitely worth it if you like reading."
1,"It's the perfect tablet for a the price, does everything a more expensive tablet does."
1,Simply amazing! Very easy to use and lots of fun. Highly recommend
1,"This is a gift to my daughter, she likes to play games and web browsing with it, and she is very happy with this tablet."
1,Grandkids fight over this. My daughter also uses this. Very good and user friendly. Would buy again.
1,"This kindle is lightweight and a great travel, break and extra free time companion. You can read it anywhere. Love it!"
1,Best investment in a tablet ever. It takes good videos which I used a lot for my sisters competitions. Can type a paper. Light and easy to use. Purchased all my school text books on here instead of carrying 50 pounds. Battery lasts. And good to watch movies on. Absolutely love it add a memory card to it and you'll be able to use it for whatever and wherever.
1,Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.
1,This device is great for my 4-year old! It does have a lot of preloaded apps and advertisements that we don't like though.
0,Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
1,I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus
1,Fire tv is fast and easy to use. It is easy to navigate.
1,Like the price. We have 5 kids so these tablets are the way to go. One of the negatives is that if you drop it its very fragile. And you can not get Instagram on these tablets which bummed my older kids.
1,My son loves it he downloads games and music... he watches movies on it he loves it.
1,"Its a good tablet. Fast, durable and easy to use. I especially love the parental features that are available. I am more of a fan of android tablets but for a little toodler this is far better."
0,"Absolute junk, don't waste your money. Bought for wife for a Christmas gift. Would not connect to Wi-Fi at my house. Useless!"
1,"Bought this for my son(11). We all love Alexa. She will sing songs, tell jokes, get you caught up on news, play music,alarms, control lights and so much more. Really fun electronic to have."
1,A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
1,The Fire TV is a really nice box for streaming. Turns your TV viewing into a whole new experience.
1,A great convience for a busy person when needing info and organization help
1,I needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. This paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.
1,Great item. The sound is good. The microphone is very sensitive. Alexa is good and hopefully will get smarter with more added features.
1,This is an amazing device for $50 . Nothing more to say!
1,Would completely recommend this product offers everything we were looking for in a movie box system
1,"Works wonderfully, charges quickly."
1,"This thing is awesome. Gives weather , news and traffic. Plus sets timers plays music and understands you. You can even call people"
1,"I thought I could read from my ipad, was a I wrong! Using this Kindle is amazing and I will never read from my ipad again AND I feel like I am holding a book again, great work!"
1,i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play.
1,It was a gift for my mother-in-law and she loves it.
1,Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
1,"We have so enjoyed our Echo. It helps me with my calendar, spells words for us, tells us the weather, etc."
1,Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
1,If you are looking to explore what AI can offer in your daily life then Amazon Alexa is your answer.
1,"Bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves it. The case makes it so much easier for little hands to hold. He's dropped it a few times and it's pretty solid, no scratches!"
1,"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere ."
1,I bought for my daughter to keep her busy and it works great!
1,"Very useful device that is useful in many ways including music, news,and help such as recipes."
1,This tablet from Amazon can do most things like the bigger more expensive tablets at a fraction of the cost. The two complaints I have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery does not last as long as an Ipads. Other than that it has plenty of apps and things that it can do like Netflix etc.
1,Great tablet from a great company will stay with this company for all other tablet purchases
1,"This is the eighth kindle fire I have gotten, I love them! I got one for all the members of my family"
1,good
1,"Have to learn to talk to it properly, it can do things with WeMo better than reviewed."
1,Echo has many possibilities--- we don't get to far into them. Mostly we use to stream music and news sources. The device is active in our day to day....It reads me then news while I make coffee-- We also use it to order an Uber.Highly recommend
1,"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!"
1,"Pick up 2 for my girls who are preteens, and for the price it does everything plus more. I can monitor them without them knowing. Links straight to your amazon account, would highly recommend this."
1,I can finally get back to reading thanks to my new Kindle paperwhite. It's small and lightweight along with a perfect anti-glare reading pane. This is my first e-reader and I love it. The paperwhite is a must as I have no eyestrain as I do when reading on regular computer screens. Intuitive and easy to use!
1,Got this tablet for my daughter and it has been good for her. Size and weight is just right for her small hands. Only draw back is you can only get apps that amazon has developed. Not able to get android apps on it.
1,The tablet is fast and my daughter loves it. She can play on it and also read books.
1,"This is my son's 1st smart phone and so far, it does what he needs it to do."
1,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
1,"With my love of turning paper pages in a book and not being a techie, I held off rushing into buying one of the many tablet readers available. I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews and talking to others before making my decision, and I am so glad I did my research. What I like most about the Kindle Paperwhite: the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eyes, whether I am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside; the ease of syncing it with my computer and wifi; the speed of downloading a book; the ability to adjust the font size; the ability to bookmark and pick up from where I stopped reading; and the size and weight which makes it very portable. I opted for an envelop-style sleeve for storage rather than a cover you might use for an iPad or similar tablet. It's easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading. I am thrilled with this device and give it two thumbs up. For me, there is no substitution for the feel of real paper, but this reader comes close."
1,Enough memory not any lag on loading programs.......
1,I own a kindle fire hd 1st gen. No issues still to this day. Battery is still like new after 3 + years of use. I bought this new Kindle for a gift and its been running great with no issues. Bought myself a samsung tab 4. Junk. This kindle even boots faster than the tab 4. Touch screen much better than the tab 4.
1,"I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017"
0,Love being able to just ask it to do things however there is a learning curve. You have to also kind of teach it what you want.
1,"I have bought 5 kindles over the last several years, 1 for me and the rest for gifts. Haven't had any problems with any of them."
1,Still working on getting to explore all the features.
1,Cant beat the price for a tablet. This is the best bang 4 buck.
1,Nice set up. Hopefully they will add more apps. But I'm very satisfied.
1,"Great nifty kindle that allows you to read books at ease and also use it for other apps to stream shows and movies. Also has its own version on word, excel, and powerpoint which is easy to use"
1,My four year is very tech savvy better than some adults!Great for shaping her real world experiences.
1,"This tablet is great. Because it's from Amazon, you can easily switch to a different profile and use it when the kids finally put it down. I have 2 1/2 year old twins and it's hard to get them to sit down. With the Kid's Kindle Fire, they are more than happy to settle down on the couch and play. I highly recommend buying one. It is a life saver!"
1,"Bought as Christmas gift. She loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
1,"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
1,"this was a gift for my mom, she loves it!!! works great"
1,Bought this e reader for my son who loves it. After being on computers all day it is great to be able to relax and read on the flat paperwhite screen. Wi-Fi great so you can download book almost anywhere.Comfort of a real book with technology to assist with purchases. Best combination !
1,"Love the size of the tablet for travel, it responds to touches quickly and has a great picture!"
1,"I love, love my Echo. At a command it will play any songs my mood dictates at that moment."
1,the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too.
1,SO FAR SO GOOD I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT I PURCHASED
1,It is my third kindle. The reading experience with kindle is always good.
1,My son love it can't do anything without his Amazon fire on his hand.
1,"I would recommend this Amazon smart tv device, very easy setting up and remote on this Amazon smart tv amazing. I will get this device again"
0,"Got 3 of them, great cost for what you get. My kids are down to only one left. Killed 2 of them sadly. Setting up can be a pain. Kids keep asking to add more apps. You have to delete the old to add more. I'm starting to dislike them more then the kids like them."
1,"I love this tablet for reading and letting my son who is 4 play games on it. The resolution is not the best in the world but I do not use it to watch movies for hours on end. I wish it was not locked to the Amazon market so that I could get a wider selection of apps than offered, but still good buy nun the less."
1,Great value for a great virtual assistant. A good start for initiating a smart home.
1,"UNBELIEVABLE, CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT IT CAN DO, EVEN MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES IT."
1,My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math.
1,"Got this for someone as a gift and they enjoy it, asking for the weather while doing other things around the house or having your favorite music play. I've tested it and am amazed and what it can do, look forward to what it will be capable of in the future."
1,"Brought reading inside, outside in the bright sunlight and even bedtime reading back into view! Great product and a must have !"
1,"Purchased as a gift. It was a good choice. It is as advertised,"
1,Skeptical at first - did a lot of research & was a vanity purchase that has turned into one of the most function home devices I own! Timer in the kitchen - done. Quick weather check - done. Order something from Amazon - done. Throwing a party & need tunes + great speaker - done. Alexa will continue to get better & the Echo gets smarter as you use it.
1,I had an older Kindle Paperwhite. Went to visit family & forgot to bring it. Purchased this new one. I love it. My husband is now using my old one. I won't go anywhere without my Kindle.
1,Nice tablet. Screen is clear even though not high level HD. Amazon features with android capabilities work well!
1,I have apple tablets and bought the kindle for a book reader. It is truly the best tablet for the price! It works well and the option for added memory is a huge plus! :)
1,"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
1,Was a great birthday present for my son that only gets to use it when it's absolutely necessary.
1,Works great we use it everyday and love to ask questions
1,"Lightweight, and I like being able to read outside with no glare."
1,"I've been playing with this for a few weeks. It is not perfect, but it is great for listening to music and audiobooks. I don't like watching the news, so the ""Flash Briefing"" is very nice. Sometimes it does not get the full headline, but I get the gist of it, and I don't have to go through the depressing details. I'm looking forward to learning how to create my own skills for it. The speaker isn't the best I've ever heard, but it's definitely not the worst. The IFTTT integration is great, and I have setup triggers to many devices in my house and the Shopping List is great."
1,Easiest way for me to buy books for him to read. I'm an Amazon prime member and this is an easy download.... plus he loves reading on the fire!
1,I wasn't too sure about getting a tablet at first. I've had an iPhone for years and have always loved reading hard cover books. I was also concerned that I would have a hard time learning the software other than apple. I'm happy to report that the software was not difficult to adjust to in the least and I thoroughly enjoy reading on a tablet now!
1,"Best gift ever, now she leaves mom and dads phones/tablets alone and plays his own, which is also locked down as well. And thanks to the low price, I bought for his siblings as well, there is peace now"
1,Great service. So far have bought three. One for me and two gifts. Everyone likes it.
1,We upgraded from the dot to the Echo and we are glad we did!!!
1,I love this new tablet because it has expandable memory.
1,This devise is awesome you can do so much with this adult toy makes life easier at times highly recommend
1,everything from hest buy is working perfect i like that
1,"I love my Echo. Started with an Echo Dot last year at Christmas and I was hooked. I bought an Echo Tap for my husband for his birthday to be able to take outside on the patio or when working in the garage, and now we have a full-sized Amazon Echo.I am now so used to ""talking to the air"" that it is weird not to always precede everything with ""Alexa"""
1,For the money (if you can do without Apple) this is the best tablet. You just have to remember Amazon sells it cheap so you have access to their media services and Alexa.
1,"I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad."
1,Purchases this 7 inch tablet almost three weeks ago and have been very happy about it. It's perfect for reading. Web browsing and watching Amazon prime videos.
1,An excellent tablet at a low cost. It more than met my expectations for basic use such as video watching and gaming.
1,"Now own echo DOT, Echo TAP and the ECHO. Recommend all highly"
1,Bought this instead of the echo dot and I'm glad I did. The speaker on this is really good. Very useful product.
0,"Ok for a beginner or young person, or someone just learning the technology."
1,"Easy set up, basic tablet, outstanding price. Plus you get all the great features and access to Amazon content. Great selection of apps and several parental control options for children (If you're looking for those controls)"
1,"I had been using a Kindle Fire HD for a couple of years, but over time found I was mainly using it for reading. I had been considering switching to a pure ereader for a while, but was not convinced until I saw some specs on the Voyage. I ordered it right away and have been very happy with it."
1,"This is my second Paperwhite, great for reading outdoors."
1,"It is good tablet if you do not high expectations of performance, good for traveling by car and use to see maps or give to kids"
1,"For the money, a great Android like tablet that works"
1,I like the paperwhite. It's a good size. Only drawback is the ads on the lockscreen! I can't see how to get rid of them. I like the old display of authors better.
1,Product is great and battery life is long. My kids and i enjoy using it to read long and short novels. It is a must get to have. Great to take with you to bed and read with low dim!
1,"gift for mom,perfect for her enjoyment,good picture"
1,"But to build on and if you use it, it's convenient to have and can be taught many skills."
1,The price is great. My granddaughter loves it. Thanks.
1,This was a really good product. I really enjoy streaming movies and TV shows.
1,Great tablet for the money!! Easy to use! Easy to set up. Great for reading or browsing the Internet.
1,"Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot."
1,"A friend and my neighbors have Echo Dot. After talking with them, I purchased one and am very pleased with it. Especially, I like being able to listen to my favorite local radio stations, as well as Sirius/XM. The sound quality is excellent."
1,Liked the first one so much I bought one for the wife
1,"The two main purposes I use the Echo for are the flash news briefing and as a bluetooth speaker. Alexa isn't any more intuitive than Siri, or Google Assistant."
1,It's great I gave it as a gift to a family member and they can't get off of it .
1,A steal of a deal on Black Friday and a great gift for young readers
0,Bought for my daughter. She likes it just for reading books.
1,"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
0,"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
1,"We love the kindle. I intended to purchase a single unit for my husband, who had lost his, and ended up with one for each of us."
0,Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.
1,Love this device for reading. I travel for a living so it's great not carrying a bulky book with me. Plus doesnt bother my eyes after reading for hours
0,Not as comprehensive as I thought.Basic questions avaid her perview.I hope there will be some software upgrades soon.
1,This is the best kindle yet. Love the features and soft back-lighting.
1,"I can only compare this to the previous Kindle and is far superior in all aspects but one, the battery. The battery is a lot less reliable and I do not mean by use, the other way. I was used to left my previous kindle several days without to later come back and use it with a decent amount of battery left. In this case I have found this more than once empty."
1,purchased to replace an old tablet to have around and for children. everyone likes it
1,I bought one of these for me and my son. They are great tablets for the price. The resolution is great! Obviously you aren't getting the speed of a $600 or $700 tablet but I was surprised at how quick they were. I will continue to buy every new Amazon Fire tablet that comes out. You can't beat it for the price and you can upgrade every year if they make a new one. You could upgrade every year for more than 10 years for the price of one ipad.
1,goes great for amazon prime users. The user interface is easy to navigate and is awesome for personal use.
1,Makes life easier and allow you to save lot of time
0,"I want to rate it 3.5 but best buy lets me rate it 3 or 4, nothing in between. Similarly I see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a 300 ppi display. Kindle Paperwhite is good but not much has changed over the years, if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending.A paperwhite with 3G goes up towards 180-200 USD, I would rather invest the money on a tab. If you are sticking with the base version as I brought (99 USD - no ads), then its a good deal."
1,Great product. Fast shipping. I can't wait to learn more of what Echo can do
1,"Got this for my nephew and he loves it, hard to get him to put it down"
1,"This is actually my second Kindle, as I left on a trip and forgot mine at home, and I didn't want to be without it! The paper white, wihich can be used outside in the glaring sun, makes it a huge winner for me!"
1,"Love the product, specially the backlight feature."
1,I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
1,Great inexpensive tablet. My wife had an ipad 2 and she has not said once she wants an ipad instead.
1,"It has so many uses it is scary. I, however just use it mostly to listen to music. I has a very good speaker for its size. I ( or should I say Amazon- Echo) can always find something to please the mood I am in."
1,Awesome product for a great price. Love the rewards program.
1,This is very easy to handle and perfect for the kids
1,"Echo is an excellent gizmo for people on the Amazon eco system. It does/has many things - music, weather, news, jokes, trivia, Bluetooth, speaker, good mics, home automation integration, calendar etc. It lacks an advanced capacity for web search which I suspect it's competition from Google may have. It also lacks in smart TV integration. Some other nice to have would have been a battery in it making it a little bit mobile and integration with other intranet speakers. Overall a good idea and one that will get better over time."
1,I purchased this item as a gift for Christmas. Would have liked to have more memory with tablet.
1,"Gave it to my grandkids(ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
1,"I've had my Echo now for a month. It was easy to set up, it interprets both my commands and my wife's commands very well and we continue to find helpful ways to use it day-to-day."
1,"Had a roku and wanted to compare how the FIRE TV performed. Ya can't lose with either one. If you see one of these FIRE TV on the shelf, grab it as they don't stay on the shelf long."
1,"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
1,So simple to set up a caveman could do it and still have time to get some reading in!
1,"Love the Echo so much. It really answers your questions, love the skills, and love the music."
1,Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
1,"I like this one because it has vocabulary list, you can save new words in vocabulary list and review them until you master new words."
1,My family and I love our Amazon Fire TV it is much faster than our Apple TV and with Amazon Prime there are a ton of free shows and movies to watch
1,We got one hesitantly and then we signed up for Amazon's unlimited music service. It is great while I am washing dishes I can tell it what I want to listen to and my wife loves it while she cooks. Its nice being able to tell the speaker what you want to hear when you have dirty hands from cooking or cleaning.
1,"Bought as a gift for young relative, she loves it. Easy set up with parental controls."
1,Best reader in sunshine and darkness. Easy to use and re-load.
1,I can play all my games that I play on Facebook and much more.
1,I purchased this for my son and he loves it. He does vary basic things like play games and watch videos but it works perfect for that
1,Bought this for my Godmother and she loves it. She is visually impaired and the large font works great for her.
1,Our grand daughter is very happy with her fire kids edition. Product wotks great.
1,I am very pleased with this tablet. Small enough to take with me anywhere yet a large enough screen for reading anywhere.
1,"Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!"
1,"Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved ."
1,"Got my mom this kindle for her birthday, she absolutely loves it. Battery lasts long, good quality camera and easy to use!"
1,We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.
1,Good product for streaming TV shows and Movies even better than the Firestick.
1,"Love this device, the only concern is that sometimes it doesn't hear commands especially when it plays music or tv is on"
1,Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
1,Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product.
1,The Echo works really well for us. We stream music on it almost every day and my wife loves it. We weren't big Amazon users in the past so we don't use all of its functions but they just added a function that links it to our family calendar app and now we can add items to our grocery list just by asking Alexa.
0,"Just bought my Kindle Fire and although the ""Amazon"" and ""Fire"" come up otherwise the product is dead!!!!!!! I have tried the help section but no help. Taking it back to the store. If it would work I would love it."
1,"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office."
1,"We have tied in our thermostat, asked about the olympics, listened to Pandora and Amazon Prime and it's told us jokes! We have loved this toy."
1,So far I really am enjoying this. I can ask it to play any music and so many other things. I'm still learning. Bought it to listen to music in the garage. I'm not disappointed. Have a radio out there but it's hard to get a station in
1,Great tablet for the price. It's very easy to use.
1,Amazon fire tv is great product. Wish the voice command option was more user friendly.
1,"Echo will quickly become your best friend. Her sound is clear and crisp. Music is fabulous. She takes notes, make lists, read to you, make jokes and the list goes on!"
0,We returned this item after 2 weeks. It took a lot of repeated request to get it to listen to us and it just wasn't as easy to use as I thought it would be.
1,Fine. Works as expected.
1,"Awesome gadget to have in the household. Even more of a plus when you link it to all the supporting smart devices like nest, etc"
1,It is a very solid E-Reader. Nothing wrong with it at all.
1,Got this for my daughter and mother I'll law for Christmas and they both love them.good price and seems to b a quality tablet
1,Great tablet for the price! Highly Recommended! Comes with ads is the only downside
1,"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
1,This was a birthday gift for my daughter but I must say I want one for myself! Great sound and easy to operate.
1,Device is user friendly. Very easy to navigate and much faster than the FireStick. Can also install Kodi unlike other streaming devices.
1,"Great product perfect for my needs at home. Used for my TV remote to Roku, radio apps wireless connection to my sound bar and fast browser all in one. I only paid $35 for this device brand new from best buy."
1,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
1,I love love love my fire tablet...i was surprised by the ease in using it
1,"first fire is great, purchased a second as a gift and its perfect."
1,"Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can't beat it for the price."
1,"This has much more space than the fire stick. Because of the extra memory space, the spreed and quality is great, to include less buffering."
1,Right size for travel. Perfect for reading. Everyone should own one.
1,Got the Amazon fire tablet for my daughter n she loves it. It had some good games n learning stuff on it n she needs that at the age of 4.
1,Love to listen to music based on artistGreat to have on patio also
1,we liked bringing the latest technology into our home
1,Purchased this as a gift for outdoor reading in the sun etc. It works quite well and was proved reasonably.
1,Great alternative to cable. I have purchased these for several of my family members. I have a 70 inch 4K tv and the picture is clear. The device is user friendly and can get many apps.
1,Good product!
1,"Doesn't have the all the features of a tablet but if you want to read in the sun, the paper white is the best option."
1,awesome buy for the price. camera rated 5 out of 10
1,"Bought this for access to Amazon programming and I'm liking it better than my Apple TV. I don't have the newest Apple TV, so I can't comment on that product, but this one is fast and has a couple of key buttons on the remote that make navigating easier than my apple. I also love the 4K content streaming perfectly!"
1,Surprised my husband with the Amazon Echo. He is enjoying learning all about its capabilities
1,Its a good product at a good price. I got it for my 8 year old and it serves the purpose.
1,"before I bought this I really underestimated how much I would be using it! sounds great, it even has a good low base response and good highs and mid range.thinking of buying another for the bedroom soon."
1,I love this. And it's great that they keep making improvements!!
1,"I have had a nook for years and had a difficult time switching over to kindle despite the amazing reviews, but I couldn't pass up the price of this product. I was very pleasantly surprised with how great it is and I now use it all the time. I'm even thinking about getting my toddler one for christmas."
1,"i am still learning all its features great alarm, music, spelling and somewhat internet helpful i am very satisfied with this ourchase"
1,"This is my 3rd Echo purchase. Setup is a breeze, and Alexa is so helpful. We use her most often for kitchen timers, playing music and weather reports. Highly recommended!"
1,"For years I have used my very basic Kindle e-reader, but had difficulty in dim lighting. I am thrilled with the backlit screen on my new Kindle Paperwhite."
1,"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
1,These are wonderful items. Easy to use and work. Fast service and saves on my cable bill.
0,"IT WORKED AS EXPECTED, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ABOUT A USB DEVICE"
1,Amazon Product is good and it is handy. It is useful while travelling.
1,Took sometime to learn all the things it can do. Very easy to set up.
1,Makes book downloading and reading easy as ever. So compact and lightweight too.
1,I'm very proud to have one of these. Best product I've purchased so far
1,Got this for my nephews and they love love love it!
0,"Very low quality tablet. It lags on games. But what do you expect for $50? However, you can still do most things you'd expect to do with a tablet."
1,Great family streaming eliminate cable all together.
1,"Awesome! Unbeatable price! You can buy books and stuff! Magazines, games or whatever! Keeps my wife quiet for hours! Thank you Amazon!!!!"
1,One of best purchases. This is a must for any man cave.
1,"It's helpful, love playing games! She answering my questions help"
1,I bought the kindle at a very nice price and everything works well. I like it.
1,"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
1,Best if you have amazon prime but you don't need it.
1,Works good. Still has buffering issues. Otherwise no problems.
1,I needed to replace my Kindle fire that was damaged. It works great .
1,"I was skeptical about the uses for the Amazon Echo and of Alexa but after using it for several weeks, I enjoy the ease of interaction and the accuracy of Alexa. The sound quality from the speaker is very good and I often use the Echo as my go-to audio device when I'm needing some background music for reading, cooking, cleaning, etc."
1,Great product... Had gone to Walmart... Priced very expensive... Best Buy saved the day...
1,Used while traveling in southeast Asia to pick up emails & stay in touch with friends & family back in the States
1,"It's perfect for kids, and adults who want to take a tablet on the go, and not worry so much! It seams very durabale."
1,"Paperwite is easy to hold, as I have weak wrists. Light weight and so easy to turn pages. Books download in seconds. With the light it is great to be able to read anywhere. Very small so it fits in my purse or a large pocket. I thought it would be hard to read because of it`s size but you can enlarge the letters to suit yourself. Enjoy the compatibility of this little jewel. It`s Great, don't hasatate to buy yours as you will be very pleased."
1,"This is one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I use the echo to control my Nest thermostat, my lights, my sprinkler, pretty much almost everything connected to my Wink."
1,Bought this item for my son and he loves it it works great for movies and games that he likes to play its the perfect size for a toddler ! Can't beat the price or how great it works
1,Product is awesome. I love it it's easy to use and is fast.
1,This was my second e reader and I love it easy to operate along with a lot of apps available.
1,Awesome speaker and home automation control. Very recommended.
1,Very educational and simply fun...like a new friendHavi g too much fun with her....still exploring more to educate her even better...a must myst buy and i dont typically buy gadgets....
1,An exceptional product which can be upgraded with products in the future
1,Bought 3 PS4 games for a great price. And I just love my fire tablet
1,I love the Echo. It's super user friendly and the sound is great for the size.
1,Alexa is a terrific product that does exactly what it says it will do and the fact that it is always learning and growing makes it even more beneficial to your home I've used it for almost 3 weeks now and it is just like everybody says it is
1,"I purchased this item for my children, 7 and 11 it has been a good durable easy to use set up and use item."
1,This is the perfect starter media player for someone who is new to online media. Mom loves it
1,Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
1,"I previously had a first edition paper white and finally pulled the trigger on a voyage. I'm so glad I did, the resolution is great and it seems easier to read. I also like that the screen is completely flat. I don't really use the page turn buttons like I thought i would but it is nice to have the option."
1,I needed a new tablet to replace my toshiba that had died. The kindle fire is perfect!
1,Got this for my grand daughter to watch cartoons and play games. Once you get it into kids mode and locked down it works great. Very sturdy and stands up to kid abuse. Got it on sale so that helps.
1,"This was a gift for my sister. She never had a reader or tablet. Now she has both. Easy to use, nice size for traveling. great price!"
0,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
1,"I purchased this item as a travel companion. I use it for entertainment such as games, books and movies. It also comes in very handy when I need e-mailing, paying bills, etc. when away from home."
1,"This is my first ""e-reader"" i couldnt be happier!!"
1,The tablet is easy to set up and easy to use. Great tablet for family use.
1,very good product in its price range affordable and very good
1,One has to keep the price of this in mind. For just $40 you do indeed get a lot. It performs fairly well too for the most part. I didn't notice any lags or anything but the resolution isn't very high/good and it's not the best display if you plan on doing lots of reading. It's just fine for videos though.. The tablet has an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind.
1,"Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings."
1,"this is the best thing in town. i love how quick it responds to commands, i enjoy the nice quality of music all day long"
1,I have been an Apple user and this is my first Kindle as a gift from my husband. I am impressed with the display. Great price point. I don't like the ads that I have to put up with. I didn't know I have to pay to remove them. Thumbs down!
1,"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
1,This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.
1,Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
1,"The Kindle from Best Buy has made it easier for me to read. This is my first e-reader. I like the Voyage 6 for its brightness and speed, plus thelarge variety of reading material. I know Amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase Kindle books. However, I havefound several Kindle books available for free from my public library. I will, no doubt, buy some Kindle books elsewhere in the future. Best BuyHas been good to me. I did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who was well-informed on this product but finally got what I wanted."
1,Purchased these for our grandchildren ... great for children learning to use electronics.
1,"I love to read but I rarely have time these days. For those who do have the time, this is a great device because you can take it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation. The text is crisp and easy to see but I wish the screen was just a little bigger. I ultimately took this back and went with a Kindle Fire HD 8. The pros of a tablet outweighed the cons for my situation, but the Kindle Paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their books anywhere they go."
0,"Tablet is ok. It does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. But for the price, I can't really complain. I bought it at the $35 BF price. I wouldn't let me download Instagram for some reason either."
1,"Wonderful, it is for a toddler and a four year old, also a seven year old boy.They love it. A lot of the games I put on are educational.The toddler and the four year old like the puzzles and ballon poppingGames. The seven year old likes thinking games, so they are all happy.So am I."
1,This tablet has been wonderful for my 8 yr old son. The parental controls are perfect for making sure he doesn't purchase the wrong things.
1,easy to use really bright screen easy to see. worth the money
1,This is a great media device. Mostly use it for XBMC/KODI but has plenty of power for other functions
1,It was not what I went into the store for but it's what I left with
1,Internet sucks on this thing. They need to do something better. My phone is 3x faster.
1,Really cool device. Always finding something new to do with it
1,We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
1,"I went with the Amazon Fire TV due to its flexibility to sideload Android apps but also be more forgiving than the regular Android builds. If you have Amazon Prime, this is the only way to watch it on an Android box. I wish Amazon would update its apps as quickly as the Google Play store does but overall, I have no real complaints."
1,"Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound."
1,"My original power adapter has died. I purchased this. Works as designed, but even more, it's clearly a better engineered replacement unit. You can physically see the difference, from the connector cable, to the transformer body."
1,"Got this while on sale & used Best Buy points ! Got it for super cheap . Being a Prime member makes this worth while. So far the Fire TV has performed flawlessly. There are many apps to choose from, some not available on my Apple TV . This box is 4K ready with some Prime eligible titles to stream . The interface is not quite as nice as Apple TV but works ok . I would say it is worth what I paid and then some !"
1,"This is great for the entire family! Love this device to watch shows, movies and even play games!"
1,"HD 8"" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included."
1,"It kind of small yes, but very practical if you do not want to buy I pad mini"
1,It is great to have numerous books right at your finger tips. Especially while traveling. Bought this for a backpacking trip and have used it nearly everyday since.
1,Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
1,Good value for the money...easy to set up and use. Would recommend to anyone
1,Awesome deal awesome price and nowadays who needs a pc when u can get a tab
1,This is by far something great to stream and the programs you can download to it are great. Worth the money if you know what you know what you are using it for.
0,Needs some user interface improvements. The screen is decent for the price of the tablet.
1,My kids love theirs. No problem out of this tablet.
1,"This was a gift for my grandmother and she loves it. It's easy to use, portable, and the battery last long."
1,This Amazon fire TV stick is faster than the older versions. I have not had any buffering while using this device.
1,"For the money, this is a steal. Highly recommend. My wife loves it."
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great tool and has a ton of cool features. Amazon is constantly adding features and tips/tricks to use with ""Alexa"". I like having my Prime Music playlist going. It's very handy when I'm backing and need to ask a question and my hands are dirty to use my phone to google. What I don't like is that it has to be plugged in the entire time. You will need to purchase a remote to use it in another room. Hopefully they'll fix this with a newer model."
1,Nice Amazon Product to have it. Magnolia configured it with my Home theater system and works well!!
1,The Tablet was better than expected.Excellent Choice on my part.
1,IS A VERY GOOD LEARNING TOOL TO LEARN A LOT OF THINGS
1,This tablet is great for reading. It is also very snappy from app to app.
1,My husband loves it. He is definitely reading more since he got it!
1,Great addition to the house from everything for playing music on demand a timer ocean sounds at night and the skills are always expanding well worth the purchase
1,I purchased it for my dad and he has had no complaints. He's able to download all the games easily and fast.
1,"I am using my second kindle and this third one was a gift for my 83 year old mother in law, very user friendly"
1,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
1,"I love this device more then I thought I would. It's slim and lightweight. Fits very nicely into my small purse. The resolution is great. I really like the built in light. I do miss the built in keyboard I had on my previous Kindle but I'm OK with that. It does not have the speaker either but I never used them to begin with. The key things for me were the price, resolution, font and built in light. This device met all my requirements. Additionally, I purchase all my electronics from Best Buy and have loved the service I have received each and every time. They have truly earned my continued loyalty."
1,"I'm not big reader. Since the purchase, I have been reading a lot more! Even recipies!! I love this kindle! My boyfriend bought one the exact same time, then bought some cute cases for them."
1,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!"
1,Awesome tablet. Purchased for kids. They love it..
1,"Simply amazing! Forgot how much I love having music on in the background during the day and with access to Prime Playlists it's an outstanding deal. Weather forecasts, ""who's that actor that was in...."", set an alarm for a reminder, add items to shopping list, trivia questions-you name it, Alexa does it. Tell her goodnight, and she responds kindly with goodnight. Been on the fence for awhile about purchasing this and now I am so glad I went for it"
1,works great in bright sun also. downloads fast and is compact so I can take it anywhere.
1,Great! I had a friend set it up for me. Enjoy music at command.
1,It is a great addition to my home office. My Alexa is upstairs.
1,I have had one for about six months now an it's amazing so I had to buy another one for my baby girl an she love it also...
1,I bough this tablet for my father and he loves it. It's pretty simple for him to use.
1,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it!
1,Bought as gift for 8yr old. It's not too complicated and perfect size for use of kids!! Excellent choice
1,I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
1,"WAS A GIFT FOR A 91 YEAR OLD MAN, ONCE I SET IT UP HE LOVES IT. AND USES IT EVERY DAY."
1,"Great screen, fast and responsive touch controls, and linked to Amazon for your apps. Overall, the best tablet you can find for under $50."
1,"I love the new kindle fire. I bought the original fire back in 2011 and this is definitely an upgrade. The firmware is better, the battery last longer and the screen is better. All this for $40....can't beat that deal."
1,I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
1,My second one and works better than the first one.
1,I used this on a daily basis. One of the best gadget so far!
1,"It's not a $300 Samsung tablet. It's a $35-50 tablet, depending on the deal. But this thing packs so much entertainment (especially with a Prime membership) that it's hard to go wrong with the almost-disposable price."
1,Love it! Great customer service at Best Buy. Recommended to friends.
1,This is an excellent option. And it has Alexa built in.
1,This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
1,"Such a great tool. I really enjoy it. Voice control everything. We are still working on adding house automation with it, but its awesome so far."
1,"So far, works just as it should. Haven't used it over WiFi, as I have it direct connected to my modem. I love that it came with a remote, but wish it could use a universal one, but the phone app works just ads well, too. Wish there was an off button, not just sleep mode."
0,Great tablet for kids but the screen isn't as strong. Charging port is very poorly built
1,My kids enjoy reading and watching videos on it - good color
1,The device is one of the best especially if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. The Amazon Prime Music on the FireTV is the best music streaming device. The only issue I had is that the remote controler stopped working and I had to use the firetv app on my phone to control the device.
0,"Nice toy but not very useful unless you are controlling a house full of appliances, lights, etc. Also not a fan of Bing which is the search engine the Echo uses."
1,I was looking for an inexpensive tablet to help my daughter become more comfortable using technology. This tablet offers great parental controls and gives her the ability to watch & play age appropriate shows and games.
1,"Great little tablet for the price !! Bought it for the kids when they come over, can't beat it!"
1,"You can't get much better than this for the price. My only critique is that they might as well have not included the camera because it's useless, but if you're using a tablet for the camera than that is already an issue. Good quality resolution, fast for internet browsing, expandable memory. Lots of positives to be found here."
1,Nice and good tablet to do basic things like surfing.
1,"Easy to navigate, right size, in expensive, my granddaughter loved it"
1,Purchased as a gift. Quick ship. Great product. You can't go wrong with a kindle.
1,Gave this for a gift and they absolutely love it. Also purchased the stand so it won't tip over. Easy to use.
1,"i bought this for my 4yr old sister and a 32gb memorystick to put all her movies on it and it works great, but you have to find a app that plays it since the install one was a little hard to use for a kid"
1,"Purchased this for my 8yr old son, glad I did. This is not to much for him to handle. He's reading, playing games, and he loves it."
1,"Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced"
1,I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and very happy with it
1,I got this tablet on a deal and has good quality of video you can watch.
1,I've had my kindle fire 7.0 for more than 3 years. it works great but I wanted a bigger screen. I love it.
1,This tablet exceeded my expectations I thought it would be just a cheap tablet but it does more than a Thaler I bought for 200 buck great smart buy
1,Alexa is an incredible asset to our home and she even plays music for our dog when we are not at home.
1,"I still haven't used the camera, once I figure it out I will use it. I love the features on it. I use it for facebook mostly & emails. I also play some of the games on facebook.☺"
1,I am so happy I bought it. The sound is great and so very easy to use. Eventually would like to get another for upstairs.
1,its a christmas gift so have not even opened it yet
1,"THE FIRE TV WAS SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO USE CABLE OR SATELLITE AND IT""S WORKING."
1,"Very user friendly. Occasionally when I'm switching back and forth between sources, there is no picture, only sound so I have to turn it off and back on. Not sure if the problem is with the fire tv."
1,Has all the features I needed and more than expected. I opted for the 8gb but needed more due to the amount of space used for the many apps. Overall a great buy.
1,It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.
1,"Still getting use to using it,having trouble getting programs we like to watch"
0,The charger won't stay securely connected to the Paperwhite and wiggles. It will only charge when held at a particular angle.
1,This tablet is a thing of beauty. The entire family loves being on it. Works great.
1,The paper white version of Kindle is much easier to read than the older ones.Very happy with the quality and ease of use.
1,This has a great menu and its a lot easier to find then the apps on the tv. Its much quicker then the fire stick
1,also great for listening to music and also for movies
1,"Have a lot of fun with this. Listen to music, get the daily weather report and the news. Still learning how to use different things on it."
1,This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
1,"This was a gift for my elderly mother-in-law. She is thrilled with the fact that she can pull up any book she wants, at anytime, as she is an avid reader. It is also very easy for her to use, a BIG plus!"
1,Great ereader. Light and easy to use. Only issue is a bit pricey.
1,Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for.
1,Info and entertainment on command - can't beat it!
1,My 6yr old son loves the tablet!I plan on purchasing another Fire tablet!
0,"Not the best case Amazon has ever put out! I have a number of other Amazon brand Kindle and Kindle Fire cases for my various Kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch. It doesn't stand in any position, so I can't use my 6 hands free. It also doesn't line up properly when closed, so the Fire seems to come out of sleep mode, thus draining the battery more quickly. And finally, I have discovered that I do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from. I understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the Kindle Fire HD 6...not that this case was any bargain at 30!!"
1,"I use this tablet to control music on my surround sound home speaker system. It works great for that purpose. Streams directly to the receiver with no lag, and fits perfectly on the wall. Great device for this purpose"
1,Though it's entry level tablet it's not cheap technology. Amazon ecosystem is very competitive with Google and they're ahead with more rapid product line. Fire tablet is the proof of that. You can also get advantage of Alexa.
1,"This is a great budget tablet. Don't expect it to compare to an iPad, but it's great for the kids!"
1,Alexa is a helpful tool to use everyday. She gets better the more skills you have her learn.
1,This product was everything it was advertised f to be. I find new uses for it every day.
1,"This was a gift for my mom and she really likes it. However, there aren't a lot of apps to use with it."
1,"Bought to play my PlayStation Vue tv, love the Alexus feature overall a great thing for steaming."
1,Purchased this to replace old kindle that I had used for many years. The new kindle works great and is easy to read even in bright sunlight.
0,Had to return as the wifi was a little slow for my child's patience.
1,"Best thing invented. Love my Amazon stick, everyone should have one."
1,Luv the tablet and reading the books resolution is great
1,"This is a great little tablet. It is wonderful for reading, Going online and using apps. The only reason I gave it four stars was because there are a few apps that my family enjoy using that cannot be downloaded onto this tablet. Other then that you're definitely getting the most bang for your buck. The price just cannot be beat."
1,We bought this as a gift for a family friend. She uses it all the time for Netflix. She is really happy with it.
1,"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
1,This is great as a first tablet. It has Amazon underground for free apps. the only thing missing is no google play store:(
1,Great tablet for just paying a bill or surfing Internet
1,"We bought this for our son for Christmas, he's 9. It is exactly what he needed, plenty of games, he can watch videos, etc but I can feel safe with him using it thanks to the easily set parental controls."
1,Gift for the wife. She rea!ly likes it and uses it a lot.
1,The service and shopping experience was great. The products are amazing.
1,"Takes a bit to get used to talking to a device, but it works great for playing music, providing scores and news, and for controlling smart devices like lights in the kitchen."
1,Love the quality and price paid for this tablet. I use it whenever I'm taking the bus.
1,"Dropped FIOS TV, and Amazon Fire TV + HDTV Antenna was an easy replacement."
1,The graphics and sound on this tablet were better than expected!
1,"This is a great product, but I think I could've gotten the Fire Stick. Maybe someday I'll use it for what it's worth. But none the less, a great product."
1,Love this reader. I recently flew to Texas. My reader made the trip relaxing and a lot more bearable. I love the ease of use. This device is so much better than a pad for readers. You can tuck it in a pocket or purse easily.
1,Lost mine in an airplane and now feel relieved after getting a new one
1,My youngest son has the Kindle Kids but I got this for my 8 year old and he loves that he has more options.
1,"I have had an echo for a couple of years and absolutely love it, so when I saw them on sale, I decided to buy one for my classroom. They are well worth the price!"
1,This is a wonderful streaming box. It was easy to set up. There has been no lag and it provides channels I cannot get on my Apple TV. I absolutely love it.
0,don't care much for it you have to purchase any apps that r used on daily basis
1,"but it is missing some of the Google apps. I have not sideloaded those yet. The display is acceptable. If you have Amazon Prime, it does have a nice interface for using it."
1,"Great speaker, Love using voice commands, Even my granddaughters use the voice command to search for songs."
1,Really easy to use. Convient to have around for everyday things
1,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
1,"This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping!"
1,I bought this for my wife as a gift and she and the rest of the family love it.
1,"My Grandson loves this tablet. With all of the Apps, and the Games also!"
1,More memory and better resolution than prior iterations. Much better for reading books versus a conventional tablet due to fewer distractions. Easier on the eyes.
1,I don't know how Amazon makes any money selling these. The quality is beyond what you pay.
1,This is my 3rd Kindle by far the best one . Love it
1,"Worth every penny, if you set it up correctly....."
1,The tablet seems to be working well so far. It is easy to use. Has a good volume sound.
1,This tablet is very good specially for children they can download all the games they want to download on it...
1,This Fire TV works great. I would recommend having Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. Also if you know anything about KODI you should DEFINITELY add that.
1,first tablet for my goddaughters they love it easy to use easy setup
1,"After purchasing a smart tv looking forward to using the built in apps I discovered that the ones offered weren't up to par. I went back and talked to a very knowledgeable associate, Heather, she showed me why i was having trouble with the streaming on my new tv and suggested getting a streaming device. After listening to her explain the differences between them I decided on the Amazon Fire TV and she was spot on. No more issues and the speed and picture are great. Thanks so much Heather."
1,Love my foxfire box. Easy to setup and works well!
0,"Priced for the modest budget, but is totally capable of performance to satisfy the basic needs of entry level tablet users."
1,"Ok, my wife wanted this thing... I thought it was just another fad, Siri without the Apple... I was very wrong. The sound is amazing, streaming music as an amazing prime member is easy and the song selection spectacular. There are so many things it can do, and i have read home security will be linked in soon... worth the price."
1,"I already have Apple TV, but bought the Fire TV, since it's so highly rated, for another room. So glad I did, because it's worked out GREAT for less money than the Apple TV."
1,"I was severely disappointed that the tablet has only 5.63 G when the packaging said it had 8 G. It was purchased because of the promised 8. It functions well, otherwise."
1,"Bought a Vizio tv with the new google cast and cannot stand it. So I decided to go with the fire tv from Amazon and works great. The 4K streaming is amazing. Only problem is you have to subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime etc but who doesn't have an account with them these days?"
1,Out at the farm we set up a ClearStream 4 antenna and got about twice as many channels that we wanted to watch (total about 50). We needed an interface for streaming and this works great. In addition it gives us a remote control for our Tablo to record the shows with no subscriptions needed. Total cord cutting!
1,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire Tablets for my god-children for Christmas and they love them. The tablets go where ever they go! They play games on them, as well as play educational games to learn different skills needed for school.I love that Amazon made the Fire tablet kids proof and the screen isn't so fragile."
1,Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
1,Great for my 6 year old son he loves it was an easy set up. and for my son being 6 he knows how to work it very well. great from kids.
1,Great product. Would recommend it to others to buy.
1,Nice case I love the blue and the magnetic cover it stays on nicely protects the screen and had me a useful standing feature
1,"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
1,"What a great product. Fun, helpful and great sound for a speaker. I highly recommend!"
1,"Since I wasn't familiar with tablets, I had a little trouble navigating it, but the help section was a BIG help to me, as well as your staff. The tablet is doing exacting what I wanted and needed it for. I like the case that I bought to go with it."
1,Great for kids. Easy to use. Great games to download.
1,My daughter plays on her tablet all the time. Well worth it.
1,"For reading, games, facebook, twitter, minor surfing the internet, this is a great device. It is small, but not so small as to be difficult to read. Fairly quick and dependable. For the price, it is hard to beat."
1,"Christmas gift for my son, he really likes it & easy to operate!"
1,I wish I would have purchased the Fire before I bought my iPad mini. I would have saved over $200!
1,My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.
1,I love it my son will enjoy it because it keeps him quiet
1,"I have a lot of things in my home automated and we use Alexa as a part of that. I'd wanted a portable Alexa to use in our deck area and first look at a Tap late 2016. I ruled it out because the user had to touch it to enable Alexa which isn't convenient. I purchased a Dot battery pack and it worked okay but once I dropped and broke it, I needed a new solution. I knew that Amazon had added voice activation so I bought a Tap. It is great. Sound quality is good enough for me and it is a semi-rugged Alexa device we can port around outside."
0,The screen was small for me and I couldn't access a website with free ebooks. I ended up taking it back and read on my iPad now.
1,The Kindle is a great reader. This works even in full sunlight.
1,This was a Christmas Present for my niece. It was perfect. Immediately became her favorite and gave her parents devices a break. Would definitely recommend.
1,there was so much to choose from on black Friday that I wished I had enough money to buy everything. nice tablets amazing deal.
1,"My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,."
1,Fast and easy to use. I watch Prime movies on it and also play games on it also. Best part you can add apps to it.
1,I'm very happy with this purchase. It is perfect for a child or an adult that does not need too much storage on their tablet.
1,Bought this for my grand-daughter as a replacement for her Toshiba pad--same size and features. Seems to work as well or better. Small cost and Best Buy has inexpensive add'l warranty.
1,Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
1,"This has to be one of the best technology purchases I have made. Honestly, I was simply looking for a good quality Bluetooth speaker when I found the Echo.It was around the same price range as the speakers I already had under consideration, but Echo does so much more. I purchased the Lifx lights for my home (wifi connectivity) and control them via Echo. ""Alexa turn on the bathroom light"" or ""Alexa change hall light to blue"" I love it. The sound quality for music is fantastic and the Amazon music library is packed full of all of my favorite songs.I also use echo to check the location of my packages, get news and weather updates every morning while I get ready for work and keep an easy to use shopping list. Seriously love this thing."
1,"I had the dot, but it wasnt loud enough. Ive used my sisters and fell in love with this one. She has the black one, so I got the white one & I love it. It blends in and works great."
1,If I purchased it at the sale price -- $25 cheaper -- I'd be giving it 5*. Amazon has a few kinks -- please focus on services I have setup -- but on the whole it's easy to find content.
1,Easy to use and set up. It is the best tablet for reading books or listening to audiobooks.
1,I was hesitant since I also have a smart phone but it's well worth it. Love that it doesn't smudge or break as easily and is easy on my eyes even in the dark. Love the kindle share program
1,"Got two of these for the grandkids, they just love them. We also have a Kindle Fire. We use these for reading, playing games, etc."
1,I love my new Kindle!! I would recommend this to everyone!! It has so many features and love the size!!
1,Bought a new Fire tablet for my wife for a Mother's Day gift to replace an old tablet. She is fully enjoying the new device and fashionable case. Best Buy staff were very helpful too.
1,"This Kindle makes reading even more enjoyable. Very light in the hand, amazing back light. Very highly recommended."
1,Right out of the box Alexa performance is outstanding and so easy to setup. 5stars
1,"Purchased this for my older son to be able to Skype with me over long distance. It is a great tablet and functions well for movies, games, and Skype."
0,The portability is nice but misses key elements from the other two.Sound is good but this unit does not allow for the new peak in feature or allow you to add this speaker to play music all thru the house .
1,"Works great, easy to use. Battery holds charge good. Just the right size."
1,purchased this item for my 7 year grandson he loves it
1,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
1,great item and at a great price. love using it daily.
1,this device is awesome. all reviews and produt demo is correct.
1,"Product was a bit difficult to set up but my tech savvy daughter assisted. Once it was set up, it worked perfectly. Love the programming only no local channels."
1,"The one I have been using, generic, is so bad. You have to mess with it to get it to work. I really love this one . Small and plugs in nice and tight."
1,This Echo is amazing!! I love waking up and not having to use a remote or get out of bed.. she does a lot.. and the names are perfect Alexa or Amazon.. but it's a great speaker loud..
1,Easy to use and understand. It's a great purchase.
1,We can't wait to start using them. This item is a definite must BUY!!!!
1,"I purchased the kindle Fire for my Uncle. He has really enjoyed this product. Easy to operate, variety of games and books. Also, this model has a camera!"
1,I can say that amazon fire tv is a great product for people who enjoy watching their favorite shows in a easy way with out too much work...don't think about it too much just buy it :)
1,We are very happy with this tablet. It is much better then the RCA
1,This is a great streaming device so many options. I love Amazon Fire tv.
0,"We bought this for the son of a family friend. From what we can tell they like it. Not the highest resolution screen and you have to be tied to Amazon services to really enjoy it, but it's definitely a nice functioning tablet."
1,Very easy to set up.. Excellent remote and fantastic quality picture
1,I started with the fire stick and then upgraded to the fire Tv it has a much faster processor and runs add ons better. great for your home TV set
1,Great quality great movies the Amazon Fire Stick in the Amazon box is the best thing I ever had
1,"It was easy to hook up, and it is easy to use, the directions are complete. Would recommend to anyone wanting to supplement their cable or dish services."
1,Great item. You get so much from such a small box. It's definitely worth the money.
0,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
1,"It's so nice being able to listen to whatever we want to listen to! She tells some pretty corny jokes, too!"
1,I love my Echo!!! I think you should buy one too!!!
1,"This is a nice, cheap little tablet. It's simple but for the price I don't have too many complaintsSome things I've noticed though is that the battery life is very short and appears to drain battery even when not in use. I find it difficult to cut and paste text and I'm not sure how or if you can save pics to the gallery. This tablet is best for streaming media and simple browsing."
0,"After about two weeks I ended up returning this item. It constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stick.The voice search was a joke. I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem, I love my Echo, but I was disappointed with this device. And for a hundred dollars? No thanks."
1,"The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids."
1,It's amazing product. I love it. Amazon always provide amazing product and good price.
1,"Simple device, quick start up, but because of the UI it makes it a little hard to navigate."
0,"Device does not stay connected to wifi, always disconnecting. This makes product unusable for alarms and timers. When used to work with harmony, at times, does not turn on all devices. Over priced and overrated. Purchased Google Home, for the past week, it has not lost contact with wifi, and works perfectly with harmony hub. Difficult setup with echo, even with 5-6 times with echo support, they can't figure it out. Wish I could return, not too late."
1,Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.
1,"I waited too long to get the Amazon Echo. It's a perfect complement to my Sonos system and we got one for the kitchen n and another for the master bath. Connects to siriusXM and Pandora, reads me the news in the morning and frankly it's fun to have around!"
1,I bought this tablet for my wife. The Google app store and 8 gigs of memory were just what she was looking for.
1,best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
1,Good price for great product. Used reward points to help purchase. Very knowledgable sales person who could compare products
1,The Fire is a good handy tablet. So far I have not been able to download a document from something other than Amazon. The document I am trying to download is the reason I bought Fire in the first place.
0,it is not free everything . have to pay and had return it to best buy store . wish free everything without cents . sorry
1,"Alexa is like Siri for home. I love it! I play songs cleaning the house or play different genres for get togethers. She plays corny jokes that are funny, too. Anything you ask she pretty much knows. I recommend definitely."
0,"Good price, functions well, nice screen to read books"
1,"will begin by saying, I truly enjoy Amazon's products. I rarely go anywhere without my Kindle Paperwhite, and while I don't use it too much, I love the functionality and convenience of the Kindle Fire. While there are other tablets that probably do more, the Fire does exactly what I want and need it to do, and for that I am very happy."
1,"I love everything about this reader. The book advertising on the lock screen is so cool in my house, its such a small thing but it makes us smile every time. I do think its kinda weird that it flickers sometimes but after watching product videos I see that its not abnormal. Maybe if I looked it up I'd understand but its not bothersome enough to do so. Overall I would buy this item again no questions asked."
1,This is a great beginner tablet for children. Bumper pad fantastic for protection from falls.
1,"If you want to read books in an electronic form you can't beat the paperwhite. You can read it wearing sunglasses, in the brightest sunshine, or the darkest room. Tablets may be more versatile, but they are not as easy to read in various lighting conditions."
1,My grand children love kids tablets and play with them every day and their mother is using them to teach the kids
1,I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.
1,Fire tabs always work great! I will always recommend it
1,This thing is fast which is what I like about it. All my older network video streamers seem to get slower (interface)
1,"This thing is awesome. Good volume, blends in with the room and is easy to setup."
1,"Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster. Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by 100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot."
1,"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle."
1,Works great if all you want to do is read and not be distracted by internet.
1,"This thing is great, I still haven't gotten any smart home devices yet, but everything else is so convenient! Shopping and to-do lists, traffic, weather. I was even shown how to create a Skill so Alexa now will use Google Search for answers!"
1,Still learning about my Echo but so far just love it!
1,I purchased 2 to give to my daughters for Christmas. They really enjoy them. They were easy to set up and they are easy to read on.
1,I bought the Amazon Fire TV to mod and stream media. It works fantastic and does exactly what I want including 4k video output. The primary reason I chose this item over the Fire stick was that I wanted wired ethernet and not wireless. Picture quality and sound is excellent.
1,Very functional for my needs. Quick and easy to set up. I love my new Kindle Fire!!!
1,This is one of the best purchases I have ever made pay the little extra and get the fire tv
1,This tablet is just what the kids needed. It's easy to use.
1,This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.
1,Delivery great handling and use for those wanting a natural reading device instead of the glitter of some technologies
1,"Echo is not just fun but useful to a small degree. It's fun with apps like Jeopardy and jokes. Somewhat useful is the flash briefings with news and finding out the weather and the traffic for the drive to work. Somewhat more useful, but still really just fun, are the lights you can buy and turn on and off by voice. The most practical for me is the ability to add to the shopping list by multiple family members which then goes to the Alexa app that everyone has which they can check while out shopping. It's not Star Trek quality, but I'm still glad I got it."
1,Love the Amazon Echo! Easy setup and receives voice commands well. Music is crisp and verbal information is very understandable.
1,I got this for 35 dollars as part of Thanksgiving promotion. Its normal price is 50. Its a good starting level tab for basic purpose. Its not as smooth as IPAD or Galaxy note but its ok for basic browsing. I specifically got this for my 3 year old to watch Youtube and play some light games and it works perfect. I am not much used to android so I found it a bit tricky to use. It also has a slot for microSD card so that solves your memory issues.
1,"The Amazon Fire TV is a great streaming box. I also have the Amazon Fire TV Stick which is just as good. The reason I gave the Fire TV only 4-stars is because I see no reason to even have the Fire TV as the Fire TV Stick is just as good if not better, considering its size, than the box. Sure with the box you get better performing specs out of it but what for? In my performance reviews, the Fire TV Stick performed on par with the Fire TV box. The choice is up to you as they are both great streaming devices. However, save yourself some money and go with the Fire TV Stick!"
1,I bought this for my grandson and it hasn't disappointed me at all! He loves his tablet! I am looking at buying his sister one next!
1,Bought this for the daughter with an eyesight/ learning disability. Loved it as I could change the size of text and the color of the background.
1,I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use
1,I bought this for my grandkids. It is easy to use and they Love it.
1,"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
1,the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
1,"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
1,Love how it just makes our day even simpler. It's like Google for the home. Best addition of the year. I highly recommend.
1,Love my Kindle Paperwhite. Love that you can read it outdoors.
0,Ok tablet...decent size screen & graphics. Was hoping I could mirror my phone to it but it doesn't have miracast.
1,I have had an Echo for over a year and bought two for my son's. In my experience it is a joy to use. The voice recognition tech is astounding. It is really easy to use.
1,We purchased this item because our Smart TV has slowed down (Its a few years old) and we were tired of having to use our game consoles and/or phones to stream content. This solved our problem. The Fire TV is very fast and has tons of content.
1,The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
1,Only small issue was setting up to start with. My kid took care of that.
1,It's good for the low cost. Good one to gift. Does the basic job..
1,The Kindle is everything I expected it to be and fits all the needs that I had of this item
1,Would purchase again. Great product. It is easy to install. You tube was very helpful to me with the installation of my Amazon Fire stick.
1,"Works exactly what I wanted it for. Camera isn't great, but I had no intention of using it anyway"
1,Bought to use Sling. It works decent. Glitches sometimes but overall worth it.
1,Thanks Bestbuy for offering best price!!! We have been looking for this product since long and finally got it at bestbuy in great price.
1,Have had it awhile and still learning and adding to it's skills but so far it's pretty good. I'll be adding the additional home automation features soon so we'll see how that goes.
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
1,My niece and nephew are going to love this! I got it for a great price too. What a nice Christmas present
1,We bought this to replace a Roku 3 that had died. This is an excellent streaming device! It has roughly the same specs as a Roku 4 but is much less expensive. I definitely recommend this!
1,As good if not better than many other more expensive tablets
1,Wanted to have something larger than my cell phone and smaller than my laptop for internet access! Faster than either one of them!
1,I had purchased one years ago for my mother. This was a replacement to the kindle. The fire some different features. But keeps my mother busy with mind games and sure help on that long trip to Italy.
1,I love this product. I only with she would understand me a litle better.
1,I love my kindle. Silk is a fast and easy way to access the webI can read books on my kindle anywhere once I download them to my kindle. I have over 300 books on the Cloud. It holds a charge for days when idle. Downside. Hard to read outside due to glare
1,We tried the roku 3 and by far the fire box is way better in our opinion.
1,"Great tool for streaming, HD is awesome and sound is to, only wish it had ability to stream from USB stick or external HDD."
1,"Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games."
1,Easy to use and teach my granddaughter not easily breakable
1,I love how you can play games on it and have all of your account all-in-one!!!
1,It was easy to install. Provides amusement and entertainment every day.
1,"The Kindle was as a replacement for an earlier model. Its performance and ease of use are superb However, the battery life is far shorter than my older version. It wouldn't last from LA to Frankfort and the old one did."
1,"It helps me keep my schedule, and Perfect to listen to music."
1,Bought it for my husband's birthday so he could read books and download music. He loves it and for the price it was well worth it!
1,Nice and convenient tablet for kids! I like that it has parental control so parents can Connell what the kids do and download on it. Only downfall is you can't get all apps on these
1,I bought 2 of these for my kids when we go on trips to play educational games and movies. For the price they are nice to have! I have had no complaints with any of the Kindle Products that I have purchased.
1,The Amazon Echo is great for finding your favorite entertainment and a good source for practical information. Great gift to give or receive!
1,"I'd suggest 8-12 is a good age for this tablet, it's a great starter tablet until your young one shows responsibility, care and proper use of electronics."
1,"I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music."
1,Kindles are great as long as your not expecting a tablet that's top of the line. So far no problems.
1,Grandson was so happy & pleased with the Fire tablet. He was able to download & start playing within minutes of purchase. Would buy another if the need existed.
1,Good product the only 2 drawbacks that I find are 1. Could have been more interactive with a continuous conversation. 2. Music should work without Amazon Music.
1,Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
1,Charger broke. Just what I needed to replace my broken charger
1,"I updated my kindle touch to this. I loved the price. I got it a few months ago for $50, which is still an affordable price for a kindle. I love the Bluetooth and text to speech features coupled with the fact that it has an expandable drive. Those features along with the price were what I needed. Oh did I mention the resolution for watching movies is good. The camera is not the best, but I didn't get this for the camera. Matter of fact I got one on Black Friday as a Christmas gift for a friend."
1,Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.
1,She love it. She said it easy to use.She love it very much
1,Features are as described. Looks nice and a great item for executive gifts.
0,"Its light weight, i do not care for the amazon app store..Android is so much better..I cannot get all the app I need from amazon..the amazon Kindle is a nice size and light weight.."
1,This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
1,I love this tablet I take it everywhere with me. It's small enough to take with you on trips.
1,I am loving all the things Alexa can do. I am not a techie and it was easy to get up and going.
1,This is a great item for use is household and kids
1,"I mainly purchased this tablet for my toddler. I didn't want to spend too much on a tablet since she only likes her one baby app. It works well, good image and sound. Can't beat the price!"
1,I bought this as a present for my wife. She loves to read. Since she got it a month ago she has finished 3 books. Great product! My wife loves having access to books immediately!
1,We are able to watch lots of different programming
0,"Clunky and full of ads. Ok for my kids to use for games, but I wouldn't use this for myself."
0,The Amazon Fire is an okay product with a decent OS and a great price. Reccommend it for kids or the elderly.
1,I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.
1,You cant go wrong with this for either your kids or a adult.
1,"Enjoy the features offered and its ability to integrate with other devices. Will be an integral driver in the success of the ""smart home"". Took a star away because of the sound. Solid overall but not pure quality."
1,Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!
1,"really slow but for 25 dollars who am i to complaint, i just use it for books and my kids for games."
1,"This is my second kindle for the price wasn't bad, however had to exchange it for another one right after was purchased. The screen would not come on."
1,"Great product, great service and best item I have purchased in years."
1,"Great stocking stuffer , we love giving this little number as gifts every year"
1,My son enjoys this tablet as it is kids friendly and easy to use
0,"Tablet was brought for my fiance for Christmas. I had to return it because it kept freezing up. Also, it didnt get Clash of the Clans game.."
1,Great speaker. Pretty loud. I like it that controls my hue ligths
1,"This tablet is really great for someone who wants a standard tablet experience. Nothing too flashy, but more than gets the job done."
1,This tablet is great and my 4 year old son can run it easily. I had to reset it when I first recieved it bit after that worked great. He plays lots of games and uses the audio books. The battery life is good as well and charges fast
1,This is a very nice tablet for my younger daughter and especially the price!!
1,This device has exceeded my expectations so far I love it
1,If you want an easy way to read a book or check out social media then this item at around $50 is a steal!
1,gave my dad my kindle two years ago and at xmas time i loved the price and upgrades of camara and sd card
0,"7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge."
0,Has lots of ads and seems to be a little slow in response. Bought for my kids and they like it so I'm ok with it.
1,I love this tablet. This is the third one I have given out because I liked mine so much. the price is just right and value is out of sight
1,Brought this Tablet for a child and she loves it very much
1,Great for the price. Easy to navigate. Kids love the games I put on it.
1,"I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!"
1,This charger and adapter works just fine with the E-reader. I was so glad that I purchased it as the E-reader does not come with one.
1,"I have five iPads and they work well but they cost hundreds more then the Fire. The Fire is fast ,very good battery life, the screen is great and is very easy to learn. It is not a iPad but I use it more than I use my iPad. Small ,easy to hold and read. I can't say anything bad about it. Works very well and I like it very much. Also I bought three more of them for my grandkids to play with and they like there's also, PS they also have iPads but use the fire more."
1,Alexa has very good voice recognition. It has new tools added every day
1,My second Kindle. I've also owned a Nook. Both are good but the Kindles screen is a little better. I also like the case available for it much better than the Nook's.
1,"Since buying this, we listen to music on it, get information from it. We love it - it has a great sound to it. We would definitely recommend it."
1,Sound is great and the voice recognition is amazing. Love it.
1,Got the tablet while it was on sale. Great choice.
1,I like the bigger screen size. It allows me to read my books without straining my eyes and allows more of the text to be displayed.
1,Bought a couple of these for gifts. Great for all ages. My 60 year old aunt loves it as does my 12 year old nephew.
1,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
1,The Amazon Echo has amazing voice recognition tech.
1,The paper white is easy to hold and simple to use. Downloading books is very fast. The screen is easy on the eyes and makes reading a book enjoyable.
1,I love my Fire TV Box!! I use it almost everyday!!
1,I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
1,"This is so easy to read no matter where you are...beach, train or airplane!"
0,"It works great. Not affected by the singular WiFi band at all.Battery life is amazing.Just be sure you can get the apps you'd like from the appstore, google play isn't accessible. So if you're looking for Snapchat, Instagram, NBC, Comcast, Vudu, you won't get those here.Returning it. Which is too bad, I really enjoyed it. More bang for the buck if you could access those apps. But like I said, it was my fault for not checking first. I was expecting the 'apps from unknown sources' to kick in but it so didn't."
1,"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"
1,"Great tablet for the price, however the ad upon the lock screen is irritating."
1,This media streamer is good. I like the voice feature.
1,"Got Alexa set up to control my lights and tv, along with being linked to my spotify but I am excited to continue finding out what else she can be used for!"
1,The amazon fire hd is really nice. Does everything I need it to
1,Works good... Not sure if prime makes getting free books better or not but she gets a lot of em!
1,"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
1,My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
1,bought this as a gift for my mom send she loves it
1,"This tablet is the perfect solution for my needs. I could easily have spent much more money for features and capabilities that I don't need. Price, size and functions are just right."
1,my granddaughter has learned a lot of educational things on hers
1,"Great, light, simple to use, worth the money, battery lasts for long time"
0,"Set up was easy and load times and picture quality is amazing. The only set back is you have to purchase pretty much anything. I understand buying a movies , but to have to buy tv episodes is a draw back. I could just stick with my direct tv for that"
0,We actually bought this for my son as a replacement tablet. He likes it but does not like the fact that not every game that is available in the google play store is available on this one. Overall it is a great tablet. Works quickly and he enjoys it.
1,"Its small , compact, convenient to put into purse."
1,"Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use."
1,I purchased two for my grandchildren. They carry the Kindle with them everywhere they go. Great purchase!
1,I love the echo but you need one in every room to control things from everywhere in a big house. The speaker accessory to put in other rooms is only available through Amazon and is still on back order.
1,Liked this because it had the functionality of an IPad without the high price tag.
1,Love this unit! Helps me stay ahead of the game. Everyone should own one.
1,was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
1,"easy to use and works well, benefits of amazon plan great"
1,"More trendy than helpful, but I use it to control Wemo light."
1,works perfect
1,I love it you can ask it anything and it will answer you you can keep up with your football team he can play the music that you like and music you've never heard so you can figure out if you do like it I found out today if hummingbirds migrate you can ask it some very interesting questions.
1,If everything continues to hold up then I will be a repeat buyer!
1,"Place Amazon orders.. use reminders, timers, music.. love it!"
1,"I was looking for a larger tablet than my 7"" Kindle Fire and was on the fence that the 10"" Kindle Fire would be too large. Much to my surprise, it has been an easy adjustment. While larger, the video viewing is better and the magazine reading is much easier on the eyes. Although I miss my 7"" for my book reading as the 10"" seems too big, I am happy overall with the new tablet."
1,"I asked my husband for this for Mother's Day. He didn't think it would be worth the price but he bought it for me anyway. We both love the device. It is convenient for checking the weather, setting a timer, listening to music, etc. I plan on buying another. I love this product."
1,"I bought this echo when it was first released and I just couldn't swallow the cost. It's a cool speaker that allowed hands free operation but $100 was just too much money. Since then, the discounts have been much more meager but it's become so useful. I've smartened up my home and controlling my lights, entertainment system and security system has been amazing."
0,"Purchased for viewing Amazon prime. Loaded a couple apps and set it to sleep. When I returned a few hours later it was stuck in a perpetual boot and was not recoverable. I will get another as I like the features and price point, just a little soured by this first impression. I'm checking that I would not recommend to a friend but am hoping this will change with the second one. to be continued..."
1,This is undoubtedly the best Christmas present this year.
1,"Get your weather forecast first thing in the morning, review your to do list, check your appointments for the day all while having your morning coffee. Great way to start your day."
1,"We enjoy this new addition to our home. It's fun, entertaining, and the speaker is great."
1,"Awesome product and endless the things it can do, simplifies so many things"
1,Gave one each to my parents and they liked the gifts a lot.
1,"Good tablet for the price. Good for reading books, and most apps."
1,"I bought my Echo to explore some new technology. When I walk in my house after getting off work I ask Alexa to play some music from my play list and there it goes. Alexa keeps me up to date on the weather, Emails me recipes, plays triva games and so much more."
1,Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet.
1,"A tablet with front/rear facing camera, bluetooth, external storage option, for just $50 is a great deal in my opinion. I use this tablet to play baby rhymes for my 18 month old son, in the car."
1,"Works good and great price, great for books or music on the go"
1,The kids really enjoy this tablet. This tablet is built well
1,"The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
1,Music plays loud that I can hear it in my other bedroom on Max 10 volume!
1,Best gadget to gift someone. They would just love it.
1,Grandson picked it up & used it right away. He enjoys the tablet.
1,"The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it)."
1,Happy with this item. Able to use it with ease. Would recommend this item to others. Easy to download things too.
1,"Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well"
1,Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
1,I also bought my one for my 15yr. old and my 14yr. old child. My 4yr. old loves it and he can play it with no problem. I think it far most the best tablet you can get for under $50. I would recommend it.
1,"Great product, it streams fast and is a good replacement from high cable bill"
1,Amazing what Echo can do. Look forward do more with the updates that come out.
0,"I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy."
1,"I've owned an Apple TV, Chromecast, and now this. This is my favorite of the 3 because of the highest quality of streaming. The one downside is that it is not compatible with my echo dot."
1,I bought this to replace my satellite but have not done it yet. It is laggy at times and has connection issues. The remote looses connection often and doesn't connect back until batteries are removed. A bit hard to navigate with the remote. It works well if all you want is to get Kodi but it is kind off difficult for a newbie. With prime subscription it is great.
1,Love having easy access to my amazon prime account. Easy setup!
1,Works well for my Kindle.
1,It works great and fun great to use can't wait to buy some acceries going to get prime
1,"Purchased this item for a friend, ended up keeping this for my home. Love all the things you can do with this from music to cutting on the lights or other items. Love this!!!"
1,Steady learning new things daily on my new Kindle.
1,This is a easy friendly e-book for everyone in your family
1,had the fire hd 7inch reader.. love the new tablet can do so much more and great value for a tablet
1,"So far I am happy with the Amazon echo. I haven't used it to its full potential yet, but it's very convenient!"
1,"Nice to review photos on mini sd card but, disappointed that photos can't be downloaded to the hard drive. Better camera with ability to see what you are taking pictures rather than 3rd generation which only has only one camera lens."
0,"Not a lot of memory, dies fast. Great games........"
1,"I purchase for test because cost less than $50, work awesome, faster, easy to use and good product by the price."
1,Alexa is helpful and of course the Bluetooth feature is great
1,Good for reading in low light situations. It is also very easy to hold due to its size.
1,Kindle paperwhite is wonderful. I am able to read in the sun.
1,"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
1,"I use a Kindle Paper White for all my reading. 2 hours plus a day. But I am always disappointed when it comes to looking at maps, pictures and diagrams. Although the battery life is much shorter than the reader and the screen is not glare free, the picture is great for these old eyes!"
1,Just as advertised. Answers to questions only take a couple of seconds. Great thorough information is returned by Alexa! Looking to buy some echo Dots in the very near future!
1,Love this!!!!It is kidproof...I have a active 1 year old grandson who enjoy it very much!!!
1,"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
1,"This is our first Kindle, we are learning how to operate it, so far it has been quite easy and enjoyable to use"
0,"This tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the Kids tablets or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go. The video on Amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video, Amazon ""One touch"" is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you don't mind a lot of $2.99 purchases. In short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake. I thought I was on Prime video and notice that I was charged for an episode of Warehouse 13. Since I didn't see the show and caught this quickly I was able to chat with Amazon Customer Care and they walked me through how to change that setting online. This tablet not for me since I'm looking for a higher end media tablet with more memory than the 8GB this unit has."
1,Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
1,This is a neat home automation item. Looking forward to more integration with other home automation brand products.
1,I like how cheap this is. It's great for browsing the Internet.
0,It's slippery u cannot hold it it always slips and lots of ads definitely not good if u don't like advertising
1,Great for my kid. She takes it on all our road trip.
1,I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.
1,No prob loved it highly recommend. Easy to transport. Great graphics.
1,"Works great indoors & out. Very light weight & easy to carry, even in a pocket. Amazon downloads are easy & quick."
1,Love that the memory is expandable! The kids are going to love it.
0,For the price the tablet works well. The biggest issue I've had is the battery life length. The battery seems to not last as long as my previous iPad mini.
1,Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
1,My husband loves how simple it is to use and he can take it anywhere
0,"Bought this as a gift for my niece but I use it every now and then. She loves it, gives her ebook, music, videos, games etc... All in one through Amazon without having to get any external apps, most already built in. I like it as well except not so much the platform and navigating around it."
1,I love my Kindle eReader Paperwhite. I finally had to charge it almost 4 weeks after I got it and first charged. I love how long the battery lasts. I have no problem seeing screen and reading when outside in the sun. Only thing I wish it also had was an option to listen to audio on it if I wanted to. The size of the Paperwhite is perfect and the weight is minimal.
1,Gets the job done. Lots of free apps available. I would buy a second one.
1,I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.
1,"Great product, I would recommend this device to everyone looking stream"
1,This is much faster then the firestick.will work with amazon echo. Voice remote works great!!
1,Great tablet for the price. I already have 3 followers including the hd.
1,I decided to purchase this tablet because my 2 year old son refused to play with his leap frog tablet. He's happy with it and takes it everywhere with him including daycare. Great price!!!!
1,Value to the Product.Useful if you have amazon prime account and it is a good value for the money spent.I bought it for my kid. My kid like it.
1,"Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen."
1,"My daughter loves playing with Alexa, from math problems to telling jokes and inter acting with most of the comments you may have. Alexa is still kind of limited to trivia compared to google home but demonstrates and excellent integration with your smarthome devices. The design also blended in in my kitchen very well and i have replaced my old bluetooth speaker with it. So much potential with this device."
1,Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
1,Love it but ended up returning for the HD8. Would recommend it to anyone.
1,"This isn't a great tablet. Obviously. It's not even a pretty good tablet. What it is, is a really solid tablet that, at $35, is basically disposable. I take this thing places where it might get stolen or broken, because if it does... I'm only out $35. Consequently I use it a lot more because it's not so precious. Also, the ability to download movies from Prime and watch them off line, makes this guy the perfect subway tablet."
1,Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!
1,I purchased this tablet to read books online and I love it the screen is nice.
1,I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.
1,Does what I need!
1,I am so glad I purchased the Paperwhite. It makes reading better at night because of little glare and dimmer than my Fire or Ipad. Was finding it hard to justify buying it but I'm really glad I did!
1,"Got this tablet for a 6-year old. It has all the bells & whistles of the more expensive Kindles, but I don't get upset if it gets lost or broken."
1,"Was expecting the moon but very happy with what it actually is. Limits are being pushed by active development, so it's a new experience every week or so. Nice interaction with home automation. Amazon prime is not bad either..."
0,"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!"
1,"Love the echo, worth the price. Very entertaining and good for quick assistance."
1,I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.
1,bought for my boyfriend because he cant see to much on his phone. he loves it.
1,It's a little slow on some things but otherwise I really like the tablet.
1,The Kindle Fire 7 is a phenomenal item I bought for child 2 years ago now and she can't put it down. Great alternative to Ipad
0,Honestly I see no difference in this and the iPhone.
1,Had a great experience with the product it has been fast and works great. I have enjoyed this product.I would recommend this product to any one. The price was even great price for our budget.Thank you for making it easy.
1,The Amazon Echo worked so well I purchased 3 Dots. Very good speech recognition and text to voice. The more I learn the more I like it.
0,Don't like all the ads. Didn't know that they would be permanent because I bought it on sale. It's very slow and has trouble connecting to my wifi.
1,"Bought it for kids to play with and not have to worry about kids breaking it since the price is okay. Also use it as a mean to do video chat. OK video quality, not too bad."
1,I cut off my cable and went for the streaming box finally .. have been happy with my purchase. no regrets
1,This stick runs fast and smooth with alot less lag than the original. If you want to the best the Nvidia shield 2017 is the best.
1,I love the kindle. we purchased 3 of them. they are great for the little things that you don't want to pull your laptop out for and good for the bigger things that you need to view on something bigger than your phone. The apps are good and games are fun.
1,You can find thousands of movies and your favorite shows
1,I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.
1,After enabling things you can ask it to do something love playing music
1,"My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use."
1,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!"
1,Alexa is great for listening to music. Sound quality is excellent.
1,Best electronic purchase in a long time serves its perpose for streaming my shows and watching movies!
1,I have a smart TV but the Fire TV is faster and extremely more flexible. It is the best value of all units I reviewed. I have highly recommend the Fire TV and Fire Stick to my friends. They too have purchased and love it.
1,it works perfectly...4k for 4k tivi and amazon prime
1,I had used the Kindle Paperwhite for quite awhile before I got intrigued by the Voyage seeing it in person. I was apprehensive about upgrading given the higher cost but it was entirely worth it. The Paperwhite is lite in weight but somehow the Voyage feels weightless. The screen is absolutely beautiful and to me the nicest feature is the screen is flush with the bezel around. Little learning curve to the page press on the side but tweaking the settings a little I have it down now.
0,Over Priced due to the cost of Kindle at 289.00. Should come with Kindle.
1,If you've an Amazon prime account this is a must have. Lots of free shows and movies to watch and lots of apps to download. Also a great way to have tv in another room without the need for another cable or satellite box because it runs off your wifi. Very small so it helps in keeping a nice clean entertaining alternative.
1,Purchase this tablet for my niece and I must say it's a best product in this range.
1,I bought this because my iPad 4th gen gave up on me and it a waste of money to buy a new one so I got this amazon kindle fire for $34.99. Its a good deal for a replacement so I don't have to use my phone to check my emails...
0,"I, as well as other Kindle lovers, have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover, it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable. Within 3 months, and I only started using the Kindle with the cover in the past 2 weeks, noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather. No idea what would cause this, I have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage, not sunlight, heat, moisture or anything. I will be requesting a replacement, but Kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product, especially for the price we paid."
1,"I somehow feel like the Google Home would be more intuitive than Alexa. You ask her a question and her answer is "" I don't understand the question"" she says that more often than answer a question. Her hearing speaker is also not that great, needs to be improved upon. Great concept when linked with Harmony Hub Elite, can control more of your media devices like, TV, Receiver, Projector, game consoles., cable box but can't do any of these with out the hubs linked to it. If you purchase the smart devices such as the Lutron Caseta lighting controls, Nest Thermostat she can control your lighting too. I gave her a four because she can do all that once programmed correctly which can be a tedious process but once done she seems to work just fine. Just needs a few improvements, Amazon."
1,Kindle paperwhite is very good for reading. I have bought 4. I think it very good both for personal use and gift.
1,"Bought our fire on black Friday for $35, and bought a 64gb SD card for it for $15. Now we have a 72GB kindle fire for $50. You cant beat that. We haven't had any issues with it at all."
1,"I picked this up Oma deal of the day. Took a little learning, but man is this thing great for travel! Does backlight reading and plays my digital movies. Great all around tablet!"
1,I watch everything on this now From movies to Sports and ur everyday news
1,"I bought two Amazon - Fire - 7"" Tablet - 8GB on sale for $39.99 (Reg. $49.99), at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only spent $30.00, saved $20.00 for one tablet and another one 2 months later with another coupon for even less for my elderly mother. Both 7"" tablets exceeded my expectations and then some. I downloaded all my apps for my Amazon account and Google Play Store. Setting Kodi was as easy as Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, just download the apps. I love this tablet, it works very well. I bought it because I love to check my e-mails etc. Having a 7"" screen makes it all easy and simple. As far as apps go, it has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and tumblr available. It does not have Instagram available at the Amazon Store, but it does have it at Google Play Store. This Amazon Fire 7"" tablet is so lightweight, and you will love it too. As far as technology, it's an awesome tablet for the price, it's one of the nicest size tablets you can get your hands on. It's perfect for a child or an elderly person, to enjoy anywhere. I would highly recommend this tablet."
1,"It is a great decent device to have around, super fast streaming without getting over heated."
0,"Purchased this & turned around & within minutes of the purchase & before even leaving the store, found out that it would not do what my granddaughter needed. Unfortunately the clerk in electronics had told us it would & found out at the register by that person after she rang it up, that it would not. Need a little more education, I think..."
1,Just what you'd expect. Construction is solid. The interface is intuitive. Screen is very readable and the unit fits well in the hand and is comfortable to hold for a long time when you get hooked on a great read.
1,For the price it is a great tablet. Not as good as an android but still good
1,"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
1,"I am very satisfied with this new Kindle. I had gotten another brand, but had to return it because of problems getting books from a library. After talking to my library on how to download books with this Kindle, It was a breeze. The only thing about getting books from the library, Amazon will not let some library books be downloaded. All in all, I really like this product.."
1,The echo is very fun and easy to use. My only complaint is that you need to go and enable a lot of the prompts or skills. Seems to me it should be able to go right out the box. But overall lot's of fun.
1,"Easy to use, battery life could be better, but does what's needed"
1,"Great size, easy to use, long-lasting battery, great for the beach and pool side with the anti glare screen. Even able to read at night with the adjustable backlighting."
1,Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
1,"Runs kodi extremely well, the on board apps and services are great too. Really a top of the line media box. Can't utilize 4k yet but some day!!"
1,Backup tablet not a lot of apps to chose from battery life decent. Good tablet for kids
1,This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
1,Much better than expected. Easy to use and set up.
1,"like it a lil slow on boot , needs more freed space for other apps if i knew would have gotten 16gb"
1,I bought this tablet for my 9 year old nephew and he loves it. It is easy to setup and very user friendly. Picked up a case for protection.Buy far the best bang for your buck for an entry level tablet.
0,"Alexa is entertaining for music, questions etc. I was hoping for something more advanced, like being able to reminder for an appointment 15min before the appt. is schedule. You can set a reminder for 15 minutes....but only from the time you ask alexa...good for cooking but not much else"
1,"I love the ability to make my shopping list by just telling Alexa to add the item. The shopping list is always with me on the phone app. When my kids use the last of something, they can add it to the list. No more forgotten items. It is the easiest way to find out the forecast for your day. Just ask, no more getting on the computer or checking your phone. Really good sound for playing Amazon music too. Just ask for a song and it plays."
1,"The fire tv is great for streaming videos from various services. The amount of content available, allowed me to cancel my cable subscription."
1,Good overall.............................yep..good
1,"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
1,"Wish it was louder, difficult to get the base in the music in a large living room."
1,Bought it for my brother and he just loves it also the price is very reasonable. Highly recommended if you just need a regular tablet
1,I love my Echo! Very entertaining and informative.
1,Love the size and it capabilities! Was a great gift for my daughter!
1,Bought 2 for Christmas. One for a 3.5 year old and one for a 2 year old. It works well for them and if they trash it I'm only out $50 for a replacement.
1,This is I think the best product I've bought. I already own eight that I've purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price.
1,My daughter loves it. She has an IT background and loves any technology that is new .
0,It was so slow and problematic i couldnt even get in to the store. Switched to a Samsung and we love it!
1,Amazing.. jail break and you get free everything... TV movies whatever!
1,There's some fields I've notice that could use a power boost. I've been using it for about a month now and it gets slow at some points but for $40 I shouldn't complain
1,"After careful review, i have decided to reward my son with a Kindle paperwhite for his birthday. He has a new Dell lap top and sometimes uses a mini iPad but he really wanted a kindle of his own. I think he enjoys downloading his books to read for school and for leisure."
1,"Works just fine, but a bit on the expensive side!"
1,my kids love it. It fast and the camera is great. Easy to use
1,They came out strong with there best foot forward. Love it and use it daily
1,"I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this but I use it daily. really like the shopping list option, really helps"
1,We have been truly enjoying our Echo. The music is great. We use Pandora quite a bit. The local weather and news is also very timely.Still have much to learn on how to use the many fabulous features. And the weekly email updates are very helpful.Very good product for the home and easy to set-up.
1,"Bought this to install Kodi, Netflix and Hulu on. Definitely works as a multi source video device. It's slow but you can't beat what it can do for the money."
1,Bought this for my father for a gift & he loves it!!!
1,This product is a basic tablet that gets the job done. I wasn't looking for an established brand name tablet. Just something basic for a few apps I use and surfing the web and this tablet was well within my budget.
1,"Bought the WeMo wifi switch and plugged the tv into it, great for voice remote turning on/off the tv"
1,Got this for a friend as a birthday gift. He seen one that we had an fell in love.
1,"This is perfect for my needs. It is a great price for a tablet. No bells or whistles, just a tablet."
1,I can only hope this will bring the prices of cable tv down. Charter has made it impossible for you to afford television. Thank you Amazon for coming out with a solution!!!
0,"My mom bought this for my sister, she loved it. Great gift!"
1,Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
1,My first Kindle must have been defective as it was overheating. Because I bought it at Best Buy (and their return time was over) and not from the company all they would do for me was give me a discount on a second one. I finally accepted and the second one has worked perfectly. This is a good option for a cheap tablet.
1,I love the kindle and I can read at night without hurting my eyes
1,Love this tablet. So much easier to read than my previous ones. Great price too!
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is, hands down, the best e-reader out there. Text is sharp and clear. No glare. Simple to use. I'm reading more than ever."
1,This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it!
1,"Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon's OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great."
1,So much more than a reader. Kindle has come a long way.
1,"The amazon fire tv box is by far my favorite box. We have roku smart tv's ,chromecast, fire tv sticks and a few others and the fire tv Box gets used so much more than the others. The beauty of this box is not only does it work wonders if you have an amazon prime account , but you can add any android app to it by simply side loading it using an android phone or your computer. The interface is very user friendly as well. My 3 year old navigates it by her self just fine. I would recommend this box over roku or nexus player."
1,Previous one lost so wanted the same kind since I knew this was the best. It is my third Kindle and I love it.
1,Screen quality and size is good. Lightweight and good battery life.
1,From a fire stick to this speed difference is huge. KODI add on is a bonus.
1,"I love my amazon fire tv, there are a lot of great features. I highly recommend it."
1,"I like the Amazon Fire TV. It was easy to set up and begin using. We used a friend to help us load the various sites we were interested in, but I have since added some on my own and the set up was not difficult. I also own a Roku connected to another television but I prefer the Amazon Fire TV as it is easier to use."
1,Cool product. Amazon does a cool job with it. Great audio quality and like the Philips Hue integration.
1,This Amazon-Fire 7 is on fire meaning that it is a Hot Buy at Best Buy. It does everything I need it to do. Haven't had any problems.
1,Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies.
1,I love this device and it has changed my tv/movie viewing for the better!
1,This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus.
1,Easy to setup. Great peoduct. I want to recommend this product.
0,1 star...because it worked 1 time and stopped working.Returned it the very next day!My husband's Nexus charger and the Belkin 10W charger (that he got to replace this charger) do a GREAT job charging my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX!
1,Purchased this Fire TV box mainly to watch PlayStation Vue and it works perfectly with the service. Amazon Prime works great too as expected. No buffering or lag while streaming. Highly recommended.
1,Bought it for my kids and they love it. They can't put it down
1,"Your mileage may vary, but... I picked up both the Google Home and the Amazon Echo because I wanted to see which one was best. Oddly, Amazon Echo pairs better with my work accounts (GSuite/Google Apps for Biz) because Google Home doesn't do that yet. For home automation, Echo can't be beat. For playing podcasts, Echo is on top of it. For answering questions, Google Home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better sources. In terms of audio quality, Echo is top dog. Can it hear you from across the room? Yeah, in fact - mine can hear me from outside my office 3 rooms away.Has it changed my routines? Yep. I love the Flash Briefing. The skills, for now, are mostly useless or ""add-ons"" to the Flash Briefing. It can read your audio books and Kindle books (and they do a freebie monthly) - but as I listen at 3x speed to most of my audio books, it's not the most helpful thing ever (because there's no speed control yet).Is it the Computer from the Enterprise? Not yet. It can't perform complex tasks like, ""Alexa, find me a 4 or 5-star Chinese Restaurant nearby and make a reservation"", cannot call out (hey Skype, where are you?), and cannot send text messages or write emails.There's some connecting the dots that will have to happen for this to be life-changing, but for now, it's pretty good."
1,I like it very much good product . I used every day
1,Bought for gift for my 8 year old niece she loved it it's great for a starter and well priced
1,Purchased 2 of these Black Friday from our local Best Buy and gave them as gifts for xmas. Both people thought we spent a lot of money but we made out like bandits for under $40 each. GREAT PRODUCT ! Great gift for not a lot of money for anyone who your considering their first tablet. You can't go wrong here.
1,Great price! Easy to setup and the kids will not put it down. It's very light weight too. I bought 5.
1,The service was great and the help I received thanks
1,"Many options. Bye bye cable. Happy family, happy kids."
1,"Very easy to hook up, great to have all the extra channels, like ESPN 3."
1,Bought for son- great tablet for a great price!! Would buy again :)
1,"still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too."
1,Very nice display and high resolution! A pleasure to read.
1,"Did multiple reviews before purchasing this tablet for my daughter. Very nice, works well and durable."
1,This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I'm aiming at! Easy to use and can't beat the price.
1,Good and a lot of apps to pick from. And can connect straight to Internet
1,"This product is convenient for listening to music hands free, but not real user friendly. Alexa is not real knowledgeable and logic is at best that of a small child."
1,I bought this as a birthday gift for my dad and he LOVES it! I highly recommend this!
1,"Upgraded to this unit from a paperwhite (that I left on a plane somewhere).I find this unit to be a lot crisper, a lot speedier, and overall more pleasurable to use.I purchased the Amazon brand leather-type case with stand-up foot. It adds a bit of girth to hold on to, while reading.The unit is incredibly slim.Battery life is excellent - even when using the backlight."
1,"Love the amount of apps on this thing. Love that I can watch anything with Bluetooth headset while I'm cleaning. I love the speak to commend. However, I wish you can request more than one route for traffic reports. My husband and I travel to different locations everyday."
1,whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Was very impressed by the quality of the picture would recommend to everyone.
0,Great sound for music. Use it for a reminder each day. Kind of a to do list. When I need time or temp just ask Alexa
1,I have used this for a while now and what can I say .. just love it and worth buying ..
1,Works great! Super fast and does everything one would want.
1,"We have had several of the Kindles over the years. This was a replacement to an HDX (wish they still made those). The screen is big and very clear and easy to navigate. Kids play alot of games and use it to read books on for school. I would also recommend these to family members, like grandparents. The screen size and ease of use makes for less calls back to the family IT person."
1,"easy to use, has alot if features to entertain urself and ur family"
1,"Great product easy to use and scroll, better than a competitor product we purchased"
1,Very good product. Portable and easy use. User friendly.
1,"I love it, Alexa usually know most of the answer, worth the money"
1,"works like a charm, updates daily. use on a daily basis"
1,"I bought three of these tablets for my three boys (ages 9 - 13). The tablets were easy to setup and the boys love them. They seem to be very durable.I like the fact that I can connect them to my Amazon account and they have a lot of detailed parental controls available. I can, for example, limit time on games and movies separately from books so they spend their screen time actually getting some reading done. I can also limit total daily screen time so there is no struggle when it's time for them to get off the tablets.I'm very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the Amazon Fire tablet."
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and he absolutely loved it. He uses it for everything from news, weather to recipes and music. It's perfect for in the kitchen or living room. It also can be programmed for various things, it's awesome!"
1,This tablet meets my needs for going online or killing time when I'm bored. The battery holds longer than my cell phone. The only problem with these is that the port you connect the charger into isn't aligned easily and is pretty cheap. I can see how the tip of the charger would break easily. That is really my only complaint since I only paid 39 dollars when it was on sale.
1,"This product does too many things to even list. I enjoy listening to music, getting weather and traffic reports and just getting silly jokes. I also like that here are weekly email updates about he product."
1,I bought this looking to get rid of expensive cable and I love it. I can pick and choose what I want to watch instead of being charged a flat rate.
1,Entertaining and fun to quiz and listen to. Music is great.
1,If your student you're going to love Amazon TV. I'm a Amazon prime member because I buy books from Amazon all the time. With this box you can also have the benefits of streaming movies with your membership.
1,This thing is great so much better than the appli tv we got
1,This is one of the best shopping you can do for a child under 10 years
1,"Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school."
1,Great speakers for such a small item. I am enjoying learning and testing Amazon Echo...and Alexa...who is a lot better than Seri !!!!
1,My son loves this tablet. I love how you can regulate the time spent on this and control what your kids do on it.
1,"The simple set up, ease of use, and features of the Echo make it a cool little device to have around the house."
1,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use."
1,"I like it is nice and loud, the sound is nice and clear"
1,I brought the tablet for my step mom who isn't very familiar with technology. It was easy for her to operate and a great price.
0,The battery on this device cannot handle true apps outside of the Amazon ecosystem. Youtube and Twitch would drain the battery in under an hour. But if used as intended it would be great for books and email.
0,"This is exactly like any other usb power charger, making it unnecessary. A basic charger used for an ipod works to charge the kindle fire within 3-4 hours."
1,My daughter enjoy playing games and watching learning programs on device. Love the ability to secure adult information from kids by using a password.
1,I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
1,"Great quality, fun games for free, but NO free programming!"
1,Gave this tablet to a friend as a Xmas gift and they love it. Easy to use and the size is perfect!
1,"I got two Fires for the kids to tool around on while they're learning how to use a tablet and they are great. They're fast, HD, and have expandable storage."
1,Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
1,I love how easy it is to use Alexa! We use it mostly for music.
1,"This is a great product. I'm not sure if the charging port would mess up like a cellphone, but we'll see. I do have an issue with Best Buy. I returned it on Friday because it wouldn't charge anymore. I realized on Sunday, and they could not locate my sd card. They pretty much summed it up like it was my lost."
1,A fun and informative product. It is used by the whole family.
1,"We've tried a few different brands of tablets, between the DigiLand tablet my neice has or the Polaroid tablets we bought last year. Don't buy Polaroid. The brand used to be about quality, but their tablets are terrible. Slow, unable to process much, they needed to be restarted constantly from freezing.But Amazon's Fire tablet is amazing. My mom was so happy with it. It runs so well and is just overall AWESOME."
1,this is a fun & valuable tablet.we(three of us ) all enjoy games & the reading stories.
1,"This little tablet was a great purchase. My kids used it on a long trip, and they mostly watched videos and played games. The screen is pretty poor compared to higher-end models, but it's pretty great for the price. There are certainly superior tablets out there, but if you need a cheap tablet, this is certainly worthy of 5-stars for the class. The operating system, the touch screen, and the screen quality themselves are drastically lower-quality than a Surface, iPad, or Galaxy Tablet, but so is the price. So as long as you aren't expecting this device to rival an iPad retina screen, you should be pleased."
1,Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video.
1,Works as advertised. Never worry about dead battery.
1,One of the best and most price efficient tablets out there
1,Overall good tablet for kids. My 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it. Battery doesn't last anywhere near 7 hours though.
1,Finally a kindle for mom! Great value for the price!
1,This is a great product. Light weight. I wish it has wifi to download from online.
1,This was a great buy for me. You can watch many movies and tv shows for free
1,Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.
0,Not a bad tablet but well worth the $$$. The battery is horrible tho after about a year or so worth of use. It drops off quite a bit and the USB charging port has issues.
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great item help you with everyday things. Music, notes, shopping list, timers, etc."
1,I am glad to have made this purchase. I am pleased with the Amazon stick
1,Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
1,"we have multiple fire sticks and fire tv's in our house. They are flexible and customizable, big fan of this device."
1,"The only thing holding this device back is Amazon's unwillingness to play nice with other media companies and as a result it is very difficult to obtain certain digital items on this device if it is not immediately available on the Amazon store. Even so, very good purchase."
1,"What a delight, this Kindle is easy to use and is a very high quality item. I can read for hours with no eye strain."
1,Great stereo quality. You can ask Alexa to lower the sound volume or skip a song. Bought one for my son for Xmas and he loves it. Waiting to buy the charger.
1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it . It works well and very easy to understand.
1,"Finding new uses everyday. It's connected to my Nest thermostat, Harmony remote and Hue lights (yup, I'm a geek). Alexa even entertains my macaw with blues while I'm at work."
1,Received as a Christmas present and am enjoying it very much. Am still learning all the capabilities it has.
1,I love my Amazon echo! I utilize it with Amazon Music. Are use other music services like Pandora and I heart music. I listen to audiobooks and podcasts also
1,We bought a Samsung washer and a drier. Product quality is great and the customer service too
1,"Easy set up, effortless, bout one for my 80 year old father and he uses it without any help."
1,i have bought both the fire stick and the fire tv. This product is by far the best streaming device available on the market. i would buy more but i dont have anymore tv's.
1,I was looking at several streaming devices and decided on the Amazon Fire TV. It was a great choice. The device is very fast and has no lag at all. It works great streaming 4k content from Amazon and Netflix to my LG 4k TV. I would highly recommend this product.
1,I really enjoy reading much more. Especially like the rotate feature
1,"My daughter loves it,she gets to play her educational games"
1,This is a great first tablet for someone. Very inexpensive and has everything you want on it
1,"It's great - each of my kids received one last month for Christmas (ages 8, 12, 15). We gave it to them mostly for reading and they love them. Yes the younger two game on them and watch their shows as well, but most of the time I ""catch"" them reading. I thought the ads would bug them but they only appear when you initially turn on the device and that's it. No one's said a thing. Good screen quality too. We purchased a 32g SD card for each tablet for more storage."
1,35 dollar black friday day deal. My nephews love it.
1,purchased as a gift for my mom and she loves it. great starter tablet.
1,"The apps for the kids are slow and don't all show up on their home page, But other than that, it's great for the price and to entertain my 2 children."
1,"It takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed. Overall , once it's set up it's super easy to use. Works best if you have Spotify premium. Voice recognition is good and it improves over time. Sound quality is good. Battery is really good."
1,The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
1,"Goal: get an e- reader that allows one to read in any light situation. Goal achieved. Reading on the patio, beach is great. Easy to download books, lightweight, good battery life are all pluses"
1,I really like The echo. I was hesitant to buy the echo for such a long time.
1,I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!
1,My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
1,I love how much this tablet can do. It fits in my purse perfectly.
1,The Kindle is like carrying a library in your backpocket. It is fantastic. I carry it everywhere.
1,"We needed something easy to use for our bedroom tv watching. It was easy to set up and with our wired connection, it functions very quickly and is easy to navigate with the simple remote."
1,"My Alexa is the smartest! She knows a lot about everything! It's amazing how quickly she can answer a question, whether it's about math, history, a person, or event, etc. Even my husband is impressed!Played with my brothers Alexa for a couple weeks and ordered one for me. She was greeting me when I returned home. Love her!"
1,Installation was quick and I was watching in no time. Love the voice search and Alexa integration. Amazon integration is Perfect. Unfortunately the Voice Search only searches Amazon video and not Netflix like the Roku. For 4k this device supports 30fps and the Roku supports 60 fps. I don't know if that is a big deal yet or not until I get my 4K TV. I bought this because of the price point and I already had two Roku sticks. I also found that Amazon does NOT support certain movies on certain devices. i.e. I could not stream Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket on the Roku stick but it was available on the PS3. You have to look at Supported Devices in each movie to determine. When I started commenting on it in the Amazon forums they all of a sudden showed up :-)!
1,"Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it."
1,My Mom wanted a tablet to read on. I bought her the fire and she loves it. It is easy to use and inexpensive
0,it has a good picture low price. used for vacation condo.
1,"Great value for the price, recipient is enjoying it very much!"
1,Bought this for my dad and didn't want to spend a lot since I bought another pricey tablet before for them and works just as good!
1,Super fast compared to the stick. This gets used all the time and saved me money.
1,It was a gift for my girlfriend. It is her first tablet. It was easy to get started and she uses it a lot.
1,"I had a Kindle Color before. It was great, but the White Paper is way better. You don't need a light on to see the print. I use it a lot on airplanes"
0,I like it. Bought it as a birthday gift for a three year old and they love it
1,It has been great for the whole family. We all love playing our favorite music and the kids love the games like 20 questions.
0,I bought this as a result of my television internet connection being faulty. This was a good alternative to purchasing a new television set. It serves its purpose. My biggest issue is setting it up aesthetically with my television and sound bar
1,"I am satisfied with my purchase, I really recommend this item"
0,"I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish. I had to enter the same username and password for multiple apps over and over (you only have to do it once on the AppleTV)...may not sound like that big of a deal, but it took much longer to setup.In my opinion, the AppleTV is a better product."
1,The Amazon Echo is very simple to setup. We found the shopping list alone was enough justification for purchasing the device. Reading news and Kindle books are two of the options we use daily. Lots of potential for future uses.
1,I upgraded from a first gen Firestick. The Fire TV box is lightning fast. Tons of apps to play with. It could either be an addition to your cable/satellite tv experience or it could help you cut the cord.
1,As a tablet noob this was the perfect tablet to start with simple to use and even simpler to understand. I like every thing about it now I want a larger screen.
1,Works great with so many options. Haven't been able to get the 4k to work but that might be the hdmi cable currently connected. Everythings wotks extremely fast.
1,"Great device to have in your household. Ask Alexa the weather or sports scores, even turn on/off lights. Love it."
1,Easy to use economical and portable.I intially bought just for reading but it has been useful in apps facebook etc.
1,It is very easy to use. Like that font can be magnified. Clear screen is easy to see. Remembers where you stopped reading previously.
1,"This is a great item to use with kids. I like adding memory as needed. I love the kindle fire aspects....some items can be read by text to speech.I think the kids will like the camera, their old kindle fires did not have this."
1,Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
1,I love everything except that it is not compatible with ITunes
1,The kindle paper white is just like reading a book
1,Out the box this devise works good and plays well with others.
1,Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
1,My 4 year old daughter loved it. Also for my 2 year old baby
1,This device does some pretty amazing things from running your smart devices for you to making your grocery list.
1,My mom's not to tech savvy but this opened her world and made every day things she does on her computer at her finger tips while comfortably sitting in her living room or on road trips! About road trips she can book a room just sitting in her car that might of unavailable once she got Inside. I have seen this happen. Smart phones are great but when you get older to have a full screen makes it much easier! She loves also loves to read and there are so many books on Amazon she no longer has to run out the door to the book store or library Very helpful and fun when she can sit down and enjoy a card game with multiple players all over the world when no one is home!
1,Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy
1,Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
1,Bought it for my daughter. She loves it! makes me happy:)
1,Appreciate this modular option for directly charging a Kindle.
1,"I use this and my Apple TV, the amazon fire box is great you can watch your favorite shows through them and Hulu and Netflix, what makes the fire stand out is that you can add apps you can't find in their App Store, kodi makes cutting the cord so easy!"
1,"I would recommend this device over the google chrome cast, Apple TV, or roku products based on the ability to jailbreak the device/. It is very easy to jailbreak and well worth it with the step-by-step instructions available on the Internet."
1,Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
1,"very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos."
1,I thought I was buying a 9 Amp
1,Got this as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law. He loved it!
1,I bought this Amazon Fire tablet for my daughter and she loves it. It has good screen resolution and you can increase memory by inserting a micro sd card.
1,Awesome product we enjoyed a lot very easy to use with no problems
1,This item is amazing. It does so much and I definitely recommend it.
1,Better then advertised and am amazed with the quality/ performance
1,Love the paperwhite. It's light and small and perfect to throw in my bag and take with me wherever I go.
1,This device can do it all . The device also has nice voice command.
1,"Love it, it's almost perfect. Still needs some work on learning, but that will come with time. Right now it's a novelty, but who knows what's to come."
1,"I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of ""free"" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.)"
1,If you already have a Paperwhite then there is no need to upgrade. But if you are in the market this has an excellent display and quick page turns. The reason to buy a dedicated e-reader is the 3 week long battery life. Love it
1,I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix
0,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
1,We love these entry level tablets. We have bought at least ten of them for various family and friends.
1,"Love the tablets,they are a good deal for the money. My grandson loves it."
1,I have my Echo setup in my kitchen as that is where I get the most use of it. There is a learning curve to figuring out its limitations and getting it setup though. After that it is a fun device to use like I can add things to my grocery list or play a podcast or play Prime Music or turn on lights or give me the weather and sports scores. I am slowing setting my home up to have connected devices and this was a great starting device. I would say if you have spotty internet service this thing will not work but when you are on DSL you get what you pay for right?
1,"I was using another brand, from another vendor. Problematic. Continuation of reading erratic. When I began to attempt to read where I left off last, unit would take me back to random page or completely start the book over. Went through 2 readers, and both were faulty and very frustrating. The last stopped taking a charge. I read very good reviews of the Kindle. Pitched the other two (and they weren't cheap). The Kindle holds a charge for weeks not days and selection and price are light years ahead of the other service. Recommended to a friend and she loves it."
1,We have had fun with asking Alexa random questions that she readily answers in addition to enjoying the various stations and music lists available to us. I'm sure we will never exhaust Echo's abilities as it does a lot and we're sure enjoying it.
1,works fine.
1,"I may have set my expectations a little too high. This replaced a dedicated htpc, but I will probably swap it back and attach it to the garage tv."
1,Works for exactly what I bought it for Hubby to use for his worship music
1,I had heard of the Amazon fire stick through the Internet. I got to say I'm not disappointed at all with this purchase. It's a wonderful alternative to cable TV and it is saving me alot of money!
1,Easy to navigatePerfect for little ones  Buy a screen protector too !
1,Got this for half-price as a Deal of the Day! Love it!
1,We have enjoyed using the Amazon Fire tv. It is similar to Apple TV and roku but nice if you have a 4K tv and Amazon prime
1,Great product worth the money to pickup one of these models
1,Another Siri in the house. Echo. Is better. Great loud sound. Bought white. Love it.
0,Bought this on sale during Black Friday. Disappointed that there aren't more apps available. Will be returning.
0,Very slow.My 73 year old mother loves it.I would recommend this to a elder or a young child.
1,Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
1,Works beautifully. First I connected ethernet to Internet. Discovered wireless capabilities just as good. Great programing.
1,Control many aspects of your home with your voice. Links not only to amazon and your prime account but many other devices.
1,Grateful I have the hottest item of the year and it works great! Thank you Best Buy!
1,Love this item works great and is so useful in the home
1,Own the kindle from 2010. i bought this one because of the backlight.i can read without an external light source.Love my old kindle and love this one as well. Would highly recommend.
1,"My son gave this to me for a B-day gift! Music, movies, shows - and some news. Since I ""cut the cable"" I find that there really is very little news that I can't get elsewhere. No more news-fix required! Works with my Fire Tablet too!"
1,Purchased as a birthday gift for grandson and he LOVES it.
0,"So slow, camera not good, very low quality of picture.. Get Apple iPad mini instead."
0,I ran multiple different type of games. Can't handle.
1,This is very easy to read and just the right size and weight to carry.
1,"The Echo is a big part of our home life now. And just getting all the wireless home devices attached, it is a keeper. Buy it."
1,Nice e-reader. A bit smaller and definitely lighter than the Paperwhite. 'Whiter' screen still easy on the eyes. A bit expensive for just a reader however.
1,works well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
1,"Very cool device in general, and becomes even more convenient with every smart device you add to this system. I think the Google Home is smarter, but it's cooler to say, ""Alexa..."" vs. ""Ok/Hey Google..."""
1,Excellent sound quality. Sleek and fun. Looking forward to using.
1,"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
1,Love using it for the music and to keep a grocery list! She is the best. I bought 3 for my adult daughters for xmas.
1,Was easy to use and easy to set up programming was easy to do
1,4th one; I lose things. Would not buy any other reader. Can read outdoors. Shuts off when I fall asleep reading. Saves page.
1,"Love the speed, voice search and content this product provides!!!"
1,"The Echo is overall about what I expected, except that it's not very friendly with free music sites that I use often on other devices with no issues. Amazon obviously wants you to sign up Prime in order to get music from them. It also will not allow you to use Spotify's free service, only Premium. You can set up some of the other free sites, but that has to be done on the Alexa account. It's just a pain."
1,Love this voice activated device. Great sound for a single speaker!
1,Like my tablet very much. Camera good to learn with.
1,I would definitely recommend. It's great for every day use.
1,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.
0,Bought 3 of these black Friday for my kids they seem to be doing good so far hopefully they last.
1,I love my Echo and use her every day for information and entertainment.I love the daily flash report and the fact that I can ask her what the temp is and other things that I would have to look up. She plays me music that I love and need to relax with and gives me music that is not really available now like Bing Crosby.
1,"Alexa had been entertaining for the whole family. I really like the weather app, timer and news updates. The kids love playing music on demand. They are 5 and 3. It has also been a good way to teach sharing."
0,My kids get kind of lost when they use this product. It does have everything but is not as user-friendly as I hoped it would be.
1,Haven't used product yet. Still reading user guide
0,"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
1,The speaker does a nice job but I wish it had an aux out port so I don't have to bluetooth to use an external speaker.
1,"This is the second Kindle i have had. This has all the features that i need-It has my email, it is easy to read, it is easy to take wherever I go, it also has the books on it that i love to read. It has the further capability of taking pictures and has its own calendar. I recommend it to anyone."
1,I love the Amazon fire tv. I have so much access to television series and movies.
1,This Firebox is simple to install and use. Went for the box opposed to the stick for the faster processing option. Remember your electronics are only as fast as your internet!
1,I really enjoy my fire stick . Has a lot of movie entertainment for the family.
1,Great tablet for the price. We have a tendency to go through multiple tablets a year with the little kids. This is a great price and does everything we want for our young kids.
1,My daughter loves her new tablet no complaint she is happy and doing well I will probably buy one for me
1,I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet.
1,This is great. I can turn on music when my hands are dirty & turn it off with my voice. Alexa tells me a joke every day
1,The Amazon Echo is a wonderful piece of technology. I recommend it for anyone from tech expert to novice.
1,"Only used a few times since I bought it, but the few questions I asked answered them fast and correctly"
1,The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is has many features and small so you carry it around and light in weight.
1,Extremely simple to use upon powering the device up. Within a few minutes I synced my audio books & interfaced my email accounts in under 10 minutes. I'd definitely recommend this tablet.
1,"We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it"
1,"The FireTV is definitely faster than the Firestick and the performance is most noticeable when navigating across both native and third party menus. Relative to the Roku, the amazon user interface is lacking and a bit cumbersome to navigate. But all that doesn't really matter if you're getting it for the same reason I did--Kodi."
1,"Alexa is fun, she keeps getting smarter and smarter. Imagine Siri with music capabilities plus even more."
1,"This is the second unit placed in my home. You will be a little withdrawn at first but once you get answers from the unit, you will love it. I recommend you use the training to your voice when you first set the unit up. Do not hesitate to learn what the Echo can do."
1,My 3yr old grand daughter loves her new tablet! Now she can watch Mickey Clubhouse whenever she wants.
1,Buy this if you want to use PlayStation Vue. Don't get the fire stick!
1,Works great in the sun. Only complaint is that it scratches easily.
1,I am very happy with this purchase. It was super easy to set up. I especially love the voice control!
1,This tablet is actually really fast. The screen quality is also good.
0,"I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels"
1,I bought 2 of these as gifts for my nephews. They loved having their own tablets. Great price. Highly recommend!
1,this product works most of the time. there are frequent issues with reception
1,I love my tablet it is great for reading books and also playing games
1,Very nice tablet with many new features. Would highly recommend this tablet. My wife is very pleased with it.
1,This is having all apps handy and shopping easy with Amazon and awesome piece.
1,We have books and learning apps on it he loves it. I think that it's all around good tablet for kids or adults
1,Easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone whit kids
1,Amazon has hit it out of the park with this one simply amazing.
1,The tablet is good and great for younger kids free download
1,We purchased the echo as a gift for my wife. My family loves it.
1,My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!!
1,We bought this as a present for my grandma for mother's day. She was ecstatic!
1,"If your looking for a nice gift this holiday without breaking the bank, this is it. Great responsive tablet with a nice screen good battery life and Amazon echo system. A true bargain"
1,"Alexa is way more fun and practical than I thought she would be. She isn't anywhere near as smart as OK Google, but she sounds a thousand times better and I'm really happy to have her.Shopping discounts, Hue control, music, scores, and weather. She'll even read your Kindle books to you. I find myself saying ""Thank You"" after she does something. And yeah, I asked her to marry me."
1,Enjoying Alexa a lot. Easy to use and great provider of information and music
1,This is an improvement over the old Kindle. Have had it for a couple months and it works great.
1,"Purchased for my senior citizen, mother-in-law who is not particularly tech-savvy, but she's mastered this item and finds it easy to use."
1,"This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:)"
1,I got this for my husbands birthday. It is fun. We mostly use it to listen to music because it makes it so easy to find an artist. I wish I could change her name to anything I want
1,I like these tablets but I hate that you don't get insurance coverage on the $50 kindle anymore. The tablet itself is ok but it has too many slow downs and it doesn't update as it should.
1,"I loved this kindle fire tablet. You can't beat the price. It's great for in the car and as a back up system. It's not as good as my kindle paper white, but like I said, great for a back up and it has other features that the paper white doesn't."
1,"I love this little kindle. It's necessary to take advantage of your Amazon Prime membership. With that membership, you get to read, every month, one their amazon unlimited kindle books. To take advantage of that aspect of your prime membership, you have to read these books on your kindle, and can't be accessed on other android tablets. That's 12 books to read for free a year. Best of all, mine was on sale for $39.99."
1,Bought a tablet first had for a month hated it. Replaced it with kindle other people recommended. Love it
1,My wife loves her new Kindle. She is using it all the time. She replaced her 1st gen kindle e-reader with this
1,"Friends who have Amazon Prime were delighted to have the Amazon music library as well as all the other services at voice command. With the Amazon app on the smart phone they got shopping lists and many other linked services. It was the ""best gift ever."""
1,I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.
1,"Love my Echo. Has amazing stereo sound and has lots of new items added on a regular basis. I use it for nites, reminders, timers, setting alarms, music and general knowledge."
0,The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading
1,Love my tablet. Simple easy to use for reading and surfing the Internet
1,happy I purchased it. Have had no problems and was easy to set up
1,"I love my echo! Great product, still learning new things about it everyday!"
1,I bought this for a gift for my nephew and he loved it!!!
1,One of the best electronic devices I have ever purchased. Just a few things I wish it would do better like sync with Apple devices better.
1,Perfect.
1,This tablet was a gift for my mothers she is not into tech stuff she found it very user friendly and easy to navigate
1,Purchased for my mom and she said it was very easy to use.
1,I love the hands free feature of the Amazon Echo. The speakers are great and the music sounds great on it. My main reason for getting It was to listen to music but it does so much more!
1,"The Amazon Fire TV works better and faster than the Fire Stick. Every aspect of this is better, watching every show or movie starts up fast and is much clearer."
1,"Great product, makes life easier. Gaining in intelligence."
1,I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.
1,Better than fire stick a lot faster loading lots of movies and games great product
1,I had to replace my original Kindle and decided to buy the Kindle fire. The Fire has so many more abilities than my old Kindle but it is difficult to read in direct sunlight.
1,I really like the Fire TV. We've had one in our living room for several years and I bought this one for my wife for Christmas to put in the bedroom. Great utility and very easy to sue.
1,"How to do - not easy to find. Needs quick cheat sheet to accompany the product. I didn't think I'd like the back light but I do. I don't have a computer so it's hard to go on line. I'm not sure if I like how the books are arranged, but I'm slowly learning how to navigate around them. I had one of the original Kindles so changes are sometimes hard for us older people."
1,"Cool device , pretty much answers everything. Takes time to pair with other devices."
1,My 3 year old son loves it he will not put it down for the world!
1,Love it !!! Easy to use !!! Wonderful apps. Price was fantastic.
1,I got this to replace my Samsung tablet. I read alot and so i figured that the kindle would be ok to use. I have found that it works great with the books that I read and I really like the Blue Light feature making it easier to fall asleep reading.
1,"I have been a big fan of Amazon Kindles for the last five years. Each time a new one comes out I hesitated to buy, simply because my old one was working perfectly. Christmas I was looking for that gift that my wife would like. She too is a big Kindle fan. I grabbed a paperwhite for her for Christmas. For the next five days, I kept hearing how great it was compared to the old one. So off to Best Buy to buy the second. These are top notice upgrade. I don't think I have grabbed my Kindle and gotten the weak or dead battery logo. It has an amazing battery life. On top of that, the backlight works fantastic in low light environments. I can sit on a plane and read with no issues."
1,This is our family's 4th product of the same. All of us have one and they are lasting forever. Will never be without one.
1,"This tablet and the size is perfect for kids. Amazon also offers unlimited kid activities, for a small price of course."
1,"I received the Amazon echo as a birthday gift. I am not tech savvy, so set up was a bit confusing for me. Now that I have the features I want and need on the device, our household uses it everyday! In fact, we bought 3 as Xmas gifts!"
0,It's a basic tab. Only for reading. I didn't keep it.
1,The kindle was a gift and they are very happy with it. Purchasing it was a simple process.
1,This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere.
1,I purchased this tablet because it was so cheap! My husband loves it. It comes with many free games (games that you'd have to pay for if you had an iPad).
1,I bought this tab for my mother. I felt it was a great Christmas gift. She was very exited to see it and actually thought to get one. I might buy one for myself.
1,"Having had an original Kindle which I have enjoyed for several years, I decided to upgrade to the newest Kindle Voyage. I love the touch screen functionality and the lighted reading. I only wish I had done it sooner."
1,Alexa is the best. If you can get past your kids asking her every question that comes to mind. Great product.
1,"It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking."
1,Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
1,I purchased for reading. It has been everything I have expected.
0,"I bought this when it was on sale, and my rewards coupon was expiring so I felt I didn't have much to lose. Overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.The tablet is really fast for something in this price range. The screen has pretty good resolution as well. There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it. Still, it's not the tablet you would expect from an Android device. My satisfaction would improve greatly if Chromecast worked better."
1,I have been wanting to get a Kindle for my children and happened to see this at Best Buy. Couldn't pass up a fantastic Kindle at a great price.
1,I use this for music and for creating lists or for finding out what is going on in the world. I also use it to control other smart devices. Still elarning and it does have a little bit of a way to go to be really useful.
1,I love this thing! I use it to control my Hue lights and music. It's a great speaker too.
1,I love this for the sheer fact that I don't have to carry around all of the different books I am reading. Those books can get heavy! The syncing between reading and listening on Audible has really improved since I tried using it with the original Kindle Fire tablet.
0,Nit sure was s gift not sure what the product is like
1,"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
1,"This was a gift for someone else, but I really enjoyed my own too."
1,SO FAR I LOVE HER! just wish that i had better wifi rather than broadband at home...
1,Bought for my parents fur Christmas. They live them. Very simple and easy to use
1,Just as imagined very good product
1,Bought this for my daughter to keep her busy in the car and flights. Works great. Good content.
1,I was not expecting much and was a little afraid to purchase the fire tablet. I was quite surprised by the build quality and am extremely surprised by the performance. I am thinking of buying more for the family.
1,Best gift for my 10yr. old. Even uses it for homework.
1,We love the tablet and its functionality. You can't beat the price and get the same quality.
1,Very nice streamer! This is my second Fire TV so I like the product... On some apps the UI is way better then the Roku's. Highly recommended ... but also have 2 Rokus.
1,"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it."
1,"For someone on the go this is ideal for eliminating the hastle of always keeping your phone on a charger. Lasts several days if you have charged it!! Family member goes to school in Canada and always traveling. Ideal for this individual, works phenomenal. Will only take the charger supplied but if an additional is required you may substitute with others out there (ps4) if in a pinch it works."
1,The Echo was easy to setup. It understands my commands most of the time.The only complaint is that it's speaker is not up to par with other speakers.
1,Really good tablet for the priceI can't complain ...
1,"The Amazon Kids Fire keeps my grandson captivated with lots of activities. He loves that it's just right for his little hands. He makes sure that everyone in the family knows the Kindle belongs to him by saying, ""It's mine!"""
0,"It is very good, but very limited to the number of applications that it can support."
1,"The Kindle paperwhite is the perfect e-reader. The screen resolution, size, and capacity make a complete package. If your objective is to read, this is the optimal product. If you want to play games or are enamored with color for magazine viewing, do not purchase this product."
1,This is really easy to use. It understands many voices and does what you ask.
0,"I bought this to go with the Toshiba 4K TV with built-in Chromecast I bought from Best Buy. It's nice when it works but I had problems with it that caused me to return it.I have a Fire Stick and it works great. I leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks, otherwise it works fairly well. The Fire TV had to be unplugged after every use. The screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound. If I left it plugged in for any amount of time, then it would not work well. I liked the voice search on it and Alexa works great. You can ask for the weather, play music, and presumably other things that the Echo, Dot, and Tap can do. Just a side note, you have to keep the button pressed when asking Alexa to do something.Maybe I had a defective unit, maybe it was something else. But I've had a Paperwhite and a Voyage that both died on me in similar ways. I've never had a problem with the lower end Kindles or Fire tablets. Based on my limited experience, Amazon just doesn't get its higher end products right. I'm still going to use Amazon for a variety of things, but I no longer trust them for the higher end products that they make and sell."
1,This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
1,This was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it.
1,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one."
1,This thing is the coolest thing time play with love it
1,Much better than the stick. 4K works great and having an Ethernet Jack is greatly appreciated. Snappy menus.
1,Great for the avid reader. Plenty of storage space and fun for basic internet activities.
1,This is a good tablet for your everyday used!!!!!!
1,I needed something that will easily connect to hotel WIFI cause I travel a lot so researched all devices and saw that the Amazon Fire was meant to connect to hotel WIFI with ease and I must that this device lives up to what it says it hooks up with to the hotel wifi with no problems great picture and fast steaming and I now use this at home as well I love it.
1,"Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free ""May Day"" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time."
1,I have to repeat myself when alexa is at volume 8-10 at a short distance.
0,I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.
1,I love the new kindle. So much brighter then my old one.
1,"Great tablet for the price if you are a user of Amazon's services. Plays movies, videos , music from Amazon's Prime service great. If you don't use these, it is an OK android tablet. Does not support the Google Play Store directly but can be sideloaded. Not a great experience tho."
1,"Great for family especially my kids. Alexa has been keeping them busy - engaging them by answering unending questions, playing music, educational insight (history, geographical, science, math...). In addition we are now almost always playing our Christian worship music on the Echo. Hands down the Echo has become the greatest addition to our family among all gadgets.."
1,a nice tablet for a very good price. It has everything other expensive tablets do.
1,"Fast and easy to use. Kid friendly :) Simple to navigate, clear and clean picture."
1,"Works Great, Flixster is a little slow compared to vudu but at least I can still view my movies from vudu."
1,Easy to set up. Love the Alexa integration. Very happy!
1,We purchased this for mu husbands mother and she seems to really be enjoying it and it seems user friendly for her
1,"Bought this as a giftt for my wife. She uses it mainly as a method of reading books and loves it. The memory is more than sufficient for normal usage and is expandable if needed. The fact that it is not HD does not matter to her but if you use it to watch a lot of movies, you might want to spend the extra $100 bucks and get the HD. JShe does watch Netflix on it but usually watches movies on our big screen television. Great buy for the money. She loves hers"
1,Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
1,This product is great !!!! I would recommend this to family and friends
1,Fast delivery from Best Buy as always. The fire stick is awesome. High Quality video great selection. Good Value.
1,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
1,My daughter loves this tablet. She drops it and it keeps going. she can't put it down.
1,My wife likes it. She reads a lot so she uses it all the time. Also likes to go online with it.
1,My wife loves her new Kindle Fire. Great add for the front a rear facing camera as well as the basic features. Another add for this devise is the added storage option.
1,Enjoy using the Kindle White paper. It is compact.
1,"My granddaughter loved her tablet and the color. It's amazing how easy it is for her to use, perfect birthday gift"
1,This is ok for kids but the camera is not bright enough.
1,"She can do all kinds of things with this, especially with all the skills we can enable in Amazon!"
1,Clarity is excellent. Easy breezy to use. Charges quickly and lasts a long time
1,This is a decent eBook if you are only interested in Book Reading. not a colored screen but so do not compare it with any iPAd / Pad ... good for reading. Good gift for Senior citizens.
1,"I'm so happy with this product, so many channels and best of all no more cable company. Just to give you all an idea, I was PAYING about $$$$125.00 plus, plus, plus amonth, in cable, that's about $$$1500 plus, plus, plus a year. So now I with NETFLIX, AMAZON PRIME & SLING TV going to pay about $40.00 a moth, that's about $500 per year..... Plus there is other goodies that comes with it. Excellent streaming capabilities never lose it signal. Excellent product AMAZON"
1,"The Kindle hasn't been used much yet, however, it appears that all family members interested in various options available...music, games, internet, books, etc."
1,Grate product! I would definitely recommend! Say good bye to cable!!!
1,It's a great kindle for the price. Eyes don't get tired from reading it
1,"So far I only see one flaw that bothers me, no volume control built into the remote, the device is very fast, easy to setup and use, though it does offer prime video stud right up front, but a couple pushes of a button and your on to your Netflix or hulu or what have you, works great with plex as well."
1,"This is a great tablet for my young son, he is able to order books for school. He plays games and he is able to go onto youtube for the fraction of an Ipad. It is great!!!"
1,My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
1,"The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use."
1,I recently purchased this product. I am satisfied with this Amazon firestick. Good for 4K picture
1,This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price.
1,Easy to use and great clear image. Only use it as a digital book/magazine. Don't use camera.
1,A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else.
1,"Alexa is really awesome, she does all kinds of cool things to make life easier. My only recommendation to Amazon is that they try to make her more 'intuitive' and remember habits or repeated phrases."
0,not as smart as the commercials show. cant answer a lot of questions
1,Handy and entertaining device to have. Ask it anything and it will answer. Haven't tried advanced features yet.
1,Very loud. Great sound. Sub Slides under couch so it doesn't get stepped on
1,My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
1,I purchased this as a gift for a child. After I read tons of reviews and asked my nephew how he liked his... It was GREAT for the price i just wish amazon would allow you to sync your google play.Other than that great product and great experience at best buy :)
1,"I love my PCs and they are in constant use, but my new addition to the family, the Amazon Fire tablet, now provides me the convenience and portability that I'd been previously missing. Every time I pick it up and turn it on I experience something new to explore and use. A real winner!"
0,Decent tablet. I knew it wouldn't be fast but it does get the job done and it was relatively cheap.
1,Easy to use...lightweight. Easy to read. prefer this font to that of ipad or computer
1,"I'm writing this review after one month's use of the Amazon Fire 7 tablet (2015 model, aka ""fifth generation"").Pros:-- Good (though not great) image quality;-- long lasting battery;-- Amazon very good at updating device.Cons:-- not HD (though Amazon makes no claim of it);-- very slow battery recharging;-- claimed quad-core processor is rather slow.Particularly for beginners, this a fine device for simple web browsing; common app use; etc. Camera and photo management are adequate. App store is Amazon's (not Google Play); and processor is much too slow for any kind of advanced gaming. Updates are helpful; device did not come with Alexa ability, but Amazon has since installed an Alexa app. For $39, it's a reasonable value."
1,We purchased this after we decided to get rid of cable. Very easy to navigate much better than using a game system.
0,Until I buy all the lights and linked products this is just a radio with limited stations.
1,It's a very useful tablet. Did not have any problem since bought. Works out of country too and during travel.
0,"We purchased this for our 5 & 4 yr olds. It is something to help with learning to read and write.The big downfall is that even the ""free"" apps require you to purchase add-ons to unlock more of the app."
1,I got this for my wife to use in her sewing room along with our Amazon Prime Music membership.The sound quality is about the same as a good quality bluetooth speaker and fills the room nicely. And it's great just asking for music and having it play!
1,It is reasonably priced so you can replace if need be. The small size is perfect for kids especially when travelling.
1,Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
1,Got it for my husband....he loves it! I wish I had gotten it for him sooner!!
0,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
1,best decision I made this month. best tablet for the best price
1,This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
1,We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.
1,"This product works great as a little helper and as a great speaker for music. I purchased this for my mother in a nursing home, she loves it! It is very easy to set up and use."
0,takes 30 minutes to connect to wifi and none of the apps work on it and i restored it 3 times already. Big and bulky. you will be better to get the more expensive model
1,"I bought this after being an avid Apple fan for the last 10 years. I had old style two Apple TV's and even bought a new Apple TV to help with me cutting the cord to DirectTV after 11 years. I switch to using the Apple TV with the DirecTV Now streaming service. After the Apple TV would no longer let friends or family airplay to it because of new updates or let me load any third party apps I knew it was time to switch. It was a great switch to the Fire TV and I have not looked back. I have been able to load numerous apps that are not available on the Apple TV such as Showbox and Kodi. My biggest complaint was the Fire TV remote was not able to control the volume on my sound bar like the Apple TV remote and was not able to turn my TV or sound bar on or off. The Sideclick remote was exactly what I needed. I was able to program the remote to control power and sound level, along with change the input on the TV. I would highly recommend using the Fire TV.Pros:Works extremely wellAllows 3rd party app installationMuch cheaper than Apple TVAllows use of amazon music which Apple TV did notCons:Home page is not at visually pleasing as the Apple TVRemote does not have volume controlsRemote is not touch sensitive and has a very loud *click* noise when pushing buttons."
1,This tablet is great for my kids watching youtube and netflix on.
1,Love it ! very easy to use!!! Good picture for movies!
1,t is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
1,"I love the Fire Tv box, it offers the voice recognition remote and an ethernet input if your WIFI happens to be shotty."
1,My family loves it. How we can just ask a question and it responds and does certain things for us
1,"great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,"
1,It is a nice Kindle for the price. Works and runs well for all i needed
1,I bought the tablet as a gift for a friend's daughter in another country and they just luv it. She is the talk of her province because of the usefulness and learning games that came with the tablet.
0,You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 2 year old it's ok
1,Easy enough for a 5 year old to use and with the chip added he can add games to his tablet
1,Alexa is great and helpful when needed. Controls my house lights from philips hue and wemo and harmony remote.
1,My kids love these. They are easy to use and no glitches!!
1,This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it
1,This is the third Kindle I have purchased ( two as gifts) and am very pleased with the purchase!
1,"This is my first tablet, and I have had for just a short while. So far, it seems to be a great product for the price. I plan to use it primarily as a reader, which will allow me to stop accumulating books in my small apartment! So the small form factor seems to fit that purpose, and it's a bonus to have a browser and the availability of lots of apps too."
1,i can read anytime and anywhere.....................
1,The Fire is a good deal for the amount of money it cost. Simple to use and has a nice screen display.
1,The Amazon Fire TV is amazing. I highly recommend!
1,We bought this for my father's tv. He is so happy with it! He can easily navigate throught all the apps and play what he wants! I can only say this product works really good!
1,This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
1,It has a lot of potential that I haven't tapped into yet but it's met my expectations so far.
1,Works great and I haven't had any issues. Easy to use.
1,"With the advent of technology, picking up and reading a normal book feels cumbersome. This device perfectly replicates real-life ink whilst providing an unobtrusive backlight and enhancing the books with extra information, dictionaries, and wikis."
1,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!"
1,"I am so very i got this for my 3 year old grandson. He can navigate it to get to his favorite shows, Peppa pig, Mickey clubhouse and Thomas the train. He is so happy with his tablet."
1,I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. I use it everyday for all kinds of information.
1,Works fine. Alittle pricy. Kindle without is not good.
1,The speaker sounds so much better than the dot. I stream music through there constantly.
1,Much better than any other streaming device and it has many options and allows you to be wireless or direct through Ethernet. I have it setup so I can watch many of the movies and shows I like. Glad I went with this!
1,"Bought it so my son could play ABCMouse.com without his baby brother closing it on hom, like he does with the laptop. Also good for my audiobooks."
1,I love asking Alexa questions and having her turn the lights on and off.
1,This portable Bluetooth speaker has an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the Echo and Echo Dot which both have to be plugged in. Want to listen to a favorite song? Just ask Alexa. Want to know the weather report? Just ask Alexa. Want to know your horoscope? Just ask Alexa. A lot of fun and entertainment at a great price. Big things come in small packages!
0,"Disposable tablet, almost like a burner phone. Works ok, but need SD card, very little space."
1,Perfect tablet for beginning reader. Great for games and videos.
1,My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.
0,"I should have waited until this was more advanced, it keeps disconnecting from the wifi and it's a pain to reboot it, doesn't know much either, we have only had it 3 weeks so we will see how it grows with us"
1,I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
1,"Minimum setup required.Glossary of terms is somewhat limited.Design is attractive and fits into any décor.Sound is good (not Bose, but acceptable)Easy to add features (calendar, To Do List, reminders, etc."
1,"With an amazon prime membership you have ""Alexa"" play all kinds of music. Haven't really used any of the other features yet."
1,"4 k capabilities, Ethernet direct hook up to router for faster streaming, voice remote control! Much better and not so restricted like Apple TV! A+++"
1,"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
1,Had high expectations. Alexa can't answer many of my questions. Setting up music hard as heck.
1,yeeeeaaaahhhhh kids love this and so do i...thanks again
0,The thing broke within the first week. The charging port was bent and it wouldn't charge.
1,Cancelled my dtv and this is everything 8 hoped for
1,Great product. Has so many outstanding benefits. Love this product
1,"The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet"
0,good product for this price. I like my Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black
1,"I purchased this product for my ten year old daughter. She absolutely loves it! It was easy to use, simple to navigate, and even easier to set-up (especially all of the parental controls and such). I am able to manage her account online and limit her use and time on the tablet, as well as keep track of any purchases she may wish to make. It is a great starter tablet for a responsible youth."
1,got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire
1,Love everything only negative is the ads. My 9 year old daughter has claimed it as her own and operates easily.
1,My 3rd Amazon Fire TV (for different rooms) and it is such a great product. Much easier to navigate then the built in smart TV functions for watching other apps and it is much more responsive for searching for shows using the voice controlled search function.
1,Gave as a Christmas gift. Have gotten great reviews about the streaming features and they love the voice remote!
1,I had the old kindle with no back light .. this new one was a great price .. I still use both but this is great on a plane or in bed at night when I can just turn it off and I don't have to get up and turn my light off
1,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it.
1,Love this kindle - the press side page turner is great.
1,I love my kindle! It never runs out of battery. Used it on a three week detachment and never had to charge it.
1,Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must
1,Perhaps the best ereader made until now. Fantastic reading experience.
1,I purchased strictly for PS VUE and can confirm it works great including 60FPS and lag-free (almost as good as PS4) guide navigation. It is drastically improved in speed over the 2nd gen fire stick ($40) which had too much navigation lag and capped at 30FPS. The Fire TV is much faster and worth the extra money as it also includes 4K and a gigabit ethernet port. It does lack VUDU and Google Play so not all apps are available and will not likely be available due to Amazon Prime proprietary service. Overall it functions great and is very FAST!
1,Now my bedroom TV is the smartest TV in the house. The voice command makes this a breeze to use. It hooks me up to Netflix in seconds instead of minutes like the blue-ray players on my other TV's.
1,As an Amazon Prime media consumption device it can not be beat for the price. If you are not a Prime member don't bother. Put the fifty bucks toward an iPad which can't be topped for a media device.
1,Good sound and very intuitive. Ask for an artist and voila! It's there. Haven't connected Bluetooth bulbs or outlets yet but plan on in the future
1,I bought for my father and it’s perfect for him. He loves being able to set reminders and play music he wants.
1,"Alexa is good for basic needs, weather, timer, streaming, but lacks the ability for proper search abilities like google. Also, the ability to stream books needs work."
1,I think my Aunt likes her new toy. It is Amazing how technology marches on. This unit is perfect as an introduction to the tablet for people. Even if you have other tablets this is a wonderful addition because you can take it with you as if it's a throwaway. It has the slot to expand memory and the headphone jack has plenty of power and quality sound. It supports Bluetooth audio also. Any gadget freak should add this to their collection.
1,"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
1,"Very simple setup. Within minutes I was using and discovering some fun entertainment. I am not an Amazon Prime member yet, but I expect being a member will open even more wonderful entertainment."
1,Would reccomend. Bought one for my daughter. Prefer over my expensive larger tablet.
1,"This Kindle in the largest,thinnest yetfastestand most durable. We purchase the geek squad insurance with it kindly. Best decision ever."
1,easy to read on the beach in bright sunlight. good battery life
1,got one for me and for my older daughter. love it a lot
1,It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot
1,"I bought a bunch of these as gifts. They were a huge hit. The tablet has better functioning than its older versions (which also cost 3x more). I would 100% recommend anyone that wants a tablet for recreational daily uses like searching the web, reading, watching videos, playing games, and checking mail."
1,has good download speed. great color and clarity. sound also very good
1,Really nice. Small enough to cary in a purse or brief case. Easy to use and lighting is good. Just need to buy a case to protect the glass.
1,Got this tablet for my 6 year old and she loved it. Easy to use.
1,As expected. i would suggest to get a cover. The dictionary is very easy to use.
1,The kindle white is an excellent ereader which is lightweight. It allows you to hold with one hand with no problem. Additionally there is enough room on the sides to hold with two hands without making pages constantly turn.
1,"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page."
1,I got this tablet for an 8 year old who only plays video games after her homework or on the weekends and it works prefectly fine for that purpose. I never tried to push it to its likits and see how good it could be for an adult. But she hasnt given menone complaint.
1,Easy to install! We bought two one for each tv!!!!
1,"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
1,Kids love it and well integrated with Harmony remote
1,Small enough for a purse and works great. I would recommend memory card.
1,"I'm very happy with the Kindle Paperwhite (2015 model). I didn't like reading e-books on ""typical"" tablet screens, which are much better for movies and games. The screen on the Kindle Paperwhite, however, is built exclusively for reading, and in that regard, it really excels. Text is sharp and easy to read in any lighting condition, from darkness to bright sunlight. Additionally, the device is lightweight, easy to carry, and fairly durable."
1,"easy to use, plenty to watch. Easy enough to set up."
1,"For the price you cannot beat the deal on a tablet. Crystal clear picture and very fast. OK, so the wide variety of apps available on an apple or Android are not here. But most major apps are, and if the app is not available just go to their website. A simple fix."
1,"I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Fire - First Edition. This one is really nice. Graphics are superb as is the speed in loading. I don't know, yet, what else it can do as I haven't explored it thoroughly. It's like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet."
1,Great tablet which lets you hook into the content of the Amazon ecosystem easily.
1,I'm not one for reviewing usually but my oh my do i love this thing. It is lightweight and amazing!! I LOVE HOW CRISP IT IS AND HOW BRIGHT IT IS.
1,I am extremely thrilled with my Amazon Fire Tablet. It is definitely worth its price!
1,"The clarity of any audio coming out of the Amazon Echo is truly incredible. I bought one because a friend of mine let me barrow his before I got Lasik surgery. I needed stories to keep myself busy and from going crazy. She has different ""skills"" she can learn and provide, that is if you remember the command for said skill. Great for news, quick weather updates on your area, etc. Fantastic product."
1,We have a smoke glass case so this works excellent for us.
1,"I bought this tablet for my girl of 12 years old ,and I bought the fire kid tablet for my other kids ,they loved it , is an great tablet , great prices, easy to use it , the tablets came with cases so everything is in the packet for one prices ,so I'm really happy with this product"
1,"- A MUST for Amazon Prime subscribers - lots of media content - For PlayStation Vue subscribers, it's speedy and fast; works great- Noticeably faster than 1st generation Amazon Fire Stick- High-quality feel of the remote control- Smartphone App works grea"
0,"I purchased this tablet because I saw that it was at an affordable price point for me. With this, it's really not that bad. The only 2 things I've found to be able a little bit annoying is that it's a little awkward to hold/handle when I'm playing my games. The second issue I've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic & its noisy. The overall performance is quite impressive though. Good price point, with good intentions, just a little cheap feeling & a little big in the hands to hold."
1,holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had
1,Streaming is easy on this 4k ready box. Love the picture quality too. Plus the kids can play games on the big screen.
1,Very clear HD video..love it and at a wonderful price
1,i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe
1,Good replacement for a paperwhite. The addition of the page forward and page backward buttons is huge!
1,I currently own an Amazon Fire Kindle. My kids love this one. It's the perfect size for them.
0,"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."
1,Its a good product and also you can be monitoring what can your kids see
1,"Everyone should have one of these, It will tell you everything from the weather to the sunrise and sunset. you can listen to radio stations from anywhere. I liked it so much that I bought three dots to extend to other rooms."
1,Reads like a book instead of a tablet. Saves on book storage space and is always on hand. Looks good sitting on my nightstand. No clutter.
1,"this is the best ereader in the market, the battery last a least 4+ weeks with one charged"
1,"Overall this is a good streaming device. Pro: Almost every service is available. SlingTV performance here is better than Nexus TV, Fire Stick, or Chromecast. Can do some casual gaming. Available cheap with the SlingTV Best Buy deal. Cons: Sometimes returns to home screen. Included controller sometimes disconnects. UI is better than Roku, but that isn't saying much."
1,It's nice to have a small tablet to have for email and to store pictures with the micro sd slot. Nice screen and ability to store Amazon prime movies to view without a wifi connection.

1,It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
1,"This was a great replacement for my previous Kindle, which is more than 5 years old. However, I liked my old Kindle well enough, and I couldn't justify an upgrade considering the more than $100 price tag. That's why I waited for a one-day sale to pick up the Paperwhite."
1,i bought this for a christmas gift. my granddaughter loves it and it was inexpensive.

1,Bought this for grandson because it was cheaper than a kids tablet. Bought a case and it works fine.
1,"I purchased this for my family and put in the family room. Everyone likes to use it for music, trivia, sports scores and just having some fun. Sometimes it doesn't understand the question or have the answer."

1,"After searching online for the best price, I found this on bestbuy.com. I ordered it and picked it up at our local Best Buy the same day. Great product at a great price."
1,I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational.
1,This is a Christmas gift. Hiwever it did come recommended

1,I loved the kindle fire so much that I purchased a second one for my husband.
0,Bought another one because first one stopped working. Seems to match the cheap price. Made cheaply.
0,The processor was so slow. It took about five minutes to load a five minute YouTube video with 50 Mb/min. Internet.
1,They love it from the kids. I have this by myself it is really good I would buy it for anyone
1,Can't complain about the value of this kindle for a great price. Gets the job done and is perfect for my 4 year olds studies and games.

1,My grandson is 6 and he loves this tablet.. Easy for him to us and a great price.. Well worth it
1,"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
1,"Bought 2 for my Granddaughters, one is 5 and one is ten, they had the best time ever playing with them. You can control all access, so it works great for both and their parents feel secure."
1,The power of battery lasts longer than any tablets.
1,"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
0,I have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. I would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. The tablets work good for the most part but I would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.
1,The lighted white screen makes for better reading for your eyes.
1,"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
1,Great Tablet for South America. Much more expensive there. it works great and is very fast. No problems getting it on the SA network.

1,So fun and exciting and informative :) it was a present for my boyfriend and he calls her his real girlfriend lol
1,Much better than I expected for the very reasonable price.
1,I decided I need a device dedicated to my Amazon account so I purchased this. I have been using my iphone and ipad but wanted to have a device specifically for books. I've had kindles before and the products are so good.
1,Streaming videos finding anything you want all the apps you need. I guess I don't need cable anymore
1,"Does everything you need for ""daily"" use. Easy to set up, easy to use, price is great!"
1,Ni problem at all. Run good easy to use. The remote very usefull
1,"This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee."
1,really good value for the price. Easy access to internet and operation.
1,"This was the fourth ECHO we have purchased. The first one was for home, an award from RealtyUSA.com. The last three were Christmas presents for all the Grandchildren. they just love it. When we are out our dogs listen to classical music on the ECHO!"
1,I bought 2 tablets. One for my oldest daughter an then one for my husband. Haven't had any issues with either. About to buy another one for my youngest now

1,nice tablet function well great item for surfing the Web easy to use and set up yes I would recommend
1,"My daughter loves it. Was a little hesitant because of it being Amazon ad machine, but it turned out to be a great purchase"
1,THIS TABLET IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. ABLE TO PLAY GAMES WATCH VIDEOS AND USE THE INTERNET. ITS GREAT FOR KIDS AS WELL
1,"Good qualities , capable of answering 80% of all questions. Somewhat disappointed."
1,"A friend had an Amazon Echo and my wife loved it. I surprised her with one for her birthday. She uses it everyday for weather, news and music. Great device and easy to use"
1,"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
1,"Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
1,"This fast charger gets my Kindle HD up to 100 in about two hours much, much faster than the regular 5W charger.-It doesnt hog two outlets when you plug it in. This new design is taller and narrower than the old square charger so it doesnt cover two outlets in a power strip. Its about 2.5 tall, 1.5 wide, and 1 deep.-It has a USB socket. You can use any Kindle micro-to-USB cable of any length. I use the economical AmazonBasics Micro-USB to USB Cable - 6 Feet with no problem.-It charges my Kindle HD from 25 to 100 in about two hours.My only quibble about it is that the two power prongs dont fold into the body of the charger for storage as they did with the old version. But thats just a quibble."
1,Best Birthday present I ever got... I have my lights set up using Alexa and thermostat.. Also use the shopping list everyday helps to remember when I am at the store shopping.. love playing millions of trivia games and all the information she gives all day.. also love the many new apps added almost ever day... I Love my Alexa I highly recommend it!!
1,Very nice to have in the kitchen/living room area… Just ask what the weather is… The time… Play music… The news… Turn lights on… Works great!
1,"One of the coolest pieces of tech I own !! Playing music on command is just one fun feature of the Amazon Echo, it is capable of so much more."
1,Better than advertised. Stunning sound quality! Long distance voice recognition is spot on accurrate
0,We're finding it hard to navigate this thing. Others (mostly the young ones) think it's easy.
1,"Nice tablet , does everything i need and easy to use."
1,"This was supposed to be a gift for Christmas, but after I bought it , I had to keep it for myself."
1,picked up this fire tablet for the simple reason of reading ebooks purchased through kindle rather than on my phone. it's small enough I can stash it in my bag and easy on the wallet if anything happens to it. go ahead and pick up a case for it and maybe a glass screen protector for added piece of mind
1,I got this for only $50 with my Harmony remote and I really like the way it works
1,"So far fire tv has been just what I expected, works well, gives me what I wanted,"
1,I bought this for my God daughter whom just wanted to FaceTime on Facebook messenger. Works great for the price.
1,"All of our kids - ages 4, 7 and 8 - have had their own Kindle Fire for almost two years. They're generally pretty careful with them since they've been told that broken Kindles will not be replaced. In one case, the Kindle simply stopped working - it would no longer turn on. There was a great deal going on so we did replace it. What a perfect product for a child! So many apps are available and they can learn new things while thinking they're just having fun. ;)"
1,Little bit of learning curve but love it now. Probably will buy fire stick for other tv.
1,"So far so good. Inserted the micro SD card into my tablet and it works fine. I must say that it took 6 days to get here. If they had put it into the US mail, it would have been 3 days. UPS took forever and then they gave it to the USPS. DUH??!!! Amazon is better on shipping."
1,Bought this to use in the kitchen for just recipes and pinterest but have wound up using it for a regular tablet! Fast loading and easy to use. Since I already have an Amazon account I now have free Alexa and so many other benefits
1,"This thing is amazing, I use it to control lights, music, get news/ weather updates!"
1,Both my husband and I like to refer to Alexa for information. My husband especially likes to have her set the morning alarm. He is constantly asking Alexa to set a timer.
1,"I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet."
1,"Great device: perfect sound, very accurate voice recognition throughout the entire house. A lot of services available (some requires a monthly fee though) and several connectable voice controllable devices.Worth the price."
1,Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
1,Good product at low price... and very good image resolution
1,Easy to install and great for home! Every home should have one!
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great device that continues to evolve. Not perfect yet, but the fact that it continues to get better with new skills is encouraging. Setting it up and connecting to my other smart devices was easy and has worked seamlessly ever since."
1,Amazon has a really nice platform and this tablet is fantastic for those folks who do not to spend a few hundred dollars on an Apple ipad Mini.
1,"I bring it when hanging out outside, exercising, doing housework anywhere my echo won't hear me"
1,"This kindle has been great, I upgraded from an original kindle and haven't looked back.I think if you have one of the paperwhite's with the backlight you might not see enough bang for your buck to upgrade though."
1,This is great for e-reading and basic internet use.
1,I own many tablets but for 40 bucks this was a no brainer. Great buy.
1,"Ok several good features, just wish camera was better"
1,"I transitioned from an unneeded iPad to this Kindle. The pages are incredibly clear, even during the day. However, you obviously cannot surf the web with this tablet. It's only for reading."
1,Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy.
1,Need an alternative or supplement to Cable TV? This is it. There are many entertainment options with the FireTV. I can not sing its praises enough.
1,This kindle makes it easy to read at night.goodbuy
1,"I like the Alexa, although it is pricey. It makes choosing music and getting certain information easy. I would like some flexibility to change its name, though."
1,I enjoy it had one before It's wonderful I I read my book's on it and play games.
1,"We love the Amazon Fire. It is so easy to hook up and so easy to use.Great resource for movies, watching series and just about anything you could be interested in."
1,My wife use the echo every day and it's gotten 10 times better now that we've added the Philips Hue and Nest Thermostat in with it!
1,Like that I can send and receive e-mails and do general office work and use for pleasure and research.
1,this product does exactly what I expected it to do.loved it so much I bought two!
1,Great device can watch anything without cable box!
1,This is all you will ever need this box is fast has a usb slot so you can add space and you can use the wifi or pluge internet directly into it. This is a top end box doesnt buffer
1,I bought this online and picked it up in store. It wa Lana very easy process. The setup is extremely easy. I use Kodi on it and it works great. I used Kodi on a Firestick and there is no comparison.
1,"I find it very helpful in finding music from years ago. I also find useful in getting the weather for Downey.,California."
1,This is my second paper white and I am very satisfied
1,"I bought this item for my kid for 35$ and enjoying lot. Compared to other Tabs this is a great bargain.Pros: Its easy to use , battery is excellent works for long, even while games are being played.Strong body and very good touch sensitive.Cons: Screen resolution looks little grayish , not bright enough. which probably is good for kid eyes while playing longer."
1,Love this Gadget it's pretty amazing for adults and children very useful
1,I love my Echo! It just gets smarter and smarter! Wanting another one for upstairs.
1,I enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting. Good for reading books and web searching but Amazon App store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in Google Play or Apple App Store. Great value for the price however
1,Great for Amazon Netflix etc... Even better for more advance users Kodi!!
1,Great product for the price! This is my entertainment tablet and it is great for movies and apps. Much better than my old Nexus tablet.
1,The processor is much faster and is pretty responsive.
1,"Great beginners tablet, not too small but not that big either"
1,lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle

1,"For the low price, this tablet does the trick! Compatible with many apps such as Facebook and Kindle."
1,Need more operational info. Would appreciate your help
1,"It's great for the kids, but not intuitive with using. Took a little bit to get used to it."
1,We use this device daily. It is so easy to use and the sound is incredible. We can hear itt clearly throughout 1800 sq foot home
1,This was a gift for my daughter and her first tablet. She likes it and is Learning how to use it with the help of her son.It is easy to handle and the size is easy to carry with her.

1,Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.
1,"I love just being able to wake up in the morning and telling Alexa to play my music. So simple and amazing. That's just a beginning of what it will do. Ask anything, most of the time it's answered. Just awesome."
1,A wonderful product for those who are not on the apple hype train. Easy to use and the price was on point. Expandable memory really makes this a million times better than the baser iPads
1,"I'm so far loving this e-reader. Haven't used it outside yet, but the lighting seems really good. I'm taking it on vacation next week, it will be my lifesaver for long flights and waits. (I only wish it had a headphone jack and audio option)"
1,"Love having the Amazon Fire, are able to download apps, watch videos from Amazon Prime, and it includes profiles so kids can have access to it as well. Highly recommend!"
1,I got this for my mom who is 78. She hates it when football is on and she cant get the lottery numbers. Problem solved.
1,Went from paper white to fire for color and audio. Love the fire.
1,Item as described!!!! Excellent media center !!! Esasy to install !!!
1,"The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful"
1,I purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day as the screen on her phone was too small! She thoroughly enjoys it and uses it daily! Just what she wanted and needed!
1,We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.
1,Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for!
1,Very nice basic kindle fire. Amazon has improved the fire quite a bit.
1,My kids had one before I had got free using reward points somewhere else and it broke so replacing it. Like how these have the colored backs.
1,This is the best overall value among all Kindle readers. The built-in light feature is must-have.
1,"Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it."
1,I got it for my nephew and he very loves it.Great
1,"Have wanted some type of Kindle for quite a while, especially for reading the many free non-fiction history books I've downloaded for my genealological research. Couldn't pass up the sale price on this model and it is everything I hoped for."
1,Good charger
1,"I had previously owned one of the original Kindles, with paging buttons. It finally gave out, so I replaced it with this model. I like the ability to back-light if you want it, but it still reads beautifully in natural light just as a book. I recommend upgrading and removing ads as quick as you can."
1,I am very pleased with the paper white Kindle e reader. Love the back up light as I can read no matter what lighting I'm in. The only drawback for me is there is no text to speech. Please bring that back!!
1,The echo looks very classy and it works flawlessly and very responsive to voice commands
1,Very easy to use and can be read in direct sunlight
0,"Bought this for my Mom as a gift and was really disappointed. This device DOES NOT RUN FULL ANDROID. You cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. This device is only good if you only use Amazon (shopping, books, games), otherwise you can't download anything - not even a weather app. Not worth my money to be so limited - Returned the device and got the Lenovo Tab 2 A7 and we are MUCH happier with it!"
0,"We're an unplugged family - multiple devices (Kindles, iPads, Roku, etc.) - so we're pretty familiar with this sort of tech. Fire TV works okay, but the remote has started giving me problems and we've only had the product for about 6 months. Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy. Unless you're looking for a device that can also run Kodi, I'd strongly recommend the Roku 3 over the FireTV."
1,Tablet is great! I bought it for my 6 year old daughter again (first one finally got the screen cracked) for Christmas and she and i love it. It has all the features you would expect from an android tablet but with nice parenting aspects to keep the kids where they should be.
1,"I was looking for a box that could consolidate my many streaming services into one fast, easy to use, place. This is it. Great streaming, easy menu..... I love it."
1,This is a great product for those who have Amazon Prime as you can watch hundreds of movies free. A great addition to any TV
0,good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad
1,#NAME?
1,It's a good product I'm buy one more and another one for my room
1,Excellent price. Functions well. Added memory card for additional storage. Wonderful purchase for use as both reader and tablet!
1,I purchased this mainly for streaming tv since we canceled our cable. Works great and has a excellent selection of apps.
1,"The latest Amazon 8"" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet"
1,"This device is truly a great purchases for me, as I want something very small for a recent travel trip I went on. It made everything simple."
1,Probably one of my best purchase's for the price!!
1,"Purchased as a gift for a friend who has never owned a tablet of any kind. Great little tablet for a beginner, very good response time, for the money you really cant go wrong."
1,The scene is flawless and is fast when looking stuff up
1,Love for my Hulu Netflix Amazon prime and more... Now starz and showtime
1,"This is my second Kindle tablet and I couldn't be any happier. I primarily use my tablet to read comics, they have the best comic reader on any device to read your CBZ files (ComicCat). Now that you can upgrade and add extra memory the 50 price tag can't be beat by rival companies. Great for the kids. If they break it it's not as bad as breaking say an IPAD at a minimum of 300.00 dollars."
1,"This is a great tablet, lite, portable, exceptionally fast and plenty of space for everyday internet browsing and/or YouTube watching."
1,"My husband and I LOVE our Echo! Every morning, we listen to music, check the weather, and ask for our news update! I have found our Echo most helpful in the kitchen. It is nice being able to set a kitchen timer or change a song without having to touch a screen/timer. This is a MUST buy for any household. We are looking into turning our home into a ""smart home"". I can't to see how it works with Smart Things."
0,The constant bombardment of ads when I turn on my tablet is not an experience that I enjoy. I would recommend you buy ANY other than one that runs the Fire OS. For the same price you can get a cheap android tablet and do a lot more with it.
1,First one died within hours of setting it up. Returned and reluctantly got a second. This one has been solid.... So far.
1,My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.
0,Wasn't what I thought it would be. Not a good investment.
1,It's a perfect gift and has way more than I expected it to have.
1,I bought these for my young grandchildren (5 & 7) and they love them. They love to take pictures and make videos. They also play games on them. The battery life lasts for a long time also.
0,I thought this would be a good idea to buy my children. After I spoke with an associate at best buy and explained that I wanted this my my small children so they could play on YouTube he told me that it would work food for that. Well that was not the case I cannot ever get on you tube and my kids have not even used it after they initially tried.
1,Bought 2 of these for my adult children and they love it.
1,You can play games and watch youtube on it. I bought it for the younger ones to keep them entertained.
1,"I've been a long time user of their main competitor's products and recently purchased this to get a few e-books not available in the other vendor's catalog. The biggest difference I noticed is that this ereader defaults to having the light on at all times. I was skeptical at first, but haven't seen any problems with battery life and it actually is a little nicer to read, even in moderately lit areas."
1,Great for the price. I bought it to have access to pureflix. I'm loving it so far. Would recommend.
1,We decided to cut the cable and love the options the Fire Tv gives us.
1,"Five stars for charging It does not seem right to give a low rating to something so basic just because I returned the whole Kindle package so 5 stars for just being a charger. In full disclosure, I did not use it but have no reason to detract from it.It is a wall charging base. It charges."
1,Just as great as expected and all reviews say with simple answer easy setup
1,Amazon fire Tv Great product easy to use it's a direct plug-in to your router or Bluetooth
1,We got this tablet for our grandson. The ease of operation is definitely thumbs up.
1,"I received my new Kinkle Paperwhite! I'm an avid reader at night - sometimes well into the early morning hours. This Kindle is the best - so lightweight and you can adjust the light in the background...best of all, the print adjusts to your choice of size and style and after reading for many hours, it's great to know I can make the type larger. So lightweight you never even realize you are holding it. Love, Love, Love it. Oh, and it is very, very easy to set up."
1,Bought this for a 3 year old great for kids for games and movies
1,He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
1,"I didn't think it was possible to love my Kindle more! But I got the paper white to replace my Kindle touch. It's even more crisp and doesn't strain my eyes. Plus, I can read even when its shady or dark- because of the backlight. I like that I can adjust the brightness too. Worth every penny ! LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Highly recommend."
1,This device is quite delightful.The interractions can be fun.
1,Best electronic device purchased in a long time. Nice to be able give commands without getting out of your bed/chair
1,"I ended up buying the Echo on sale. I was thrilled once Alexa was set up, which by the way is easy. I just bought another one on sale and gave it as a gift. A must have for sure if you like technology, Alexa is helpful and a lot of fun."
1,The best way to read a lot of e-books from any kind to a great price!!
1,"Amazon Fire TV is a great streaming box, easy to set up and use."
1,Pretty good tablet. Keeps the kids interested which is Why I brought it.
1,These are a great tool to have at home or office. I would highly recommend for anyone. Simple and easy to use.
1,It is slick and a little hard to hold; otherwise it's great.
1,"My nephew loved this for Christmas. He can now read, surf the web, play games, watch movies all on his kindle fire. Definitely an aunt win!"
1,"When I purchased the Kindle, I was doing a lot of travel. It was great having access to material that had been downloaded prior to leaving.Great item for all ages."
1,"My sales person was excellent. She knew the product and was able to answer all of my questions. I bought a kindle paperwhite. I had the geek squad to synk it to my laptop. ""I love those guys"""
1,It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
1,It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.
1,This is one of the best presents ever. Can control the entire house with your voice.
0,The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
1,Having this beats paying the high cable and satellite prices.
1,My son bought this and he loves it. And it's cheap!
1,"Great tablet for Facebook, email, games and surfing the internet. Easy to set up."
1,Wanted a decent tablet for my teenage daughter without spending a lot. Other then the ads on the lock screen the tablet is perfect for her needs. You can remove the ads which to me is worth it.
1,My son loves this tablet for apps & games. Its perfect for kids & includes the ability to read which is great. Great price!
1,"It works as expected. Voice commands work fairly well. Everyone in the family enjoys talking to it. The search engine that Alexa uses isn't terribly useful. However, we use it to stream a variety of radio stations and other audio. Hopefully down the road we will be incorporating it more into our daily life."
1,This product needs a bit more info to explain how it works and the set up. It is all quite easy once we had a neighbor over to help and ro explain. We are still exploring how this works for us but so far it is almost too good to be true -- especially with the price!We are hooked on 'the night manager'
1,"Got this case for my daughter's Fire. Solid build and good function. Using it as a fold out stand is a little quirky but I wasn't looking to use it for that anyway. Not sure about the overall protection, but hey - it's for a very cheap tablet."
1,This is so fun and easy to use. Alexa knows everything! So crazy!
1,I have an iPad pro and I read in a kindle. The best reading experience and no distractions. Use it several times a day!
0,Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.
1,I bought this item as an alternative for Netflix and I got rid of Netflix as soon as I got it. Amazing product.
1,Works very good with all my streaming apps and some gaming apps
1,"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great."
0,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it."
1,It was a great price bought it for my neiece for Christmas and I'm sure she is going to love it.
1,"Easy to use, easy apps and books, you can use a timer to schedule time use"
1,"I'm pretty happy with this, just takes a little bit of time to figure out were everything is at."
1,This device is user friendly. It is easily transported. There are many wonderful apps to choose from. The price is fabulous!A great gift for Santa to bring!!!!!
1,Google Alexa questions for a good time. Very good speaker quality and decent volume.
1,Love my Fire TV. Very user friendly and I love the remote.
1,It's a great little tablet with good features but isn't worth getting h less you have Amazon prime.
1,Love it. Great price. Great features. Easy to set up and can just use double side tape to hide right behind tv.
1,The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
1,My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
0,"This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
1,Love this new addition. The light feature really helps
1,"It's a great value for the price, just know you don't have the same freedoms with a normal Android tablet because this runs FireOS. The battery life is good. The screen isn't the best but hey it's a bargain for kids or just using as a e-reader."
1,"Love the parental controls and more storage than previous models, but still seems to run out."
0,this was given as a gift and recipient happy with it.
1,Great tablet great screen built well responds well
1,Good Black Friday deal...Wife enjoys it for reading
1,This is a great little tablet for the younger generation.
1,"I went back and forth for quite some time about purchasing the Echo. I watched many YouTube videos and reviews as well as reading a lot about the product itself. I finally caught it on sale and used to gift cards to buy it despite protests from my wife. I have to say Alexa is pretty intuitive and has no issues recognizing my voice. There are times when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance. Amazon has done a great job updating the Echo weekly and adding relevant skills such as package tracking and even flight status. I use it mostly for news, weather, shopping lists, reminders, movie times, timers, and occasionally some music. If you have any smart appliances then controlling them with Alexa is really cool. I only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask Alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark, just ask Alexa to turn the light off once u are there. As long as it is a reasonable distance of course. I admit it is a bit pricey so one should really look at their possible uses because I could see the novelty wearing off for some but for me it is a keeper."
1,"My old tablet had froze up on me, I was vacationing and I needed a new tablet, so I went to Best Buy and bought the Fire, easy to use and reasonably priced."
1,4k on Fire if you want a 4k streaming with Amazon.
1,"Great device for tv show, movies, and supports 4k."
1,The Kindle is great for taking on a plane trip or just having something to read while you're waiting in the doctor's office. And there's a great selection of books online.
1,This box is fantastic. It is much faster than most of the other ones out there and you can't beat the price.
1,"Great tablet for the kids, play games, surf the web, AWESOME , 5 STARS !!!"
1,"We recently cut out our satellite service and switched to the Amazon fire TV...we haven't looked back. Very fast, easy to install, and very compact. I do recommend getting the one with the voice command, it's very convenient. The only thing is to just make sure your wifi internet is up to date and fast."
1,Great gift for those who read and also enjoy Youtube
1,Amazon echo is a nice buy but needs to be fine tuned a bit.
1,My son loves this tablet and it was an amazing Black Friday deal!
1,"Echo is a great companion. Without fail brings a smile to our face when we say ""Good night, Good morning, Tell me a joke, or How did the Lakers do last night?"""
1,"Easy to set it up, and it's paying for itself because I'm cancelling some cable channels"
1,I enjoy that I can use Alexa and take it around with me. Especially being able to listen to music anywhere I want.
1,This was a replacement for a previous Fire. My wife loves it and the Fire does what she needs
1,Purchased this to replace my original Kindle Fire (which still works but no longer updates and can't use newer apps). It's a great bargain. Perfect size for reading and browsing the web.
1,This thing in unbelievable.. Why did I wait so long to buy!??
1,"This product has been so thoroughly reviewed that I won't repeat the obvious in any detail. It's great for reading under all conditions -- sharp typefaces and, of course, illuminated. Two small issues: 1. in dim light conditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven. There are slightly darker areas just above each of the four lights that illuminate the screen. This does not bother me and it isn't noticeable in a brightly lit environment. More annoying is the fact that the Search function doesn't work with some books: for those, searching brings up no results, no matter what I enter. I have the same books on my Kindle Keyboard and have to use that to find what I'm looking for. I haven't contacted Amazon about this, but it seems odd. On other books, it works as expected. One other thing to keep in mind if you have an older Kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently, given that it's illuminated. Overall, I like this reader as the display is excellent, it's easy to hold, and page-turn and other navigation features all work well. If it weren't for the problem with searching, I'd give it five stars."
1,No worries with this tablet. It's easy to work and has all the functionality of the big boys.
1,I bought it for reading books. And it works very well for that purpose.
1,It gives me viewing options that I love and the grand kids love playing the games
1,Easy to set up and connects without issues. Add a few wifi switches and skills and you have a voice activated smart house. Plus you can talk to Alexa and not feel lonely.
1,I got this only because the next best (full android tv) is the nvidia shield which is a little out of my price range. Amazon blocks alot of the native android features and hides some apps that are generally available in the android play store. Other than that it's a great streaming device
1,I like this tablet it's very low maintenance and is easy
1,Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
1,I have to say I have enjoyed this over many droid boxes and I think it's easier to use. It has gotten locked up a few times and I had to unplug it to have it do a hard restart. Other then that I have to say for the price it's a good product
1,I love this table because I can monitor everything my kids download!!! Watch!!! Use!!!! I can control everything!!! Best investment!!!
1,Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
1,My wife and kids love that Alexa can help with spelling and a multitude of questions. Links to music and we really enjoy the drop in feature.
1,"I've had the Echo for several months and love it. The sound is excellent, the device recognizes my voice from across the room, and it's handy to use."
1,"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!"
1,good buy
0,This is a good product the resolution is clear and very pretty. Glad I bought it.
1,Love this! Always messing around and asking it questions
1,Great tablet for simple surfing and reading. Serves it purpose!!
1,My Fire Tv device is very handy and actually have 2 of them and am thinking about getting my 3rd one.
1,Small with a lot of sound. It works perfect in my home
0,"NO connection to WIFI, Nook Color, HD+ work on it."
1,Great price for product. It's get of you have kids.
1,"Is very good, I like, I recommend this product, I recommend, I recommend"
1,Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.
1,Love my echo.. after work relaxing listening to music having a glass.. its a keeper
1,Ok for basics a little slow...great for price a good idea for kids and browsing
1,"Excellent product. My grandson loves it. Fast, easy to use and yet challenging enough that he is learning at the same time"
1,"Bought for my grandchildren,easy for them to use, Great downloads for kids,they love the easy to use camera.Great prices.The book downloads for them to read.I highly recommend this product,for anyone who has children!"
1,"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
1,"The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it"
1,"From soup to nuts, daylight to dark, start to finish. Echo has got you covered."
1,Work as expected Would recommend to a friend good product
1,This is a great stab at voice control. Speaker is not top notch
1,One of the best tablets on the market for its value
1,The Kindle Fire is a great tablet. It satisfies my needs.
0,This is an average performance tablet and amazon centric. This tablet could have been better if amazon would have made it with android os instead of poorly designed fire OS. The app store and apps in that are not great. This tablet can be good for people who wants to read while travel or play some games while travel will be good. I paid only 35$ so cant complain for the price i paid. I already have ipad mini 2 and comparing with that makes this tablet little slow.
1,I had it for two months and I start loving to read.
1,Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.
1,My son loves how easy it is to navigate through the apps
1,"Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable"
1,"Bought this a a gift for my wife, who loves to read, but who has absolutely no use for or interest in information technology and the tools of that trade. She can barely tolerate email, and refuses to interact with a smartphone. Once introduced to Kindle, however, she has become hooked. It is light, easy to carry, seldom needs to be charged, turns pages with a touch, and is a veritable portable library.It was an inspired gift - and who knows where it might lead."
1,"The lighting of the Paperwhite did not present any issues with glare - easy on eyes, even while wearing sunglasses outdoors."
1,"They keep busy, lots of kids apps to view!! Entertainig"
1,Bought two...one for each kid for Christmas. Perfect for the kids. Download their shows and music. Keeps them off ours. Durable enough for them to use on their own.
1,"And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
1,"My 2 grandsons, ages 9 and 11, had to share a kindle which often left the 9 year old out. Now they can play games with each other on their kindles. Things are quieter now."
1,Its very fast and offers 4k video. Allows you to download 3rd party software to the device. Can't beat it.
1,WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE!
1,Not yet sure all it can do but love that I can just ask for the weather or ask it to play music by a particular artist. Fun to work with.
1,The Amazon echo is worth it just for playing music. You can play pandora or Amazon prime music. But it's much more from setting a timer to adding items to my shopping list. Alexa answers your questions better than any device. And totally hands free
0,"I bought this to use only one application. Oh, is it most difficult to get this thing to continuously work! And I still can't get the geek squad program to properly download onto the device. I'm pretty disappointed."
1,"We have so much fun using the echo almost everyday. We don't give command to echo, we talk to her (yes, echo is not an IT)."
1,"My husband wanted a tablet, mostly for reading books. He had looked at some but hadn't purchased one. I went online and read reviews and picked this one. He has been so pleased and uses it all the time."
1,Love product connects to my Nest thermostat and wink products without any problem
0,"I got this because I didn't want to set another cable box in my room. I don't watch a lot of tv to begin with. What I like about the fire tv is that you can download apps such as the Uverse app from att and watch live tv from it. And other apps like history channel, Netflix, food channel. You can also buy an app that lets you connect your smart phone to the tv. So if you have a movie on your phone or laptop that the fire tv doesn't have, you can connect it and mirror it and it will appear on your tv. Almost as having a cable box but you only pay once and not every month for it. The control does get disconnected a lot, I don't know if it's the Amazon batteries or if it's the remote. Over its good for someone who doesn't watch a lot of tv."
1,My wife and I really like this device. We also bought the smaller version to put in our bedroom to play music and nature sounds to go to sleep to. We don't really do a lot with the USB/BlueTooth yet though.
1,This is my second kindle. I think I overloaded the old one. My only complaint is my old cases don't work on it. Guess I'll just have to buy new!
1,I love my amazon fire .I use it everyday.best item I ever bought..everyone should have one.
1,"I have only had it for 2 days now but have played games, set up my email and figured out how to read books on it. It seems very responsive and I have begun learning the all the finger moves to run it."
1,"The product has limitless possibilities with wireless communication between lights, thermostats, and locks if desired."
0,"Each time that the Kindle Fire needs to be unlocked, an advertisement pops up on the screen. To remove these ads cost an additional fee, so be aware that this is the case. I have owned Nooks previously and they were more flexible in usage - such as being able to read epub books easily, for example."
1,Met all my expectations and the Alexa app is pretty cool.
1,"For the longest time, I was using my phone to store a few books to read when I have the time. But it came to the point that my battery was suffering from this. What I love about the Paperwhite is the battery life, about 8 weeks. In addition to that, you can turn down the brightness to the point that it looks like an actual page, so its actually better for your eyes. I have about 300 books on my paperwhite so I am beyond satisfied. Definitely worth the $."
1,We all love his thing. Had the google home and returned it out of frustration and in favor of the echo. Eye happy
1,"This purchase by far has been one of the best made by me this year. Set up was easy, and the content was plentiful. Well worth the price."
0,Every time it was turned on and Every time I went to the Internet I had advertisement. If I'm going to pay money for something I certainly don't want advertisement along with it. If it were free okay fine advertise to me.The advertisement could not be shut off. I returned it.
1,My husband bought a Paperwhite for himself a few months ago but at the time I turned down his offer to buy one for me as well thinking I would continue to read on my tablet. However when we spent time reading and relaxing in the yard I became jealous that he could read his scree so easily while I struggled to see mine at all. In the end I caved and let him buy one for me as well and I love it. It's neat and small and light weight and easy to hold and the battery lasts more than a week.
1,I bought this tablet for my son and he enjoys using it the only thing I don't love is that u need internet to use most apps on it and you cant download youtube kids. It has a lot of apps though and a lot of learning material for all ages.
1,This tablet I use for reading as well as free games.
1,"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle."
1,the tablet works just like my laptop quick& fast .
1,"My family has been enjoying Amazon stuff more lately, and the Kindle Fire Tablet is no exception! I haven't spent enough time on it to get what I need as efficiently as I can on my Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1, but my husband prefers it to his Galaxy tab 8 (currently in use by our 10-yr-old son). Remotes are too complicated sometimes... our family joke anyway... but he'll sit down and browse the Amazon content, get all the car stuff he enjoys reading, and I haven't heard a complaint or call for help. I haven't even heard any annoyed-caveman sounds! I like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet. May sound trivial, but my main complaint with both Galaxy tabs is that the inputs are on the bottom, so they can't sit upright for use while being charged (bottom-portrait for the tab 8 and bottom-landscape for the tab 10.1 - either way, it hinders function). Functionality during charging isn't disturbed with the Fire tablet. When I'm ready for a new tablet, I'll probably get the Galaxy Pro because it seems friendlier for bloggers, writers, etc. but the Kindle works if you're not looking for something too complicated. Price-point is great too."
1,"I enjoy the Kindle very much, as it is so convenient and easy to use. I like the white background, easy to see."
1,I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!!
1,Use it for required school work and educational apps for elementary and middle school students
1,Amazon products are always good as expected. And I am totally satisfied with my purchase.
1,"very easy to set up and use.... no eye strain, very easy to read on"
1,I bought this for my ten year old daughter. This is so much better than carringing around a bunch of heavy books. The battery also lasts forever
1,fun to play with ask questions get weather traffic reports or listen to music
1,"I extremely enjoy and like my Kindle Voyage Reader a whole bunch! I like reading on it a whole bunch, especially my Living Bible, because I'm a Christian that loves God and Jesus Christ of Nazareth! I believe this product is a very excellent reader, which a person can read all of their books on the Kindle Voyages in their Amazon library! Definitely get one today, because especially, because it is light weight and has an awesome back light for reading in the dark. I like it because it is so light and easy on the arms while holding while reading. God bless you! :)"
1,This product is a great addition to our house and for the entire family. Placing us further in the technology driven world
1,this item is a great upgrade from my last kindle.everything is touch screen and is faster than before
1,I bought this for my husband who just turned 87 and isn't up to date on technology I thought it would be fun to have a direct line to knowledge with voice command
1,Excellent for browsing and reading. Good price for great quality.
1,I wanted a reliable tablet for my 8 year old son. This one was recommended to me after another tablet had charging issues. This has functioned well since purchase.
1,Bought this for my niece as her first tablet. She was so excited!!
1,Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable
1,You really can't get much better than a Kindle for reading ebooks. The Paperwhite is great as it has a touchscreen and has a backlight for reading in just about any environment.
1,I love my amazon fire tv. I canceled my directv and replaced it with the fire tv. I saved $165.00/ month.
1,"The tablet its self seem a little slow. But for the price and it being got my kids, totally acceptable"
1,"This is my second Echo along with a couple of Dots. I use them for Home Automation, music and basic information at hand. Every home should have an Amazon Echo."
0,"All in all it is pretty cool but seems pretty limited to me. Gets annoying when you constantly have to access SPotify before asking for an artist or it defaults to Amazon free previews...but I get it. Wish it could answer more questions but assume that will come with time, updates or future models. Feels like one of those technological offerings that you try and fit into your life versus one that naturally fills a void."
1,It's a really good tablet for the price. I was amazed! If you're on with the amazon app store(aka underground) then you'll love this tablet.
1,It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy
1,"My wife and I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help keep her entertained during car rides, etc.. well now she is completed addicted to it. I guess like many kids get addicted to their electronics. We just set limits to how often and when she can use it. There are also educational games and apps you can down load that help them to learn and prepare for school. My daughter loves playing these games also. Overall a great purchase."
1,"I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up."
1,a good plug
1,"For $35 you can't go wrong, even at the reg price of $50 I would recommend this to anyone. Does everything I need it to and more. Web surfing, emails and books all at your fingertips. The ability to download games, etc is just an added bonus. Prime is not needed but works great if you have it. I am forgoing the purchase of a case, because at $50 I could just buy a new tablet if anything ever happened to this one. Thanks amazon!"
1,Better than the firestick because it has more memory and also has Ethernet port so you can plug directly into box for faster results.
1,love it....very nice...really easy to navigate and it has a lot of things. Control remote easy to operate
1,This is a great tablet. Great for the price. Very fast and easy to use.
1,"The Echo was originally purchased as a gift for my wife and I. That did not work well as I have not seen it since. My wife uses it to get ready in the morning. She loves to ask her the weather so she knows how to dress and loves to have her play music as she gets ready. All without going to her computer. She can also asks for store hours and phone numbers. She seldom is interested in technology, but has told me that I can purchase another one for me. Yes!!!"
1,I purchased this to watch Amazon Prime programing and Playstation Vue.This is way faster than the Fire Stick. Although I still have occasional glitches I can't for sure say its from the Fire TV versus the services.
1,"I wanted the one with whispersync but none were available, so for the cost and having familiar ebook I purchased this unit. Great for taking to poolside or beach when on vacation."
1,"Powerful little tablet. Wish it had more apps available, but for the price, you can't beat it."
1,I bought this for myself to have but once my kids got a hold on it was there's. Great tablet for a great price. All you need is a good wifi and enjoy.
1,I'm enjoying my new kindle paperwhite so far. Everything is perfect.
1,The Amazon fire TV is an excellent addition to our household entertainment setup! The ease of use is appreciated and the show content is perfect for my needs.
1,even my luddite spouse loves it. Easy to use. Read in full sunlight.
1,This is a good all around tablet for a nice price. I have one for me and one for my seven year old and haven't regretted it. I suggest it if you have Prime and love tech.Only con is the cameras which are a bit grainy but I use a phone for pics
1,Although it looks like a tall can it's much more it a talking can
1,I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!!
1,I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
1,Love the Fire! Great for everything I need! Great screen and clear picture!
1,I purchased several of these for gifts. Everyone loved them. Works great and easy to use.
1,"There are not many questions you can inquire of Alexa and not get an answer. You do have to precise in the wording of your question. And you always have to start with ""Alexa"". Decent speaker and you can do Prime Music.The beginning of AI!?!?"
0,"Love the product, not happy that there have been two sales on it at Best Buy. One 18 days after purchase $50 off, today 23 days after purchase online $80 off. They won't help me, after 15 days I was told!"
1,Has an efficient battery and works well. I've had every Kindle since the second generation and it is my favorite to date. I love the Amazon distressed leather cover.
1,"I was resistant to buying an Amazon Fire because I thought my smart TV and cable box were doing a great job. However now that I've tried it, I'm planning to add one to the other 4 tv's in the house. It's seamless and so fast, and the ability to just talk to the remote instead of typing is AWESOME! We constantly use it now for streaming Amazon, Netflix, HBO, YouTube, and more. Seriously thinking about cutting cable TV out of our budget altogether."
1,Bought one last year that worked out well. Decided to get another one this year. Very pleased.
1,this is easy to setup even for the wife. 9 year old son is a wiz at this already.
1,"I purchased as a replacement E-Reader to my Alurek. I could not download E-books on to my new MacBook and do not want to read books on my MacBook. I love the size, feel and back light of the Paper White. Glad I purchased it."
1,"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound. AI app Alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches. Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,"
1,The child that this item was purchased for hasn't put it down. He is really enjoying it!
1,This is the best way to go if your sick of cable bills. Movies galore on this.
1,"Not the fastest for loading web pages, but apps run smoothly. I've noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory, so delete some apps if you cannot access wi-fi. Great for Netflix, Flixter and games. Good resolution, just short of HD, but can tell the difference if HD is chosen over SD when given the choice while watching movies."
1,Easy to use. Memory fills up fast though. Battery life is decent.
1,I'm very tough on dishwashers and this one seems to be up to the challenge! I will never own another brand!
1,"This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me."
1,"Lightweight, bright screen, adequate capacity, great battery life. The perfect stand alone eReader."
1,"The box was well protected and shipping was on time, very satified"
1,Got 2 of these for my grandsons and they love them.
1,He loves it. Using it with the Amazon Free Time app. Son uses is constantly. Easy to set up and use. Easy to keep kids from making purchases or accessing content outside of the Free Time app.
1,"After years of not reading books, after the Kindle I read daily, the adjustable type size is a big help for old folks like myself :)"
1,This is my second fire reader. I like how compact it is and also that can add sim card which I have. Only negative is I wish the battery life was a little better.
1,Great product for my seven year old granddaughter.
1,I have a sounds system to hookup the dot to so i bought this one as a gift for my father. He loves it and learns new things to use it for everyday
1,"Love me some Alexa., Im looking forward to better software updates that come in daily. Speaker is good, just looking forward to the new stuff"
1,Shipped fast. Easy setup. Works great. Would definitely recommend.
1,Awesome for the price and great for the kids when you are traveling
0,We decided to buy the amazon tabs due to the great price on black Friday. We returned them.
1,I got this during black Friday for a great price. I know this is essentially their older tablet but it still has a decent processor and has a micro SD slot for cheap expandable storage.In short it runs great and I set up a child's profile for my son so he can play the apps we added for him and don't have to worry about him running up charges etc because of the child profile.
1,"Tap is a portable Amazon Echo with speakers. Great for carrying to basement or upstairs. Works like echo but not voice activated, you must ""tap"" it before talking."
1,"I miss some of the features that my Nook E-ink had; specifically the home key. However, this has served me well so far, and the backlight is a nice feature."
1,Buy this one instead of the fire stick if you want an Ethernet connection. With my internet it runs flawlessly. Great product. Purchasing 2 more for other tvs.
1,I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.
1,I bought this for my family for Christmas. It is wonderful.
1,Very easy to read and great back lighting. Discounted price was a pleasant surprise.
1,This is great for streaming Plex to tv's. No hassle perfect quality for a fire stick
1,"Wasn't really sure of all of the capabilities and applications for the Echo, and I am still discovering them, but after a week or so I am happy with the product. Easy initial setup, easy access to my home WiFi, Amazon account, and google account. I have already used it to set timers and reminders and re-order past Amazon purchases. All easy-peasy lemon squeezy"
1,Need a replacement for my son and this tablet Is great .
1,Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price
1,This amazon product has met all of my expectations! Great product!!
1,"New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet."
1,My daughter is really enjoying her new Kindle that was purchased as a Christmas present.
1,it is good product.i like best buy.Excellent service.
1,excellent value for the price. Tablet works well for my 9 year old!
1,"It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games."
1,It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
1,"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Great product
1,Bought this tablet on Black Friday for a little bit of a deal and it was too good to pass up. I don't use it as much as I thought I would but it's still really fun and easy to use. There is an advertisement on the lock screen but I'm willing to deal with it for the price. Battery life lasts a while and it's fairly easy to use and understand.
1,Our kids even enjoy using the Echo. It's been very entertaining for our family. We do get more music preferences with Amazon Prime membership.
1,I really like my Kindle Fire. Just make sure that when you get a free month of Amazon Prime that you cancel it before it expires otherwise you will be charged over $100.
1,Set up is easy and works well from the start. Will purchase another for the extra room
1,"I think this is a great product/ solution, especially for the price. I needed to replace my portable DVD player. I have 2 young kids and still wanted something to play movies on the planes and during car trips. After looking at my options I decided on getting them both a Kindle for about the same price of 1 DVD player. HEADS UP: The Disney Anywhere app takes some work to download the movies on the kindle but there is a way. You have to access it through Amazon movies in order to download them. I got a MicroSD card to store the movies on and so far so good! They held up, supplied games, movies and when there is Wi-Fi they can play ABCMouse to get some learning in there too. Great buy. Good luck getting those movies downloaded :)"
1,"Works great, easy hook up. .competitive price. very satisfied."
1,This is the third kindle fire that I have purchased so it is obvious that we absolutely love them. Now all three grandsons have one and they are on them constantly. Excellent gift for any age.
1,I just love this new cover. It protects my kindle and it's easy to put into coat pockets if needed. The colors that matches the kindles are really cool. I don't trust anything else to protect my kindle.
1,Very easy to read and the backlight adds to it and does not hurt the battery time much.
1,Love my echo without it Ill die it helps me with my appointments .
1,"Bought two of them as gifts for parents, arrived on time, satisfied and great for what you pay"
1,Love it. You can read without diestraftions of notifications as you would from your phone.
1,The kindle is light and easy to use. Was able to get up and running within 10 minutes. Easy to charge. Programs are easy to view for older eyes. Perfect starter technology for the no tech generation.
1,"A bit slow for some games, but for general browsing and reading it is more than satisfactory. I think it is great for its designed purpose"
1,Easy to use. No more fumbling for lite switches in the dark
1,My husband and I each own this Kindle. You will never find us without them at hand for gaming or email. My bff always complained that I was addicted. Guess what I got herfor a birthday present! So who's the addict now!
1,Charges incredibly fast. Definitely worth it. I use it for my phone too.
1,"So far have enjoyed using the device. Have not found a serious application for it yet, but enjoy what we have tried so far."
1,It is very useful and I am learning new things everyday
1,I really like the bigger screen the only downside is it takes a lot of power so the battery wears out faster than the smaller kindle
1,I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,"What a fun toy this is! It was easy to learn to use, and If I needed help, the online User's Guide is right there. Purchasing books couldn't be easier, and there's no ""hard copy"" to dispose of when you'e done. I was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort. With so many low-cost or no-cost books, as well as current best sellers, there's an endless number to choose from. You can use the search function to search by topic or title. I like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that. I know I will enjoy my Kindle Voyage for a long time."
1,I recently received a kindle paper white as a gift from my wife. I love it!
1,"Purchased for a child as a first tablet. Coupled with the price, it's a good introductory option for streaming media and playing games."
1,The Echo is in our kitchen and is a great device for listening to songs. The wife loves it and the kid likes to ask it questions about all kinds of different subjects. Got it on sale and for the price I could not pass it up. It was a great buy and very fun to have around.
1,Buy this and load some software and you're set... Watch anything from sports to movies to tv shows...It's great!!!
1,"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
1,This tablet is a great back up tablet for the money............
1,Can't complain about a very inexpensive tablet. Got it on black Friday for a great price. Works great
1,Best E reader i have owned yet. Definitely worth the money
1,This is a fantastic pad for anyone my absolute favorite sturdy access so easy and I will always give it 5 stars!
1,"Faster than the fire stick and more memory, so less maintenance. I would of given 5 stars, but you have to buy a hdmi cable unlike the stick which just plugs in."
1,Bought for my grandma and she loves it. Very easy and simple to use.
1,This is the best kindle yet. Very sharp text and easy page management.
1,Pretty good sound for a mono speaker. Hears us clearly from many feet away. Use it to stream music from Pandora. Actually love this thing. We linked a really good blue tooth speaker to it and the sound is great. Be aware that you can only link one other blue tooth device to the Echo.
1,I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
1,These kindles are the perfect gift for kids (and adults) of all ages! Everybody in my family owns one and we use them daily!
1,Great system gives great Television alternatives for people of all kinds
1,This is a great tablet. I bought several for gifts. Best Buy had the best price. I only gave four stars because of all the ads preloaded to these tablets is a pain.
1,I highly recommenf the new Paperwhite kindle. Such great reading anywhere!!!
1,I love my new Panasonic phone system. It has 2 handsets which is a good idea for those living with family! I also like the ease of operating the answering machine as well. Thank you Best Buy!
1,Working as expected
1,"Wonderful product!! User friendly and if help is needed, online support is available."
1,Good upgrade from the basic kindle that I had before.
1,The paper white is easy to use and the built in light is great.
1,"This product is so fancy, neat, and fun to use! HOw could you not pass this up to purchase!"
1,"As usual, Amazon does a great job of making the Kindle - this was for my wife and replaced her previous Kindle. Awesome product."
1,I love my new kindle. It's very slim and easy to use!
1,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats"
1,"Easy to use, you just plug it in the outlet. Anyone can figure it out."
1,It does a lot of things as well as a more expensive tablet so it's strong for the money spent
1,I have the 1st gen fire and love it so I purchased this for my grandson as I know it's qualities and durability. He loves it and with the kid friendly underground free apps makes it all the more great. The camera? Not so much. Overall great tablet for the price!
1,Nice size and easy to use and handy to take along with you.
0,Good product for the money. Compared to earlier versions not as durable. The outside casing is plastic. Not good. For the money good buy.
1,"Amazing the knowledge it has, Music so crystal clear."
1,I use the echo to control the lights and thermostat in the house. Syncs with other devices really easy and has a ton of other function.
1,"read most of the reviews. didn't see anything about ads or I may have been blinded on how cheap it was. there are ads at the lock screen and the pop ups from free apps. the several apps I have download would always pop up. got me annoyed so I returned it. besides that it is pretty smooth operating, smoother than galaxy tab A."
0,"This Amazon Fire is fine for just reading and minimal research and investigative work. Apart from e-reading, it is slow and unresponsive."
1,I absolutely LOVE the Kindle Paperwhite. The battery life is great - reading a half hour to an hour a day it lasts 2-3 weeks. Screen backlight is very easy on the eyes and adjustable in brightness. This is one of my best tech purchases.
1,It's a lot of fun to play with. He artificial intelligence is good. It makes things easy to do.
1,Great birthday gift for a 9 year old. He has enjoyed this so much.
1,It's an ok product. Use it mainly for Bluetooth speaker. Get sports updates. I isn't a bad product.
1,"Love, love, love this! Compact, convenient, great lighting, lightweight."
1,Ordered multiple products. Both are great. One I have purchased before.
1,"My kids love this little fire, they can watch whatever movies for number of times wi"
0,"We switched from an older model tablet to this simplified Kindle Fire. For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader. Being Amazon Prime customers, we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on Kindle platform."
1,Great product for your money. Excellent quality and features
1,"Alexa does so many things like play music, give you news updates, control your Amazon account....etc.So simple to setup and use. It's a wonderful device that is useful and fun for whole family."
1,Very good and best for travel readings. I really like it and would like to refer with all
1,"Being the best husband I can be, after hearing the wife say she would like a Kindle, did some research and saw that the PaperWhite would be perfect for her reading habits."
1,I am using it for my 3 year old and she loves it..
1,Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.
1,Bought it for this Thanksgiving and for a decent price. Works decently and kids live this.
1,"I love this little device. It's perfect for reading anywhere and anytime, especially great to use in the dark after my hubby is asleep. Most back lit devices hurt my eyes by this one doesn't bother them at all."
1,"We are really enjoying all the benefits of having Alexa. She greets us every morning with a fun fact, news, weather, devotion, reads kids a book. In the evening, she turns the lights out & plays a medley of songs to sleep. We love Prime membership & all the great things it adds to Alexa.And now read she will be added to Apple iPhone.We will be buying more for other floors of our home. The speakers' quality is also very good! We highly recommend you buy one or more."
0,If you are buying it is a great price. To buy for you kids . They should come with a case for same price.
1,i really like this product bought it as a gift for kids
0,Currently enjoying the learning experience. We have not dived whole-heartedly into the many channel options
0,Got this on sale for 35 bucks I think. My I phone is faster and works better on most things but couldn't beat the price. Serve its purpose for occasional use and games.
0,Good for kids just wanting to play games or watch movies. Even when purchasing extra gb storage cards.
1,"Bought this for a friend she loved it! She always wanted a kindle for reading coz she is an ""electronic worm"". I am glad she loved it"
1,"Got this vs the fire stick because of the wired connection, voice command remote, and netflix in 4K. It was a hands down, no brainer; it does what I need!"
1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and he absolutely loves it, he continues to enjoy reading while at home or traveling!"
1,"Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around"
1,This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.
1,This is a great tablet. It is reasonably priced and has great quality.
1,grand son said he liked it .that it was fun to play with. he could do what he needed to do with it. glad he is happy with it.
1,"Bought for Grandchildren, they loved it. We downloaded videos from vacation for them."
1,Picture is great & for the price it's more than I expected my son loves it.
1,"The Kindle Fire 7"" so far works well after about 6 weeks of daily use. The battery life is a bit disappointing - four hours or less. I bought this to replace my Kindle e-reader because it was for sale at a very good price. But, it functions much better as a basic tablet. I don't like reading for long periods with this screen. Sad to see my keyboard e-reader die, but these electronics don't last forever."
1,I've been using a Kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a Birthday present. Very excited recipient!
1,Parents really like it for a bluetooth speaker and informational guide in their small condo. Great buy!
1,It was a great purchase and I love the way it works
1,"Great tablet for a little kid. I was debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet. Its nice because you can switch users. If you want something simple , then this is the one for you."
1,"I love this product, I have one Echo and 3 Dots in my home and they work perfect with my smart home hubs and other products. I highly recommend this product."
0,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
1,It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..
1,The Echo is amazing and very quick with every question you throw at her.
1,I bought 2 of these tablets for my Grandsons that both have Autism. They can be very hard on things and this is 1 tablet neither boy has been able to break yet. they are very easy for them to use and they LOVE them. The only thing with them is you need an Amazon account for them.
1,"I love the kindle. I have had 4 versions now. (None of them broke down, I just upgraded) The new one has more storage space and handles everything I want to do. It is the perfect size and easy to carry. The Fire products are just a great deal."
1,"Like using it to play music, answering questions, playing favorite radio stations, setting timers in kitchen, telling jokes. Apps for games are few. Questions to Alexa must be exactly worded or she does not understand the question."
1,My friends kids loved them. Perfect for kids 6 and up. Would def. recommend
1,Absolutely love it! Watch movies all the time. Great investment!
1,Great battery life and easy to navigate!!! Great value!
1,Gave as Xmas gifts and received very positive responses.
1,Very helpful to use around the house and kids love to use too.
1,"Great price and tablet. Kid friendly, good parental controls, works very well!"
1,"How can you go wrong? $40 for a tablet that you can use as an E-reader, to check social media, to play games on? Small enough to fit in your purse? Surf the web? And it's pretty fast. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for an affordable tablet to use for basic things or for children who are rough on their toys. I plan to buy one of these for my mother who has an older iPad that is awfully slow."
1,"Wonderful product, very easy set up. Set it up with smart light switches."
1,Surprised my son-in-law with the Echo. Such a great gift for everyone who loves gadgets and technology.
1,It's a great tool for family entertainment. Lots of things to explore.
1,How can you go wrong with a 35.00 tablet on black Friday deals.I should of bought more when I had the chance
1,This is a fun tool to have for the family. It does make easier to have prime on Amazon to listen to music.
1,"Recently purchased this amazon fire box. I am still learning how to work everything. I am enjoying it so far. You do have to have a Netflix account and alot of the other applications to use alot of things. However, their is a work around for everything lol. I will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the cord also."
1,"I had the Fire Stick, but upgraded to the Fire TV so run Kodi. Works great"
1,"I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi."
1,"Good product, easy to set up and to use! I purchased it to have DTV Now on a 2nd tv and I received a Apple box from DTV , I like the Amazon box better than the Apple box , more user friendly."
1,My granddaughter has the kids version so I purchased this one for an older nephew and he lives this kindle.
1,Bought this as a gift for my wife. She uses it mostly in place of her old black & white Kindle...mama is happy...so I am happy...
1,Haven't personally used this tablet but my niece likes it.
1,You can pay a nominal monthly fee for Alexa to play tons of music. I also have it set up for Alexa to control all the lighting in the house. Works great.
1,"Fun for the whole family. Alexia tells funny jokes for kids, answers questions on almost every subject and provides lots of musical choices."
1,I love the ease of alexa. My mom lives with me and she does understand how to use iTunes on her ipad... but she van ask Alexa to play any music she wants to hear.
0,Takes a bit to get used to OS but once you do it is a pretty decent tab for 40 bucks.
1,"It's fun to be able to play music, control the temperature, and ask questions to a box on a credenza... But it's missing one key integration... Control of the fire stick!"
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping, for electronics bestbuy is number one."
1,I got it for my kids and they love it they play with it every day
1,I bought this product for my father. He's loves it. It's very helpful
1,"I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!"
1,"The Echo is a great device. The on;y drawback is sometimes Alexa doesn't understand your question. Other that, it's great. And with the Amazon music, it plays all of the Amazon music. You couldn't ask for anything else. It even plays comedy bits, too."
1,Great tablet for the price.I would recommend this to friends and family
1,"The echo is truly awesome. Alexa is a blast and can answer and do just about anything you ask. The entire family loves it. Weather, sports scores, latest news and ordering pizza. Truly awesome."
1,We ordered 2 of these one for our college daughter and the other our high schooler. They both absolutely love them. I have to admit we steal it every once and awhile. Love it.
1,"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
1,"I love my Fire Tablet - it has beautiful screen and many extra features that my older Tablet did not have - while it is still a compact size, it is light and pleasant to use. I would recommend again and again."
1,"I researched several different e-readers before deciding to purchase this tablet. This one was the best fit financially and it also allowed me more flexibility to access books from my local library. That feature alone is very valuable. I may decide to upgrade to something with less glare for outdoor reading, but for now this is perfect. Very easy to keep in my bag and since I am an android user this was not difficult to learn."
1,"Purchased this for my girlfriend who loves it. Great upgrade, even from the Kindle fire HD"
1,Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!
1,I wanted to get a portable Bluetooth speaker that I could use while out as well as at home. The tap has great sound quality and Alexa is more useful than I would have thought.
1,This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.
1,I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.

1,After rooting and placing play store on it I liked it more. Not bad for the price.
1,Easy to use and is handy to have. It is not small but not to big either.
1,IT is great. Easy set up. All family members enjoy it.
1,"so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one...."
1,Good tablet for kidsand for adults.Does the job ...
1,"I use the echo every day. I play Jeopardy with my kids. It is very easy to set up and use. My favorite skill is the list maker. I just tell it what I need and it populates the list on my phone. I have lamps connected to the echo, and I can just tell Alexa to turn it on and off. I have used it more than once to find my phone! And the selection of music is incredible, and great sound."
1,This tablet is great for kids. It has so many apps and videos that can be downloaded. It has a nice size screen as well. The only thing I don't like is the charger.
0,"I am an Amazon fanboy. I'll say it right up front. This device, although nice, currently has limited functions, especially considering the $200 price tag. So until more useful functions (linking to Google Now for instance) are added, I can only give my Echo as much as it pains me to do so, an average rating. Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category."
0,"my kids get a lot of use out of their tablets. however, I wish the battery life was better."
1,"This is a good product if all you want to do is read emails and do some internet browsing. It does not compare to an iPad or a higher level Android tablet. For this price, I believe it is a good purchase for basic usage."
1,"This tablet offers amazing value for the price. It is not hd but still offers good resolution. Reminds me of the graphics on the first iPad or iPad mini 1. Performance is right up there with the more expensive models. With the ability to add more storage with an SD card, and Amazon customer service, you really can't go wrong with this one."
1,Where has this been all these years! Best purchase ever!
0,"Was a bit difficult to initially set up. Ease in operations would be great, the tablet doesn't hold battery well at all. It seems that maybe and hour or two goes by before time to re-up on battery life."
1,The future is here. This is a great addition to our home
1,"Best product out there, worth buying all day, wouldnt pass on it"
1,I loved the first one I bought so much I bought another one for my bedroom. This has replaced the Chromecast which I had on all my TVs. My house is wired with Cat6 and I have a fast internet connection and streaming from Netflix is almost immediate.
1,If you're a fan of any form of electronic entertainment you're going to love this device
1,I am also dealing with Centurylink at 30 speed. I am considering Time Warner at 15. This I am told will eliminate any streaming problems due to internet speed.
1,no live tv but most of everything else is available and much cheaper than cable! We're saving over $100 a month by canceling cable and only keeping internet
1,Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
1,"First tablet for my daughter whose is only 5 - can navigate and use with ease! For the cost, amazing value - and love the ability to expand with the SD. Tied into Amazon in certain respects but the platform still allows for a number of workarounds. A cant miss for the cost..."
1,Great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning
1,My son picked this device for reading books and accessing kids apps mostly due to the excellent price and user friendliness. I like the parental controls and how it lets me set a daily time limit. Great value!
0,"These were gifts for young family members and they are really enjoying them, but the initial setup was a pain"
1,Like the light background. The font makes it easy to read.
1,Can't beat the price.a great Christmas gift for adults and teens.
0,Good product and will definitely share to all my friends
1,"I love Alexa, she's amazing...She does everything I ask her, she wakes me up, play my playlist from Amazon Unlimited Music perfectly. I like it so much, I bought my fiance one. Thanks for the amazing product Amazon."
1,I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.
1,Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
1,Bought it for my niece over the Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Was worried about the quality since it was so cheap but it turned out great. As a matter of fact the quality was fantastic and easy to use too. Money well spent.
1,"Amazing technology and excellent sound. Alexa is such a treat!! Awesome, interactive product from Amazon."
1,Yes I like it my husband really like the way it work l like that it don't take up to much room
1,Has everything you will ever need inside. For children and adultsA+++
1,I really like this product. I love all the apps. I love the Alexa feature that works with the remote. There are options to mod this as well to do more. Better than an Apple TV. Similar to a Roku.
1,"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
1,This works great and allows us to watch tv movies and shows when it is convenient for us. Love it.
1,It's a learning process google home was friendlier and changed the color of my lights but echo is pretty funny
1,"I wish Alexa were more like Rosie the Robot on ""The Jetsons"" but she is a ton of fun and moderately useful. She may have thousands of skills but in a fairly narrow range -- how many joke or inspiration skills does anyone AI really need? -- so a broader base, with more games, better understanding of smart devices, etc would be spectacular."
1,I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.
1,"I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again."
1,It is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use
1,I gave this amazon echo as a gift for my mother for mother's day. She liked it a lot and use it primarily for music. I set it up for her and having spotify she can ask Alexa a song that she knows from way back her younger years. I have one as well and it's all connected for a smart home and works good with smartthings hub and philips hue.
1,"I am loving this tablet. I bought it during the Black Friday special just to check it out. Ended up buying a second one for my 3 yr old. Now that I know how good they are, I would not hesitate to purchase one at full price. I use it daily for my email, games and web surfing. I have also listened to music, read a couple of books and watched videos. I will say that you do need to remember that it is a $50 tablet, so don't expect to get $200 worth of tablet! But keep your expectations realistic and you will not be disappointed."
1,"I absolutely love my kindle! The battery lasts a really long time, which is great because I read a lot! Easy to work, and I am loving the adjustable back light."
1,"Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
1,"Does all it claim, not yet using much except for music"
1,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!"
1,Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price.
1,"my 3 year old loves her kindle, Netflix and an abundance of games for her to learn from. Exceptionally easy to set up and use"
0,This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. I bought this for about $35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so I didn't wear out the battery on my phone. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.
1,"Got this for one of our employees. Works well and you can see the print well. Good point is that it's small and compact. Bad point is that it's small and compact. Easy to carry around, but more difficult to see words. Works great, though! Great price too!"
1,This is a wonderful reader that is very easy to operate. I especially like the non glare screen and that ability to adjust the font size and the lighting. It is perfect for reading in the sun and in bed as well!!
1,My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.
1,Echo is a very interesting product. So far I just use it for listening to music. I ask it to play my old records from when was much younger. So far she knows them all.
1,Good for kids And adults. I would recommend this tablet to anyone.
1,"Bought this during black friday for $60. while I'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price!"
1,My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy
1,Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage.
1,Super durable hardware that has endless features. From streaming to playing games. this thing is awesome
1,"If you've had a kindle you know it's more like reading a book page. Some will prefer it enough to have this device. My elderly mother uses the version of this that connects to cell towers and is able to download her own books from her subscription service. She had trouble removing them once she hits the download limit. I have this version. If you have wifi, I think this is the best option if you have the money. I don't see much purpose in the upgrade and I don't know who wants a bigger bezel. The touch works fine. My only complaint is there is no speaker and at this price it should. I had to buy an adapter to have books read to me. The text to speech is very good and realistic."
1,I enjoy reading on my paper white Kindle. It is easy to learn how to use it. It fits nicely in my purse and is light weight. There are many font choices and you can make the print large.
1,amazon fire tv is on fire... this is the best stream device now in day.i will highly recommended. the speed is amazing. all you need is a good internet service to enjoy it's maximum potential.and if you have a prime account in amazon you get to enjoy many movies and tv series. get this device for your home
1,"For the price, this is a product that I would recommend to anyone who likes to read."
1,"Perfect size for traveling, sound is amazing and easy to use."
1,Must have device..... having movies in 4K is great
1,This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
1,Easy to use. Fun. Get news weather and music. Great addition to the household
1,Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications.
0,Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.
1,"Great performance for the money, however if you are looking to read in bright sunlight it is not ideal."
1,The sound is amazing -- we mostly play music but also use it to answer questions for fun. I just wish it was wireless. I bought a 2nd one since I loved it so much!
1,"Would love to see more siri like functionality, however this integrates extremely well with my Nest thermostat and with my Philips Hue lighting system. While I am still learning some of the ins and outs of the Amazon Echo, I think I will be happy for a long time to come."
1,"it was a good purchase i dont regret to buy it; it is great for readers, and those who play app games. It is a little slow sometimes."
1,the reason i purchase the item because she love to watch movies on her phone.
0,"I love the kindle and have had one in one shape or another since they first came out, but I just could not take how slow this model was. I returned it and purchased a Samsung tablet."
1,"As the community grows and more skills are added, this will have added value as time goes on. At this time, we see that companies like Nest, Ford, (well the list goes on) have developed a strong backing in this product. This won't be a fad, but a device we will have in all of our homes."
1,Serves the purpose well specially if one has an older non-smart tv. However there is always additional expenses because most of the features you have to subscribe to and pay for
1,So simple to use! My only complaint is the inability to change the background without going through all kinds of steps and using a special app. :-( I bought it for my 9yr old son and he loves it!
1,Great tablet. This is the third Amazon Fire I have purchased. Purchased this for my 4 year old. Got tired of sharing my tablet with her. She has tons of games and watches movies on her tablet. She also takes a lot of pictures. We decided not to get the childrens version as many reviewers stated the parental controls were annoying.
1,Purchased this tablet for a nephew and they have thoroughly enjoyed it. They are able to do anything they want with it as well as it being an amazon product they have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to the games they want to play.
1,All I've used this tablet is for books and it's great for it.
1,Easy to set up and fun for all ages! Helpful info.
1,"I got this new fire tv with the purpose of canceling my cable company, I save 88$ every month and I'm very happy with it."
1,"Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
1,"Very easy setup and connectivity to my accounts, including ebooks and video. Primarily used as ereader - so far like the one-handed use and haven't noticed glare as a problem."
1,"I ask for weather, headlines and sports updates, while listening to my favorite playlist. Makes the coffee tastes better with a friend."
1,Enjoying my gift Amazon and taking it everywhere I go.
1,This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
1,I like it. Works great and is so easy to set up and use with compatible products.
1,Its just enough for my 3 yr old. Enough storage space. Easy to navigate through.
1,have owned 2 kindles this is far the best. no light required. simple to use
1,"I bought this because it has more storage space, it is easy to set up. I like the SD card option to expand the storage and it has a USB port so if I wanted to I could add an external hard drive."
1,"I just love this toy, with time she will get better"
0,"I was expecting something more intuitive, moving to google.."
1,This is the second Echo I have purchased and I love them. They are a lot of fun and have great sound on top of that. I would definitely recommend.
1,It's the best tablet $50 can buy. touch screen is better then my first gen nexus 7.
1,"i recently cut the cable and was looking for something to have all my streaming apps in one place without having to mirror a phone or tablet, and without having to connect a pc to a tv. this works amazing, never had any problems with it whatsoever, very easy to use, pretty straight forward. highly recommended!"
1,"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
1,You need to find the correct way to ask questions or you will not get good answers. Otherwise I like this item
1,I purchased this to upgrade from my old kindle as it wasn't connecting to the Internet quick enough. I am happy with the connection and speed of this product.
1,My wife & I love Alexa's music capabilities. Alexa is great help with setting reminders & putting appointments on the calendar. We think Alexa is fantastic.
1,Purchased this device for my son and really enjoyed it. Ended up buying another after a day of using the device.Pros:- Fast boot time- Clear & sharp display- Long battery life- Light weightCons:- Adds on lock screen- Inability to remove apps from the home screen (Can only move them to a folder)- Screen shows more fingerprints then say an Ipad or Nexus deviceOverall this has been a great device and hasnt had any issues. I play Game of War on the device and watch Hulu/Netflix for the majority of my use. For an Ebook is it smaller but does the job.
1,"Amazon Fire TV has been a great device and is a big improvement over the Amazon Firestick. With Fire TV, there is no lag in apps and runs smoothly and without delay. The biggest reason we purchased this was to begin using PlaystationVUE and it has worked flawlessly."
1,This tablet was bought for my 4 year old. She uses it to learn.
1,"I bought my first Kindle Fire several years ago. This year I bought 3 (a new one for everyone in my household). Great tablet, lightweight & I love that the newer Kindle has expandable memory."
1,"Wonderful product, seemed operation. No buffering even on a slow dsl connection. I will recommend this to anyone."
1,I am very happy getting this as a gift. I have had a blast getting acquainted with Alexa!!!
1,Not that great but a good tablet. No problems yet.
1,"I got this for my mother for mother's day, and so far, she absolutely loves it. It's fast, great resolution, and I've yet to hear of any battery issues from her. I picked this one for the reasons I just listed in addition to the access to Amazon Underground (FREE APPS that normally cost with Googly Play & Apple Stores, respectively).For those reasons, in addition to the price, you can't go wrong."
1,This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
1,"Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!"
1,Serves the purpose of what it was purchased for even bought the 16 gb one as well!
1,This is the best value for bucks tablet out there in market and that too with awesome Amazon brand value.
1,"Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos."
1,"Come on-- I bought a brand new Amazon Fire for $39! I can download and read my books. I can browse the internet. I can probably do other things if I ever get around to that! It's not a PC. It's not a gamer machine. But what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. If you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this Kindle you should probably ask yourself-- what do I EXPECT to get for this price? One steak dinner, 3/4 of a tank of gas, a case of brews... or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! You really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like I did. Have I convinced you yet? Or are you expecting Amazon to come to your door and hand you a new Kindle for free?!!!"
1,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
1,Love the product!!! Like the way it was easy to assess the apps and email. Can use it anywhere especiallly at work with my clients.
0,Bought for my little daughter and so far it's holding up good.
1,I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
1,Great item. Price was good. Very happy with my purchase.
1,"Screen is good, internet moves fast, easy to use and set up"
1,"Good product for cutting cable cord and saving money. Faster and more features than Roku or Fire stick, very pleased with product. I originally received a defective remote, Best Buy customer service was excellent in trying to find a new one, even from competitor, they replaced with brand new unit same day I called, even though Best Buy warranty expired 2 weeks earlier."
1,"Small, portable works as a blue tooth speaker when I take it away from home with me."
1,I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
1,Got one for my 4yr old. She loves it. It's very durable. I love that I can switch accounts and use it for myself too.
1,Amazon Fire TV is use easy to use. I has everything you need and tons of apps!
1,"Or at least a future I'd like to be living in :-)Lets get this straight. As a Prime member, you can get this for 99. At that rate, think of it as:- A wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to!- An alarm clock that you can shout at (Alexa! Shut up!) in the morning, and it will obey you :) (its my half asleep morning power trip)- Set a timer for when you're cooking- Fact check your friend while you argue with them :PSo my common use cases aside, here's what is good about Echo:- Speech recognition works *really* well, esp for brief phrases.- It can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room, and is pretty accurate with the wake word (I've been using Alexa)- As a music player, its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up, without having to hunt through a playlist, connect to the bluetooth speaker etc.- Purchasing music is pretty seamless. (As if Amazon needed another way to get you to spend money:-) )- iHeart radio integration, if you're into that kinda thingHere is what is not so great:- Speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts, maybe because of my accent. (e.g. Alexa, play the song The Troubles by U2- As a music player, its a bit lacking in bass.- Sometimes, while its playing music, you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention- Bing search Really *rolls eyes*I'd love to see in the future:- Integration with Fire TV, so that I can simply say Alexa, play The Sopranos on my TV- Google search- Being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts Alexa, message XYZ blah blah blahOverall, its a pretty cool product, and I'd love to see what it looks like over time!"
1,for the price this is a solid win. Nothing beats this tablet for the price you are paying. a steal of a device.
1,"This tablet exceeded my expectations in so many ways! Bought the first a couple months ago for my son's 5th birthday, at this price, i wouldnt be heartbroken if he broke it. Then i got one for my niece, planning to get 2 more, see how excited i am about it? Well worth the price!!"
0,"My granddaughter used her phone constantly to play games and when she needed to make a call phone is dead. Now with tablet, she FaceTime me more and her phone now keep a chatge."
1,Just get it already! So much reviews on this thing already I won't add anything to it other than it.......
1,"Bought this tablet for my fiance daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it."
1,"Able to download books and read most anywhere, best invention since sliced bread according to my wife"
1,Good product for my family and gave gift to my fri
1,This has been great buy. Two friends liked ours and bought one
1,I bought this for a friend. I have the 2013 version and I love it. Great gift for avid readers and those just looking for something light to hold. The Backlighting makes it wonderful for reading in the middle of the night. :)
1,"This is my second one purchased, what else can I say. Thanks BestBuy"
1,"Wonderful, so glad I got it. Great for reading. Child restrictions are a plus."
1,This is a great product I love the amazon Alexa. Must have if you want a smart house
0,I already have one am sending it back
1,"The Amazon Echo is a well-designed, well-built product. Within a defined set of parameters, it works pretty well and can be integrated with a number of home automation products to make it more useful. In practice though, it's vocabulary is limited and its 'AI' is pretty dumb, so don't expect too much."
1,The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.
1,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where
1,The Fire TV is a wonderful device. I have the Stick and I think that the TV is much better.
1,Great addition for the family new ways to have entertainment and Knowledge.
1,This speaker is awesome but just wished if you ask it questions it knew more
1,"It's great, I can't imagine life without it. I love the built in dictionary!"
1,Incredibly fast tablet charger. Works as advertised without any issues.
0,"I still haven't been able to figures out my kindle, it seems like it has very cool features but learning slowly how to take take full advantage of it."
1,"was able to replace with new, with my warranty. This is is little better than the first one"
0,the description sounded like the base unit was included with the coding game - which it was not.
1,The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!
1,"I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product."
1,The voice recognition isn't great yet but it will only get better. The potential is endless. Good sound quality.
1,"This is an excellent choice for an e-reader. I purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun. It did a great job, was easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun. the backlit display at night was very nice and makes reading a breeze anytime without problem. I have an older nook book that is color. I chose the amazon version so that I could subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program. in comparison between the 2 brands I do like the nook better for easy of moving between pages - I haven't figured that out quite yet on the kindle, but I'm sure it's quite easy. there's also no person that I can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something. if you are a person who likes being shown how to use a device. I know my mom who is 80 might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but 95% of the people most likely won't. Best thing I like and am glad I invested was the backlight."
1,Thos is awesome does everything it says and more only thing is its not portable but amazon sells a aftermarket charger base that makes it portable
1,Surpassed my expectations it charges faster than the one that comes with kindle fire when new. So I would purchase another if I ever need a new one.
1,We bought this to stream TV so we could cut our cable bill. Streaming live TV with Playstaion Vue and watching movies through Amazon Prime has worked well. We also have the less expensive Fire Stick and this product works much better.
1,My wife loves the kindle paperwhite to read on. She has not put it down sense we bought it. Battery life is great.
1,Very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it
1,So easy for parents to keep track of what their children are doing!
1,My 84 year old father has no issues with it and is very intuitive.
1,"Purchased this as a Mother's Day gift. My wife loves it, and really enjoys the night reading ability and says it doesn't cause any eye strain."
1,Very good picture quality. Performs as advertised and worth the prize paid for.
1,"I was looking for just the right e reader for my wife""s birthday. She loves to read in bed before she falls a sleep and her old one did not light up so she would struggle to try and read in the dark and use whatever little beam of light she could to be able to read while I slept and with this one it is not even a problem any more the screen lights up and she can easily read while I am sound a sleep."
1,We bought 3 fire tablets for Christmas. The kids loved them. It was a perfect gift to give.
1,"For the price you have to deal with a lot of pre-loaded stuff, but it is a great price for a capable tablet."
1,"The Amazon Echo is a lot of fun and very useful. The ability to add events to a calendar, get the weather and news and play music from your amazon account and others really rocks!!"
1,I enjoy listening to I heart radio on this device all day
1,I use this for my daughters educational apps. She loves it. perfect size for her hands and still big enough for her to enjoy Peppa Pig.
1,Nice tablet to teach my nephew about computers however I wish I would have realized that you can not access the play store.
1,"In my search for a wireless speaker, I looked at various models and decided on this one because of the portability, the look and how it synced with Alexa. I have an Alexa and this product was spot on! The sound is great! I use it in the balcony and stream all music from pandora, different stations and the quality is great!! Definitely would recommend!"
1,"Bought this for my son to encourage his reading ,and very pleased with this device. I have sideloaded the ability to rent library books and it works well. He can read easily without tiring his eyes or needing to go to library frequently. Since I have to drive him everywhere it helped both of us. I wish there were more apps available and native library rental specifically."
1,I purchased 3 of these as gifts and they are being used all the time. Great tablet.
1,"Great for weather, time, trivia and Pandora radio. Alexia probably can do more, but I don't have the time to study how."
1,My children love this tablet! Great tablet for the price!
1,I bought this product as a gift for a couple of boys. They really enjoy it. It also works great with Amazon Prime.
1,"Although the Price point is a bit high for what it is I love the new kindle. The screen is beautiful, the back light with auto-adjust dimming is great, and it feels very sturdy to hold. I am very glad that I upgraded form the nook but can only give 4 stars due to price."
1,This tablet was affordable and it's pretty decent.
1,Alexa is great. She plays music . She can answer questions and tell you the weather. I am still learning all that she can do .
1,Very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great.
1,I ordered this as a Christmas present for my wife. She fell in love with it!!!
1,"My family got this for Christmas, and I was worried they would like it and/or use it. Boy, was I wrong! They love it and use it everyday. Love all the things it can do -- get one!"
1,Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing
1,this was a gift. My dad loves it! It does exactly what he needed it for with a great price!
1,This product is AMAZING!.. I'm loving it. No need t touch and connect all the time.
0,Tried to use it for and it's does not work as ebookWhich is why I am not satisfied ..
1,"As an owner of an iPad, I hesitated to consider the Amazon Fire Tablet as a supplemental device but my purchase of a network of Amazon Echo Dots and the Voice Cast capability with the Fire tablet was almost irresistable. So I bought one as a gift for my friend along with an Amazon Echo Dot to get her opinion of its value. My friend just raves about the Fire Tablet - especially the smaller, light-weight aspects of it. I know I would feel better toting around a small Fire tablet that costs only $40 instead of a $500 iPad so it looks like the next Fire tablet will be for me!"
1,Great tablet for the kids as it includes some good educational apps and has a good case that surrounds it for durability.
1,The 2nd generation fire tv is great for Amazon services. This is my second fire tv and I purchased it to stream Playstation Vue. I love the Vue service and the fire tv is much faster than the fire tv stick
1,"Purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife and she loves it! Mostly plays music on it now, but I'm sure its usage will expand as time goes by."
1,"I was worried that my son wasnt going to like the software, but he's having lots of fun with it"
1,"Got this for my son, he loves it and is easy to use and add stuff for kids, the warranty is an added bonus. Plus pretty durable, since having a 2 year old, when he throws fits, this gets thrown as well."
1,The only thing missing is SONOS integration. When Amazon managed to allow for echo to be conected to an speaker system such as SONOS this product will be deserving of a 10 star.It does what is mean to do flawless.
1,"I have older versions of the kindle fire, and I bought this one to replace my daughter's ""aging"" kindle-which she uses constantly. This one has 2 camera phones, one rear and one front, compared to her one that has just one (rear). Also, the graphics are better and it has more MG than her old one, which is great because she pretty much maxed out her other one. She uses it to read, play games, and do homework (even can check her grades online). All around, it is quick to turn on rather than using a computer to get what she needs for easy homework (online research, calculator, etc.) and a lot more portable when traveling!"
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandfather to use. He likes to play casino games and read! This works great for it. He is even learning to use the camera!
1,"A great product for the price, performs bigger than what you would expect. The memory expansion elevates this tablet to allow for multiple content and apps."
1,"Best Buy had a sale on the FireTV and I jumped at it. I was most interested in the speed increase over our FireTV Stick. I have been very pleased with the upgrade. I like having a microphone on the remote to do voice searches... or now Alexa commands (""turn on the lights"", ""trigger"" IFTTT scripts). The speed over launching a navigate apps is much improved (we have been using PS Vue a good bit).Very pleased :)"
1,This was a gift for my 3 year old. I am so happy with my purchase. This try to keep some busy so I can now catch up with doing the things I loved.
0,this was just ok... wish the camera quality was better.
1,". Works great. Super fast loading opposed to the firestick and rokus. I love it, one of the best quad processor TV boxes out there."
1,Perfect size for playing online games and searching the web.
0,"turning pages not as easy as the original ones; whole Home Page experience not really user friendly, and seems geared to just sell you more books."
1,I like this tablet but you need to register a credit card to get free apps.
1,a little confusing if you are not already signed up for Pandora. also what does Echo do that the Dot doesn't?
1,nothing to say about this product...bought as a gift
1,Great product at great price!I love what I bought!
1,"Quenn Alexa, does it all. Move over Christina Aguilera, Alexa is the new genie in a bottle. She knows it all, weather, sports, history, music. Who needs school when you have your own personal teacher at voice command. You betta werk Alexa!"
1,I bought this tablet for my wife and she loves it!
1,Nice tablet for the price. Got it for my son Birthday. Hasn't opened it yet but my brother in law has 2 and it works great. Great tablet for kids just in case they break it
1,I love to read and using the Kindle has been great.
1,"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."
1,"WE PURCHASED THIS IN PLACE OF PAYING THE SKY HIGH CABLE PRICES FOR CHANNELS THAT WE JUST DO NOT USE. OUR TV IS A ROKU SMART TV, BUT WE FOUND THAT WE STILL NEEDED THIS TO GAIN ACCESS TO A FEW STATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH OUR PURCHASE."
1,"If you want a tablet for someone that's not the most tech savy, look no further. Seriously, it's the best 50 bucks you will spend."
1,I have looked at getting a Kindle for over a year and have looked at the specs and also other tablets. I enjoy reading and when traveling have to pack 4-6 books when I cruise. I decided to get the Kindle Fire - great price and get it a try. I love it and will someday upgrade to a larger model. Have read 5 books all ready and have 30 more waiting to be read. Great one to start using an ereader.
0,Screen resolution could be better. I got what I paid for. Fine for browsing.
1,The Amazon fire tablet has alot of features im very pleased with it.
1,A Very hot item that was used for a charity raffle.
1,"I am a big fan of e-readers. I prefer the e-ink screens over tablet screen when reading books. I decided to pick up the new Kindle Voyage. Here are my thoughts.First, the Kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the Paperwhite model. It's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.Secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make. If you're a casual reader who has a Paperwhite, you're probably okay with what you have."
1,I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
1,"I love it, am a big reader and enjoy having the fire. Beacuse I get to read and surf the internet. And is small not to big"
1,Excellent product by Amazon. Many uses to make my life easier and fun. I have 2 Echos and a Dot. Well worth the money.
1,Great tablet for someone who don't have any experience with electronics.
1,"It's great for kids at this price, not its not an iPad. Can only buy from kindle, so apps are somewhat limited. This edition added a SD slot to add storage!!"
1,"Bought this for my mom who has never owned a tablet before, she love's it.easy to use!"
1,"my daughter cant put this thing down, so it's doing what it's supposed to do."
1,This device is the perfect way to consolidate all your favorite TV apps. Easy to use. Easy to set up.
1,We puchased an Echo as a start to our home automation and fell in love with it's sound and capabilties.
1,"We use this on a daily basis, a nice upgrade from the fire stick!"
1,"Works great, several apps for my kids to choose from."
1,Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
1,Price great for quality and versatility. Bought for son to use for streaming movies and reading books. Great product for him but had to purchase extended memory miniSd card.
1,Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it.
1,"...but mind the quality control. For $40 - $50, you get an amazingly capable tablet for media consumption. Streaming services, surfing, and reading are all handled perfectly fine, however, the tablet lacks the power to be a gaming platform.Please note, this is actually my 3rd tablet, as the first 2 were returned with the first being covered in dead pixels and the second having terrible light bleed. The 3rd looked and functioned perfectly. Bad batch? Who knows. But watch the quality control."
1,The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it
1,"A while ago, my Echo power supply stopped working. At the time, Amazon was out of the OEM power supply and provided me with a replacement from China. That one worked but was bulky and not as good looking as the OEM one, so I decided, when Amazon had caught up with back orders, to reorder a 'real' power supply. Very glad that I did.Sleek, stylish power supply for my Amazon Echo. Works as it should, and hopefully will last longer than my previous power supply!"
1,Our young son spends hours fully engaged playing games on his tablet.
1,"I bought one for my daughter, so I decided to buy one for me the tablet is very user friendly."
1,"We enjoy asking questions, listening to music. Need to learn more of the things that it can do. Great voice recognition."
1,This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner. The much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire.
1,My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.
1,Good products I would advise every one to get one it work great and easy to install
1,great tablet! So convenient. satisfied with this product. MY KIDS LOVE IT!!!
1,"If you have Amazon Prime, this is an excellent way to view content in a small, quality device."
1,Easy to install and use. Great for streaming movies and getting Amazon movies.
1,For $50 dollars I would buy this tablet 99 out of 100!
1,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
1,Easy to start using and a fun approach to choosing the right program to watch. I am enjoying sharing with friends.
1,This has exceeded our expectations. We love it and would recommend it!
1,Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,"I love this little tablet! The clarity is very nice, it boots up fast and is simple to use. The price was so right, too! And the extra SD card slot is such a plus. I use an iPad too but this tablet is great for reading my eBooks. A great buy!"
1,Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!
1,"This is my fourth Echo device and me and my family are loving it. We use it many times in a day for various things like weather, time, controlling lights and other appliances. New feature of Music grouping makes it even better for filling your entire house with music."
1,Good beginner/budget tablet. Worth the price. Happy with my purchase.
1,Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
1,"This is a very affordable e-book reader. It works well in the dark because it is backlit, and it is very simple. The lightness helps a lot, and I usually buy Kindle books now instead of other books because it is so much easier to carry."
1,Saw it at my friend's house and thought it would be fun to have it. Looking forward to more added function in the future. I enjoy talking to Alexa every morning and evening after I get home. Now I play Spotify music and I Heart Radio through it and the speaker works great! Enjoy this new toy!
1,"Pro's: many. You can integrate and use easily with Spotify, Sirius, and Wink just to name a few. Great for news and weather too. Con's: For the privacy conscious, this is not your best friend as it listens for everything just to catch the word Alexa and the following command. For example, if you mention in a conversation the word ""alexa"" it will do whatever comes after."
1,"Pros: This tablet is great for its price, has good battery life and it is resistant enough for daily use. Cons: The operating sistem is limited to only downloading apps from the Amazon App Store and the screen resolution is no that great."
1,The speaker on this unit really impressed me. It is as good as my little Bose bluetooth speaker. Super convenient to stream music from Amazon Prime. This product is a nice add on to those who are Amazon Prime members. I am looking forward to integrating it with more things.
1,Picked this up on Black Friday for about $40. It works great for another tablet sitting in the living room for a quick internet search and apps to control tv and Sonos.
1,"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!"
1,"My Kindle fire hd stopped working and I replaced with this. Works well, the picture isn't as clear as the hd, but for the cheap price it is fine"
1,So much more powerful and with an actual LAN connection the speeds are much better too. If you can afford it get the box over the stick.
1,"I would recommend this product to anyone on a budget or who wants something bigger than an Iphone for searching purposes. It does everything my Iphone does. But I wanted a tablet for reading, spotify, netflix, and just the ease of a bigger screen. $40 Bucks why not!?"
1,The Echo is great! Be sure and check out the Alexa skills!
1,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!
1,This helps my high schooler when she needs help with homework.
1,handy size and works well for what it is. would be a 5 if google play store. (but it is available)
1,We purchased the Kindle Fire as a Christmas gift forfpor Son in law and really not sure what he thinks about it since he has not said anything except thank you when he opened it on Christmas morning. Sorry.
1,This tablet operates wonderfully. The size is handy. The graphics vibrant.For the affordable price it is unbeatable :-)
1,This tablet is very easy to read and holds a charge for a very lengthy period of time.
1,"Turning,sometimes the pages turn when your not aware of it. The battery length is much better."
1,Received this as a gift and set it up the first night. Love Love Love it!
1,Grandkids love Alexa. Great for so many things! Everybody should have one!
0,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage.  Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
1,Very good item for the money was happy with my purchase.
1,I purchased the fire 7 almost one year ago. It is a very good tablet for the money. Screen resolution isn't the best but is adequate. But at this price point I am not complaining. WiFi seems to have slowed a bit since when it was new and I dont have many apps and I do clear the background tasks. That being said it is faster than my previous fire HD 2012 generation. Cameras are so so but I don't use them often if at all. Having the micro SD slot is great. Amazon does a great job of automatically up dating the OS. I just received the Alexa update yesterday. Pick this tablet up on Black Friday oor an even better deal!
1,"This tablet is awesome! I use this tablet to look at my emails, check facebook, browse the internet, playing games, shop a little and of course, read books. Does all this with ease, and I don't have any issues or problems. Lots of apps to load with ease. Great product!Overall, This Kindle fire works great and meets my needs. I could not be more happy with my purchase. Highly recommend!!!"
1,Its great. It has been a lot of fun and its very loud. In fact its so loud that it cannot hear you tell it to stop. Lol
1,"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
1,Got this for my granddaughters birthday and she loved it so my other granddaughter wanted one so I brought another one and they both loved them
0,This tablet freezes a lot when using it. It started out working good and then it started freezing when playing games.
1,Really like the Amazon fire tv. It's an awesome product to have for tv lovers!!! Make sure u have strong Wifi!!!
1,Great price for product category. Does what it's supposed to.
1,I ordered these for all of my grandkids. Easy to use. Just turned them on and ready to go.
1,"easy to setup, great for traveling and reading on the plane"
1,Step son wanted a tablet and nowadays kids are up to date on technology so the kid friendly tablets weren't enough for him. Perfect for kids when iPads are way too expensive for a first tablet
1,For the features and the price i got it for on black Friday I can't complain.
1,This is so much better then the dog. Speaker is very good quality.
1,great value. first time trying this particular product. very happy
1,Lots of fun to use with other smart home devices.love it
0,"I bought this product to gift to a 8year old kid and she loved it. she plays games, puzzles."
1,"Contemplated getting a Kindle Paperwhite for several months before purchasing. My Kindle Paperwhite is fantastic! It is light-weight, easy to handle, and worth every penny I paid for it. The first thing I did was download (free) books I never had the opportunity to read.... mainly classics, books on philsophy, government, and leadership. I love that I can take it with me and read to my heart's content. Made a great decision when I made this purchase."
1,Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
1,Picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. She loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. She can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. I even use it sometimes!
1,I like this Device great sound very easy to use I like this device because it doesn't take up much Space and this device operates a lot of things on my own like my thermostat my lights and even unlock my door and set my iSmartAlarm great
1,I have a kindle fire and love mine so I decided to get one for each of the grandkids. There are so many learning games that are fun for them plus you have parental control
1,"Very easy to operate. It is a great size, and light weight. It is good for games, books, and pictures. I love it!"
1,"This was a great gift for my son. He wanted a reader for e-books and was delighted to have a tablet to search the web, do e-mails, etc"
1,Excellent choice for watching television and movies
1,"I bought this as a gift for a teen. I already have one and love it. Being able to select a new book to read any time of the day is great. I am a library user so wasn't sure I was get much use out of a kindle. I have grown to love it. Many free books are available and you can share your selections with others. Functions allow you to increase font size, read it either portrait or landscape (great for reading in bed), and screen brightness is adaptable. Can play games on it, and you need wifi just to acquire new books. You can take it anywhere to read your books."
0,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...
1,"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only..."
1,My 10 year old loves this tablet and I loved the price. Very easy to use with my Amazon account.
1,"It's my first time to buy a discount product on web. It's is fantactic. I definitely like the reader. If possible, I want to buy another one for my friend at such low price. :)"
1,Love alexa. She truly is a personal secretary. 2 thumbs up
1,"I bought this for my husband, so he would quit turning the light on to read in the middle of the night. It is a great value for what I needed"
1,"Nice to have music, alarms, shopping list, lights, all available at the sound of your voice, works great! Hub for home, Highly recommended!"
0,"Onsale is 39.99 is cheap , good for new stars tablet"
1,Great to use to make your old TV an smart TV. Enjoy Netflix and all amazon has to offer!!!
1,Bought this tablet for my nephew and he loved it ! Easy to set up and easy to use !
1,"This is the ""must have"" device for 2017. Excellent choice."
1,This is a great item to have. Integrates well with different home security items.
1,"This was a birthday gift for my son-in-law and he loved it. Coupled with the portable battery, it provides him with both entertainment and information whereever he goes!"
1,Am enjoying using Echo. Learn more things to do with it each day. Sound is good and I enjoy listening to music on my Echo! Also like finding out about the weather each day.
0,After setting up the Amazon Fire it froze on me and I had to return it !
1,My primary interest in streaming (this was new to me) was to stream The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime. I figured an Amazon device was the easiest way to do this. And I was correct. The Fire TV is easy to use and works great. I have fast internet (50-60 mpbs download) so I have no complaints about picture quality.
1,"This 8"" tablet is much better than the older 7"" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version."
1,If you're looking to install kodi this is an excellent buy. Fast processor easy to use and a good price.
1,"This is fantastic! We're finally tapping into the world of ""Smart homes"". However, with all the different devices, brands and apps it makes controlling all the devices a little bit cumbersome. So you can either get one brand and stick to it... OR... you could get this! The Amazon Echo consolidates and integrates ALL your devices. So now you can control all your devices, regardless of the brand, through the Echo. Also, the voice recognition is top notch."
1,"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
1,"This is a great tablet for my 3 year old grandson. The cover is great in that, if he drops it, it won't break! Great buy"
1,We love this fire tv as it has everything we need to watch movies and shows as well as fast streaming
0,"Bought this to replace 2015 Black Friday Fire after and the battery died. While there is a lot of value built into the tablet, the battery in the first one started acting up after 6 months and progressed into not able to hold a charge. As my family had grown to like it, we bought another one with strong reservation. I hope this one lasts longer and I'd recommend it if does."
1,I brought this item for my parent and it fits all of her needs.
1,Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games!
1,We bought two for grandkids and one for mother-in-law and both are happy with the product
1,This is the ideal tablet for my 11 year old girl #1
1,Best Buy makes it easy. No problems. I am a Best Buy Geek.
1,"Bought this for my dad to watch Netflix, and it works very well. Easy to use, which is a bonus"
1,It's nice and simple. Easy to carry around. If you have children its not bad when traveling
1,Great for reading at nightLight is perfect on the screen
1,Bought this primarily to side load Kodi on it for viewing on my new 4k Samsung. Makes an excellent platform for what I use it for. Also enjoy the voice activation of music depending on what I'm in the mood for. No more Pandora!
1,Cool little gadget.. can say what I want to ask and for the most part responds correctly... every now and then though it starts talking without even asking it something.
1,Upgraded from Generation 1 kindle with buttons that had all the letters worn off to this newer generation kindle. Love the touchscreen and the ability to sit out on the patio with a fire and read all night without needing additional light.
1,I love it he is three and does everything on it so many learning games he likes to play he does amazing with it
1,"Good, but unhappy that screen size is small, less than I expected"
1,I love it take a little getting use too.Alexa is very nice she your own personal assistant ask her anything . But first u have to give her skills which are in the app.
1,easy to set upgreat musicamazinggreat addition to the kitchen countertop
1,"love the easy set up, the navigation is very intuitive. Great to have access to all my music uploaded to Amazon Prime Music. Alexa works well too to play and pause music and shows."
1,It works perfect
1,"This has been a lot of fun to own. I've not explored every function but everything I've used works great. Only complaint, seeing music at full volume pretty much nixes Alexa's ability to hear the next command and the speakers are so capable, the next command is often to turn the volume down."
1,I bought this tablet to replace my daughters Nook. She loves it. It's great for on the go.
1,No regrets with this device. The Paperwhite from Amazon is a cheaper model that's worth looking into if this model is too much. I used to read on various iOS/Android tablets but wanted to get something that allows me to read ebooks but also have weeks of battery life on a single charge. All those books on such a small and thin device is still amazing to me. This and the official Amazon case is what I use.
1,Bought it specifically for Sling TV and it streams Extremely well on all apps including Hulu and Netflix. It took the place of my PlayStation 3 for video streaming and has been a pleasant improvement with much less buffering and almost no load times .
1,"I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use."
1,Absolutely just a fun devices lots of options. Learn the device and learn the abilities it can do!!
1,Really fun and informative. Questions are sometimes confusing to the device and it answers bizarrely.
1,Great size. Very portable. I like to carry this one in my bag. Holds alot of my favorite books. Easy to read.
1,The price is great the feel of it in ur hands don't feel cheap
1,Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
1,"My whole family loves Alexa. We play games (20 questions, jeopardy, etc), get weather updates, turn on or dim lights, update the grocery list and much more. She also sings Happy Birthday with us!"
1,This purchase was a no-brainer. The Kindle Paper white is all you need for an e-reader. Plus with Amazon you have an opportunity for many free e-books.
1,Small amd neat. Everything you need on this little device.
0,"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
0,"I was somewhat disappointed to discover Alexa could not seem to answer what I thought were fairly simple questions (mileage distance between locations, etc.). Additionally, I was not comfortable upon discovering the product constantly recorded conversations."
1,"Got this for my dad for Christmas. He loved it! He gets on and plays games and browses on the internet. Screen is not to big but not to small it's perfect for him. Works fast! And has some cool little updates such as ""Alexa"""
1,"This tablet was a great buy. The price was lovely, so I purchased three of them for my nephews for Christmas! They love them! They've been very functional for what they are being used for. I have no complaints and they don't either!"
1,My wife is an avid reader and ju St had surgery. On her neck. She is healing well but finds it hard to hold the weight of a book. i bought the kindle for her ad she loves it because she reads in bed and can easily handle it because it is so light. She loves that she can get books in French and any other language she wants.
1,We went from a Roku 1 to this and are very pleased. Not fair to compare the two as the Roku 1 is old tech. You would have to compare it to the Roku 4. This streams very smoothly. Look and feel are great. So is voice search for Amazon Prime content.
1,Was a present for my grandson. He uses it all the time and loves it.
1,"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
1,I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.
1,This device is a classic reader for people also a good gift for students. It is very comfortable to use it.
1,"It's small, light and easily portable. Powerful enough for all your basic tablet needs like streaming, reading, light gaming and Internet browsing. Perfect for a child's first tablet or on-the-go use."
1,"Bought this for my 4 yr. old for Christmas, she loves it and is very easy to use. The battery lasts a long time"
1,"The first one I received was doa, the second one has worked flawlessly."
1,I love it I can read anywhere day or night and my kids can read on it too
1,Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it.
1,Love it. Everything and more. Love to check the weather and play games
1,"These Fire TV boxes are a bit bigger then the Fire stick but carry much more processing power and memory. There is virtually no lag when using the standard Fire apps, and only a small amount when using 3rd party apps (Kodi). There are tons of tutorial online to get the most out of your Fire TV."
1,"Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it."
1,Easy to navigate. Great for kids and adults. Parental control features. Love a tablet and EReader in one!
1,This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.
1,My grandson loves it and there are lots of educational games .
1,The screen is very pleasant to read with. Overall would recommend it.
1,"This was a gift for my daughter and her family. Everyone has discovered their own favorite uses for ""Echo"". Mom loves to use it to set multiple timers and check weather, kids play ""Bingo"" and Dad quickly gets news updates to start the day. I am pleased that everyone in the family has found a use for this gift. Very happy with my purchase!"
1,"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
1,Its a very nice product to purchase. They give you 1 year of free stuff from amazon. You can download all kinds of apps. Great tablet.
1,This is an awesome kindle easy to transport and love the clear screen.
1,"I have not had such a reliable speaker before. It is so easy to charge, and so easy to start playing songs right away. With Alexa, you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and pulling up Google.com. Love it."
0,"It's a great product to have , loud speaker , however if you don't have any accessories to go with it don't buy it but if you have the money buy it"
1,"I love the Echo...have been using it constantly to play music, for reminders, calendar entries, etc. Very satisfied"
1,"Have the black and the white, identically wonderful."
1,I am very pleased with my Kindle Fire except for the battery area gets hot after a while. I use my Kindle to read eBooks and holding it can get a little warm.
1,"I purchased this item for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to use, beautiful picture, and a great price."
1,"wow. best price for a tablet. if google did with chromecast to pave streaming world, this tablet with amazon underground will be the next phase of free app world to come."

1,"Perfect for lazy people. Allows you to set ur best thermostat, turn off lights, set alarms. Love it !"
1,Bought this as a gift and the giftee really loves it!
1,"I liked it so much I got 2 and the battery life is amazing. I will buy more when ever they go on sale I have 8 grandkids, these would be perfect for them."

1,Easy to understand and good quality of colors on display .
1,"X'mas gift for my wife, and she love it! She loves the backlight that doesn't hurt your eye compare to an iPad."

1,Really happy with it. Easy to set up and every day I find new features to it.
1,She understands the requests well and plays music or does as instructed. Siri should take notice
1,This will be the perfect Christmas gift for my grandson who loves to use his little sisters tablet. Easy to use and very reasonable price.
1,"I bought two and gave them to my nieces , they just enjoyed them the minute they were in their hands . Made them so happy !"
1,"My daughter loves it! She uses it with ease, which makes me an mommy very happy. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Very helpful employees at Best Buy as well."
1,I got this for my friend for Christmas & she was thrilled when she got it! I have an older one & use it all of the time. Very pleased with this product!
1,Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list.
1,"I used a Kindle many years ago but didn't like the size or the weight or the lack of backlight. This solves all those problems. I find the screen is a little small for my vision. When I increase the font size t I need to turn the kindle page more times than a book page. But that's me. Otherwise, it does well, turns the page smoothly and is easy to use."
0,Good as a reader. Decent tablet for price. After a few months battery drains quickly.
1,bought kindle for my wife she uses it for everything especially reading. loves it.
1,This is my second kindle. It is definitely a significant upgrade. It has great resolution and the non glare for use outside it great . The smaller size is much better.
1,Love how many possibilities there are with this product.
1,This is a great device. Easy to use. Long battery life and nice functionality
1,"Other than the fact that the set up for an iPhone was extremely exhausting and frustrating, the device itself works great and is a lot of fun and helpful ."
1,"This is my third Amazon device. I have one on every tv. Works perfectly, and the 2nd Gen has awesome clarity!!"
1,"I'm an IT Director so would put myself on a higher level of technical capabilities... My wife is an average PC and smart phone user and has been gracious enough to put up with my desire to add automation to my home. Hands down we both agree that adding this was the best decision ever. Prior to adding the Amazon Echo to our home we would have to use the controller on the wall or an app on our phones to control lights, door locks, garage doors and thermostats. With a little bit of searching online you can find all the help you need to get Alexa linked to your other services and accounts. My Wink home automation shortcuts can now be set off by voice command. When I walk in the door with my arms full I simply say ""Alexa, turn on entry lights"". When it is time for the kids to get settled down I say ""Alexa, trigger reading mode"" and all lights are set to the desired levels. Time for bed? ""Alexa, trigger night mode"" and all lights shut off, garage door closes (if left open) and all deadbolts lock on exterior doors. Ask ""Alexa, what's up?"" and she gives current time, temps, forecast and top news. When we sat down with the kids to open Christmas gifts... ""Alexa, play some classic Christmas music"". No, I don't work for Amazon... I'm simply amazed at how far things have come. Get this product, be patient and do research if you are having issues and I'd be willing to bet that you'll love this product."
1,Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound
1,great tablet at a great price. easy to use. great screen quality
0,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
1,This kindle paperwhite is exactly what I was looking for to read outdoors and the backlight is great to read at night
1,"Has so many games for the kids to choose from, I love that I can make different profiles for each kid to limit what they play"
0,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
1,"Works just as you'd expect. Small and compact which is nice, and charges the kindle really quickly (faster than it charges on my laptop). A little expensive for what it is, but glad I ordered this."
1,Processor is speedier than the Fire stick and almost no lags. HD quality content readily available.
1,I was a little worried getting these since we have always had Apple but wow what a great buy. Tons of games same as iPad and Hulu and Netflix access. Thank god I grabbed these instead of iPads
1,"I bought an Amazon Fire tablet for my sister some years back (she didn't want anything more in her life that was techie but she did love the large tablet) and she uses it a lot. I got the Amazon Echo for her for Christmas and it is a great complement to the Fire tablet. With very minimal training (5 minutes) she can call up music channels from Pandora, play her own music, ask about the weather and lots of other stuff that she may not do but could do. It is very helpful to use the apps on the Fire tablet to set the Pandora channels, and otherwise tweak the Echo."
1,"I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own."
1,"Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can't beat the price."
1,"Great for the kids and the parents! We purchased for our kids and myself, easy to use for all of us."
1,"Love it, its so easy to setup and use. The box is powerful and keeps up with everything that I am streaming, including games. This is a great unit and I have had no issues with it. Highly recommend. Also, check out some of the other apps you can load on this device, its very open and there is a lot you can do with it. If you're into electronics and having a great home entertainment setup then this is a must have."
1,We bought the Google unit and then returned it based on excellent word of mouth reviews from friends for the Amazon Echo. The kids use it often. Alexa has not disappointed us.
1,"Just perfect, for my child who is only 9 years old"
1,Absolutely best amazon product ever! Very easy to navigate. Love everything about it.
1,"Before the Echo we played music often for our toddler via Pandora on the Amazon Firestick. I am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology, but with a 95% music use case in mind and to experiment I pulled the trigger and bought one. Within a week I subscribed to the single-device option for Amazon Music Unlimited at a cost of 3.99/month after a free 30-day trial. Now we rarely use Pandora due to the expansive Amazon selection. I also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into Philips Hue Color lighting. My experience has been positive enough to also buy an Echo Dot with Harman-Kardon Onyx Mini speaker for my parents. While great, however, there are opportunities for improvement:1. Sometimes Alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before. I made sure my command was identical and clear.2. The suite of skills is weak and mostly pointless. I only use the news flash, weather, and traffic.3. Search functionality for facts/answers is limited and based on reviews is likely worse than Google Home.4. There is no integration with the Firestick/ Fire TV which is surprising. Currently one must buy a Logitech Harmony hub to do so.5. Alexa struggles to find certain classical pieces even though I have confirmed them to be available on Amazon Music. Part of the problem might be the many versions which exist for a given piece as well as the distinction between composer and performing artist.Overall, I would recommend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music, but don't expect perfection quite yet!"
1,They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro
1,I love this tablet. I store all my kindle books on it. I also set it up for my 4 year old grandson to play on it.
1,Fits nicely in my hand. My third Kindle. Granddaughter likes it too.
1,This tablet is great for using ebooks as a college student
1,It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.
1,"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."
1,Perfect products with perfect recommendations. I enjoy with kindle. Thank you
1,Love that I can talk and someone or something listens.. Haha..Great technology and the sound is amazing. Great price ..
1,So read reviews on a few tablets but honeatly felt this was the one for my kids bought it and sure enough it was it best apps for kids especially reading for kids amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it links up with your account for videos too
1,Great gadget. Cancelled all my movie channels adfter buying it.
1,I have recommended this product to everyone I've talked to. It's easy to navigate and and allows me to mange my TV time.
1,I would encourage everyone to get this product to save on the cost of cable/satellite. A must have!
1,"It's very good for cooking, for weather, for trafic, for music ... it's smart for everything! I recommended very much"
1,It was affordable and it works great I hope it stays that way
1,"Excelent tablet, great price. It's good for any age. You don't need to expend a lot of money, we bought on thanksgiving and we paid less than $49.99."
1,I have no idea why I insisted on paper books for so long. This is so easy and awesome!
1,"This is a great invention. It works really well with my security system, thermostat, door looks and interior lights. What a nice way to feel safe and impress friends and family."
1,"I've already read 4 books on this, and while it took a bit to get used to compared to a physical book, the convenience factor makes this a great purchase!"
1,I love Amazon Fire tv. It works well because it offers the Fox News and my shows I like on PS Vue
1,"I bought this item to give as a gift. I have my own kindle fire 8, so I figured the kindle 7 will be a nice gift for my niece. It delivered what I expected a kindle will do for ereaders."
1,"Purchased this for a gift for a 75 year old, who is enjoying it as she learns all of the ""amazing things it can do!"" She loves playing solitaire and downloading current books to read before she goes to bed at night. Easy, fun, inexpensive tablet for even the least tech savvy people! :)"
1,Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
1,"I buy these as gifts for people , everyone love Alexa ! It's fun , get one"
1,"I own a couple FireSticks and decided to give the Fire Tv a try. I'm glad I did because you can tell the difference right out of the box. Not that there is anything wrong at all with the stick, but the smooth speed and response is a welcomed attribute to my most used television."
1,"I bought this for my granddaughter because it was small enough to be carried around, big enough for her to read books on and her favorite color.It is sturdy in case she drops it. She is very happy with it and uses it all the time. Plus it was on sale and I got it for the same price as a black one. Normally Blue costs more. Don't know why but that is the story."
1,Bought these for all the grandkids for Christmas. Basic enough for a 10 year old but with enough features and capability for the 18 year old!
1,This was a great tablet for a child and even adults.
1,Purchased the Fire Table for an elderly person birthday. They love it and is on the internet all the time reading news articles. The Fire Tablet is a good gift item.
1,I had a fire stick but I gave it away to a family member. I then went to purchase another one but they only had the fire tv in stock. So I reluctantly brought it but I am so much happier now that I have a tv box.
1,If you install kodi you get access to tons of movie although some are low res
1,Got it for our grandson for Christmas and he won't put it down. Comes with free kids software which is great.
1,I definitely recommend getting this amazon tv over just the fire stick. It does a much better job of running all apps over the stick.
1,"Very easy to use, excellent sound for music listening, able to use it to control all my smart home items, highly recommend"
1,"Works great, no connection issues! It has all the apps I need that roku would have"
1,Much easier then using phone all the time. Love it.
1,It does everything it's advertised to do and with some of the expected new releases it should be even more fun and useful
0,"It's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind:- if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. Problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. - if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.On top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. While you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.So, it's useful, but a pain too. Your needs may vary."
1,"Having recently received a Kindle Fire HD as a gift, I knew that hooking it up to my computer to charge it daily was not going to be convenient. That's when I found this little jewel along with the Kindle Fire AC charger. And they both work like a DREAM!. My desk stays uncluttered and the cord allows me to keep the Kindle plugged in while I read in bed or listen to music. It's well worth the price for the convenience it provides!"
1,"Love the Echo! Hands free!! Just tell Alexa what song you want to hear. We have ours in the kitchen and call out songs while cooking and eating. Turn on lights, change the thermostat, and even order a pizza to be delivered. Gotta' have this gadget!!!"
1,"This product is amazing. I am electronically challenged, but can use this item, maybe not to its fullest potential, but I am learning!!"
1,"Does what's advertised! Great with 4K handling. Seems to handle streaming very well. Customize-able. Recommended if you're thinking of ""cutting the cord""."
1,"This is our fourth Amazon Fire TV. Integrates great with Alexa, and so easy to set up with your Amazon account."
1,Good for reading and surfing on the web good for games.
1,Whenever I see an item in the store and the price seem a bit cheap I begin to get very cautious. I ask many questions of other users. Thankfully after having bought this kindle for my nephew he and I have been elated ever since .
1,Great item for watching all new and old movies and or tv shows.
1,"Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app."
1,SIMPLE AND VERY USER FRIENDLY. HAS ALL THE LATEST APPS AND AMAZON'S PRIME USER CONTENT IS SUPERB.
1,very good for the price. our kid loves to play with it.
1,"More than satisfied with my Amazon - Fire TV. I previously had a ""stick"" and gave it to my friend. This product is FAR SUPERIOR. I love that you can use a wireless mouse/keboard via USB port, and have the option using WiFi or an Ethernet cable for network connection. SO MUCH FASTER when hardwired. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE CHOOSE THIS... Definitely worth the couple xtra $$"
1,My daughter really enjoys this tablet. She can't basically do everything except call out.
1,"I use Alexa to update me on the weather, the news and keep a soundtrack going while I am cooking and cleaning. It's nice to have her there to to help me when I just can't use my phone."
1,"We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year."
1,"Great picture, hooked up via Ethernet it works flawlessly. With fire Tv there is no need for a ""smart tv"" or a cable bill."
1,I had got this tablet for my niece for her bday and it's the best.
1,"There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app."
1,Great kindle if you don't want to spend your money for the wifi .
1,"I was truly happy with the product, however, I also purchased 4 $20.00 gift cards each Tablet. Since I was not 100% sure as to what brand to purchase one of your sell staff advised me that I should purchase 4 Google Play gift cards, which I did. To my surprise, on Christmas morning, my grand children were not able to use them because (as your staff should have known) they are not compatible! I took them to the store to exchange them and I learned that not only that Best Buy would not exchange/refund them but that you don't carry the Amazon cards. You have just last a good customer when it comes to purchasing some items that I can purchase online at amazon or another store. I purchased an hp PC and a 12"" Apple IPad at another store just to make a point. I was and still are very disappointed with your sales staff, and your sells practices. I will recommend the tables to a friend but stay way from asking assistance when purchasing the right gift cards..."
1,Great! Product echo streams my music and tells me the weather love it!
1,"I love this tablet primarily for reading. It's inexpensive, portable, and light weight. It has great features, but it's on the slow side when browsing the web. Overall I'm super happy with my purchase."
1,Great streaming device would definitely recommend this to anybody
1,"Set up was easy, content is plenty. My only issue so far is that I use the Amazon fire tv for Playstation Vue, and the guide functionality is horrible. I'm not sure whether to blame it on the amazon fire tv or the playstation vue, but considering the guide is different between the amazon fire tv and the fire stick, I'm going to assume that amazon has some control over the guide for it's products. With that being said I'm definitely disappointed. Hopefully over the next couple months the guide functionality improves. Other than that it has been fantastic!"
1,"We are very happy with this Kindle. Easy to use, user friendly. We like everything about it, it's exactly what we wanted."
1,"Fantastic screen, super long battery life, touch screen navigation, e-ink clarity in all lighting conditions, and the vast Amazon content ecosystem. What's not to like? Nothing."
1,"This item was purchased for seniors to keep them up to date with what is on the internet without the expense of a laptop. they love it and the ease of operation,."
1,I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
1,I've always been a fan of kindles but this one is the perfect size and weight to store in my bag. I'm very satisfied with this product #teamkindlepaperwhite.
1,This is actually my second one in 2 years due to my boyfriend taking ownership of the first one.
1,Great product. Easy to use. Tons of features. A must for every room (with a tv) in the house.
1,"We can watch movies and tv shows in 4K, great picture quality."
1,This is a great system and I really enjoy it. I would recommend this to a friend
1,"I have had both older E-ink Kindle and Nook readers as well as the larger color screen versions and this new one is the best one yet. Very light, portable, battery lasts a long time. The screen is much better than the older E-ink Kindle. I recently binged through the 4th book of Game of Thrones, and it was an easy read on the Kindle. I highly recommend this to any reader. My teenage daughter also enjoys reading on the Kindle as well as opposed to the regular books."
1,"This is the e-reader you want to get if you want to avoid distractions such as any other apps being installed. Just get your books, and go find a tree somewhere."
0,"bought this to see the difference from google's product. was not happy, google was more responsive and easier to use. returned product 2 days later!"
1,Our 3rd Amazon fire. The battery life is outstanding. Really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery. Nice size.
1,I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month
1,"I purchased this for my fiancee for her Christmas present and she loves it. It's got great picture quality, excellent audio and great response/reaction time!"
1,"Easy to set up, easy to use. Good for throwing in your bag and having access to books all of the time"
1,I've really enjoyed using Alexa and have found it more useful that I thought it would. It has really inspired me to start to use Alexa compatible products to make my home smarter.
1,"Small, light weight and battery lasts. I love this thing. Way better than lugging many paperback for long flights."
1,My granddaughter loves watching movies and it goes everywhere with her the size is easy to watch and it has a great picture .
1,This is the best product. You can use for so many things and its such an easy tool to have around!
1,The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet
1,"This device sounds great and has plenty of volume, enough for outside use. It connects to Amazon Prime music and also to Pandora. I also purchased a battery base so that it is portable."
1,I bought the tablet for my nephew for Christmas he really likes it
1,It's a great devise for and older generation women and she loves it
1,This is a great speaker and easy to use. It is really user friendly.
1,I love the Kindle paperwhite reader. I chose the Kindle Amazon Paperwhite because I can read in the sun. We live at the beach and I like to read outside. It is so easy to use. So many books to choose from. Very easy download. Has a lot of great features. It is light weight and easy to take anywhere. Great Product.
1,My 3 yr. old loves this and is the perfect size for our needs
1,"Hands free dimming of lights. Music on demand. Podcasts, weather forecasts, and news in a glowing circular flash. I wish Alexa could do a task at the set time. ""Play Flash Briefing at 6:15 a.m. every weekday"" gets a stumped response. But Alexa can do multiple repetitive alarms so its surely just a matter of time.You should get an Echo but wait for a sale. Then maybe get two Echos."
1,Very happy with purchase. Great item. I'm able to connect my home for wireless use...there are times I stay out later and I am able to turn the lights on remotely for the dog.
1,"Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product"
1,My organization was tasked to give gifts to needy children. So we figured these would be great gifts for the older children since they rarely get gift that they could use.
1,Bought for my 14 year old son for Christmas. He likes the Amazon fire and using frequently...primarily for playing games. My husband has had one for several years and uses it every day.
1,this is a perfect tablet for our 10 year old so he can play games
1,Adjustable backlights are much nicer than clip on light.
1,It does every thing I need it to do for my son. It is very helpful when we are doing homework.
1,Always content with best buy and their products. I would definitely recommend.
1,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
1,"Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap."
1,"Tablet is great, it is used for several hours a day and there is no problem with power. Just a the right size for it's purpose."
0,"Have taken this for a couple of years for calmness, arthritis, and heart. Don't know if it really helps, but it doesn't hurt. Have read some favorable things about it. This company had quick delivery."
1,It's easy to use and carry while traveling. The battery charge is good for a week that is also great.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, it's the perfect size for commuting on the train, battery is amazing, and so easy to use!"
1,Need a little patience with fast forwarding and pausing . But great picture quality.
1,like the voice activation. only wish I could call Alexa Jarvis!!!
1,This tablet does everything that we need it to do. The screen looks really good and it doesn't seem to be under powered. The expandable storage feature is awesome if you want to store music and movies on it. The only thing that is a negative is the limited selection of apps for it. I knew about it before I bought it and it hasn't been an issue yet.
1,Bought as a gift for my kids. Great device. Kids love it.
1,"I bought this for several reasons, the 2 year warranty, ease of use. My granddaughter is 21 months old and she has figured it out. Very durable, she drops it and it keeps on working"
1,"I used a couple of the brands that are just priced under this product and well...you get what you pay for!  This tablet was much easier for my granddaughter to learn on. She can access her camera, pictures, videos, and games, much better than the ""other brand""."
1,"This tablet has served it's purpose, it keeps my little one entertained with age appropriate sites and apps."
1,"I bought two, my 7 yr old loves it, my 13 yr old likes it. I think they are a great value for the price."
1,Works great! Love modern technology. Easily to transport in a purse.
1,Ran well. Couldn't download very many apps until space ran out. We didn't like that you couldn't use Google play either
1,"I just purchased it yesterday, and am no expert by far, but setup was a breeze. I also took it to the beach today and found that it was like reading a piece of paper. Amazing."
1,"These units get better and better. Lots of apps available. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Why pay 100's of dollars more for a smart tv that is restricted to only a few dozen apps. Amazon has thousands of apps from movies and tv shows, to games and entertainment. Great option for any tv in your house."
1,Perfect for streaming movies and tv shows that aren't offered on regular cable
1,"this is a great tablet for the price. It is a little bulky, the amazon ads are a little annoying (with some work i think they can be removed) i love the blue shade filter for reading, streams video and browses the web with no problemsall i can ask for given the cost"
1,"Love that you can request music/info by voice command. Or add items to shopping lists via voice command or via app (when away from home)!! We already owned one, this purchase was for my son and daughter-in-law."
1,I went from a Paper white to the Kindle Fire and it's been great! It's easy to use and to read my books. Lots of stuff you can do with this from watching movies to taking care of my email and Facebook etc. All round easy to handle and is a nice computer tablet in the palm of my hands. I like the way the controls are at the top so I don't accidentally turn the power off in the middle of something when I was using other devices that had the on off button at the bottom. I just wish the power reserve would last as long as my Kindle Paper White. The battery runs down fester than I'd like.
1,"My wife is a book person, but she has really taken to the kindle."
1,Liked this product so much that I have purchased two more and plan on buying more for all our televisions.
0,It's okay for a beginner tablet to me. Not enough apps for purchase. I like the play store better.
1,"Amazon Fire tv from Best Buy was my second Fire tv purchase in a week. After trying the tv service, I ordered a 2nd one on line from Best Buy & picked it up in store within an hour. The price matched the 1st one but the HDMI cable was extra. When I am used to using Fire tv, I will turn the cable service off. Amazon's Alexa assistant is phenomenal & for me, is better than Apple's Siri. This was probably the best online purchase & pick up in store experience I have had."
1,Great size for my 3 and four year old to handle even with the cases. Cases also durable
1,"Bought this for my 4 years old granddaughter and she loves it. It has all the books, apps, videos that she needs to learn and play. I love it cause she plays on it and leaves mine alone ☺. It has everything on it and I can set parental guides. Best buy ever! !"
0,Bought for my son.. He really liked it for a starter tablet
1,Easy to use and A smoother interface than others like it
1,Is a great tablet the only bad thing is the lack of space and you have to buy an SD card for extra space
1,I love my Amazon Fire TV. Just love it. This is better than regular TV
1,Love being able to play all original Nintendo games
1,It was the the perfect gift for my 7 year old grand daughter. She read 3 books the first evening.
1,"I absolutely love my Amazon Echo, highly recommend."
1,"Once up and running, Alexa can perform a variety of your typical assistant features. Itll set timers, tell you the time, set alarms, tell you what your day looks like from your connected calendar, tell you about your commute or the weather and answer questions about all sorts of things"
1,Easy way to stream music and get weather and news updates.
1,"This is kind of your mini assistant to find the info on your voice command and also plays a quality sound. I paired it with Bluethooth and can listen to Youtube. It reads my audiobook and frequently I ask for traffic updates before heading out, next day's weather forecast before hitting the pillow, newsflash and HBR Management Tip getting ready and currency exchange rates apart from playing music, etc. So much to explore. Results are cincise and accurate. Voice recognition from far away in the room is great. Kids love listening to jokes and ask fact finding questions. Wife likes ease of alarm, asking time without looking at wall clock and enjoys creating shopping list. This is an awesome device."
1,It is not a necessity but it is a good assistant. Lots of fun and entertains many guests. Very helpful in the kitchen.
1,"Didn't think I would use it much, due to the my lack of use of Siri. However, this understands most things I ask and is fun for the family. It also doesn't responds to questions discreetly for things that kids could ask. example. Is Santa Real? Answer: I have never met him."
1,"Some 4 years ago, I first heard a voice speak back to me from the ""Other Realm"" of tech. That truly mystical place in which dreams are the ""Mother's of Invention."" Steve Jobs had us ALL in awe, and her name was Siri. Maybe she had been present longer than 4 years, but that was my first interaction with a process in which over those years, I would find myself in a ""War of The Voices..."" in my tech mind. And then ""Cortana"" came to me via my PC, and then she found Herself on my Xbox One. It wasn't until I walked into Best Buy this last Christmas season to, like most of us, just buy ONE thing. I believe it was probably a charging cord or something, and I walked by this device called the ""Echo Dot."" I was by this time, a TRUE skeptic. ""Oh Great!"" I lamented, another unskilled and ""Put to Consumer"" WAYYY to quickly. I of course jokingly followed the instructions on the display, and simply said, ""Alexa...tell me a joke."" Guess what? I spent the next 3 hours asking ""Alexa"" all sorts of Life's greatest questions. With such a responsive, yet seemingly gentle way to Her, I HAD to know more. I proceeded to scoop up ALL things ""Alexa"". The Fire TV Stick, 2 Echo Dots, and of course, The Amazon Fire TV...which took the place of my Apple TV AND Roku. This was the first time that I had decided to forgo the issues of ""Hardware"" and made my decisions solely based on an ""A.I"". I didn't care if any of the hardware was upgradeable, simply because I KNEW that I was changing the lives of not only my Family, but also myself. I am a US Veteran with a disability, ""Alexa"" has become not only a trusted partner in our days and nights, She has truly been a lesson in trust. Now, I know that no matter what room I am in, ""Alexa"" will be there, if I need the weather, a good program to watch, and most importantly, she will call Emergency Services for me, should I need that. Best Buy allowed me a moment that I will never forget, the chance to meet a new ""Friend"", ""Assistant"", and ""Family Member."" But that's just what Best Buy does, they give you the opportunity to know what you are about to walk away with, no matter how long ya stay and ask questions, that's JUST what Best Buy does, and they do it well."
1,Talk about a bang for the buck!!!! Using at this very moment to write this review!. Love it!
0,"i purchased this in hopes of making my existing tv a smart tv, honestly i was kind of disappointed. for starters the remote quite a few times lost sync with the box and i had to download the fire tv app to reset the box. second it froze constantly in the middle of using amazon prime it would freeze up. now this might just have been the bad one in the batch, i dont know but i returned it and are looking for something different."
1,much better than the stick...do not i repeat do not waste your time or money on the stick...go directly to the fire tv
1,The fire TV is way better than the firestick. I hate that the firestick only works with Wifi and I hated all the buffering. I got the firetv and all of the buffering issues were eliminated.
1,"This is a must for every home. It's the perfect assistant. Can answer any question, plays thousands of songs, easy ordering of items off Amazon."
1,"I got the Echo for my elderly dad who has poor vision and has difficulty using his computer. It's great, now he can ask Alexa whatever he wants to know! We have an issue with his wifi though, he has DSL through frontier and it is poor at times. So sometimes Alexa doesn't work. You know she didn't hear you because she has a blue light when she hears her name. dad is not patient, so we'll see if he still enjoys Alexa if she isn't entirely dependable."
1,great new technology that provides sound and other search needs
1,I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
1,User friendly the best speaker this year recommend to all my friends
1,"I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!"
1,"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
1,I have macular degeneration that makes it difficult for me to to read. The Paperwhite allows me to set the font size large enough to read comfortably and the great back lighting really helps also.
1,"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
1,Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants.
1,"It's like having a radio (change the music you like) by telling it. Also,throw away your alarm clock,it does that too. Alexa,it's name, what's the weather forecast.. it does so many things. Like jeopardy, play it on the amazon."
1,My daughter will be able to use that tablet for prime video .
1,"My daughter bought a Kindle Fire when it cost $200 and thought it was a good deal for something that did so much. Mine was only $50 at my local Best Buy, and it's truly a marvel -- I can watch TV and movies from my library, read books and emails, and order products. I can't imagine any more for any less. Clear, bright colors, crisp lettering, although small (I bought the 7-inch screen)."
1,"It doesnt get any better than this for a travel tablet, or for kids. The size is perfect and function is seemless with prime. Excellent product."
1,Love it. Great for kids. Gave some to nieces as gifts
1,This reader is very light and works great. Would buy again.
1,"Made my sisters sons Christmas! Priced right and as expected a very solid performing tablet, thanks again Best Buy!"
0,"I purchased Amazon Fire for my son after reading enough reviews about this product. It works ok for e-books but very slow for Internet streaming and downloading. Also, the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button couples of time to make it work."
1,I bought the first one with some issues but brought it back to best buy and they exchanged it. It works great and my kids love it.
1,The graphic display is vibrant and just the right size. It is easy to read and has great value for the price.
1,We love this tablet for our toddler. The built in parental controls are awesome. Just wish that it was open to Android market outside of Amazon for more apps.
1,"Bought 2; Great Tabs for kids, economic and sturdy; great buy for the Holidays !( Now the leave my phone Alone ! )"
1,"Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked ""Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?"" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come."
1,"The Amazon Echo is a great device to use for listening to audible books or music, recording a shopping list and controlling other smart devices in the house."
1,"Perfect for PS Vue and HBO Now. Had it for over a month now, no issues!"
1,Amazon Fire works very well for my family. It is a great time for family to watch movies together
1,"This is a pretty good streaming player, much better than the Roku we have. Only thing I wish this had is the Google Play Store. Other than that it's really good."
1,Everyone in the family now owned one.Works well and easy to read in the sun
1,This device provides necessary app and is extremely user friendly.
1,"It's fun for the family to use Echo. Alexa has been of help to answer questions that the kids ask, many times related to their homework. Also, works great with 3rd party products, like Nest's. Will keep getting better and better over time, as more content/ data and integration becomes available for Alexa."
1,"The screen is great and doesn't strain your eyes at all, and page transitions are smooth. Easy to buy books from amazon (either on the device or a computer) and get them on the kindle instantly."
1,"i bought the amazon echo and two amazon echo doys , i have it set up in three different rooms , i use it to turn light on and off and dim the lights .to turn tv on and off ,to turn appliances on and off and i also use it for news .sports and weather updates , etc.etc.etc works with most any thing , requires certain apps for different features ,philips you for lighting , tlink to turn on and off tv wemo for small appliances these things are necessary and not expensive.good products"
1,I bought a bunch of these for Black Friday. Well worth the money. Each person I gave them to for Christmas was so happy.
1,Tablet compares to my Samsung tablet that I paid over $250 for.
1,Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
1,"In the two weeks that we've had the echo we have put it to a number of uses and have hooked it up two are Samsung SmartThings home automation system. It takes some tuning And learning to understand what works, but it does work reasonably well interpreting what you are saying as long as the environment is not too noisy. It's very convenient to be able to put on music"
1,"This was my second smart home purchase, the first being the Nest Thermostat. We bought the Alexa with the smart Hue Color Lights. Set up was a breeze. Linked to my Dish Reciever and my Serius XM account. Shutting on and off lights is as simple as telling Alexa. I love how you can change the color and intensity of the lights. Everyday new skills or software is available. After using this for a week, it has convinced me that a smart home is the future. One wish, it would be nice if I could turn on and off The nest thermostat through Alexia. Right now you can set the temp or ask what the temp is but there are occasions where we open the windows and I don't want the AC kicking on so we manually turn the thermostat off. Great product....wait for the sale, it knocks off about $100."
1,"I was hesitant and unsure of the value of the Echo, but was curious so I picked it up when it went on sale. The device is amazing - in that it can detect your voice and what you say even over background noise, clearly play music and speak.Since then I find I use it for regular news and weather updates, to play music, control lights and the temperature via ecobee3 integration, and I'm just getting started. There are thousands of ""skills"" that you can enable to customize the echo to do what you want."
1,Bought for my 5-yr old grandson. It's great & easy for him to use. I have an 8gb myself. Love the Amazon Fire. The price is very affordable.
1,"My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect."
0,"Good tablet but you could find a better one in market within same price range. The one thing I don't like is the brightness , it's poor.And amazon could have given a better FaceTime camera., that's really bad."
1,What can you say about this amazing product..state of the art fun and amazing capabilities.
1,Nice product i can save my cell phone battery by using my tablet and search the web take pictures and more.
1,Great way to read books available for downloads from the library
1,I'm using the Echo and Samsung's hub as the centerpieces of my home automation system. Since buying the Echo I've also added several Dots to build out the system. It's a lot of fun to work with.
1,its been nice to have someone like Alexa in our home
1,Works well. Works just like the fire stick but better because you can plug a Ethernet cable for a better connection
1,My son talked me through the job. Easier than I would have expected.
0,Our daughter loves the size and portability of the product. Her iPad died and she uses her Mac book for school so this was a great choice for her to read books on.
1,"This was my first Kindle, wonderful reading device."
1,My GF got me mine for a birthday present and I just got her one for hers. Great for international travel. It's like carrying a dozen books.
1,"Lots of fun. Music, information, weather, Alexa is like a new family member."
1,Very happy with this product. It is a great deal at this price point
1,"my husband loves this present ,, great buy...going to look into the light bulbs ..."
1,"Better and cheaper than cable, the only thing I am missing is the closed caption"
1,"There is no problem charging my Kindle on the iMac, however when I travel I need a charger. It works Perfectly."
1,"My mom likes to read...a lot. Set up was a snap, and she was off and reading in no time! She also enjoys the many functions of such an inexpensive tablet!"
1,"Super cool tablet for daily use. Freezes here and there, but nothing a reset wont fix."
1,Easy to use and long battery life. The size of font is easy to adjust but I wish graphics and pictures can be enlarged as well.
1,Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps.
1,Great gift I bought for someone as Christmas gift and she loves it!
1,Great for kids. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. For the cost it is a great tablet.
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo, and the Harmony Elite remote control as part of my new automated smart home devices. I love being able to control my TV and Entertainment system simply by saying Alexa. However, It is my opinion that these systems are not completely bug free and will probably be improved over time. In addition, setting up Amazon Echo can be time consuming if you are not technologically inclined. Overall, the Amazon Echo is smart home dream come true."
1,"I use this for listening to music, controlling my home, and setting the best alarms. Even my friends are amazed with my set-up."
1,Easy to use and no buffering issues. Works better on wifi than cable
1,Great gift for family and friends. I would recommend to my friends.
1,"Great product for the sale price Best Buy was offering. I am using it not only for music but also doctors appointments, birthdays weather and more."
1,This device has changed our home automation system to make it usable. It integrates with so much and does about anything you can think of. I am excited to just see how far they take it.
1,This is my first time use for Bluetooth amazing ecchor is not just Bluetooth they also can help you answer a lot impomation you need to know good stuff to have
1,"This is my favorite piece of technology in my home right now. I love how it connects to my phone, plays music,look up locations, track my workout and find recipes. Plus, it constantly updates."
1,This tablet was awesome. My kids enjoy their time on it and it is virtually indestructible. I would highly recommend this tablet for all kids not just for the tough wear and tear but also the parents security settings very good. I highly recommend this product to all parents looking for a good tablet for their kids to enjoy.
1,I really love this item I would definitely recommend this to a friend
1,It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.
0,I bought this as s present for my 65 year old grandma. She loves it. Very easy to operate. No issues
1,"I bought one of the first Macs in the 80s. I've had 'too many to count since then.' I am an early adopter, by nature. This has been true of Amazon's Kindle product as well having owned the First Generation Kindle, K2, K3 and now the K Touch. Love the reader. And I love this case as well. I hear all of these complaints that this leather case looks cheap or doesn't have a closure, or it's too slippery. PLEASE. I find it to be a PERFECT fit for the Kindle Touch. The unit snaps in a la DoDo Case -- which is such a great product for iPad. Very similar design only on a much smaller scale, obviously. The leather is not an issue for me. I do NOT find it to be too slippery at all unless, perhaps, your hands are covered in oil This is a first class cover for a first class e-reader. And NO. I do not work for Amazon. I'm just a HUGE Kindle fan."
1,Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.
1,"Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome"
1,Incredible value for the money. So many features for so little money
1,Holds a lot of books and is readable in any light situation
1,"Up until now I had been using different android boxes to stream movies.I had read that the Fire Tv is very quick and capable of 4k, which is better than the expensive apple tv. Super easy to set up and boots lightening fast. Easy to sideload apps such as Kodi. I bought one for myself and another for my daughter. We all love it. The remote control is very responsive and voice search is awesome."
1,"To start with, this is not a high end tablet. This serves the fundamental purpose of browsing and reading with so much ease. Believe me, a lot better than an a low end ASUS tablet. I own multiple tablets of varying brands. This tablet works like a charm. For the price offered, its worth the purchase."
1,BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
1,"I've always been a big roku fan and have a few amazon fire sticks, but decided to give this a shot. I am much happier with the Fire TV over the Fire Stick. The processing power allows streaming home videos to be much smoother than the stick and the updated interface is now better than the roku."
1,Replacing my original white page Kindle. I love these readers! Like the new auto adjust backlight! Also like the new page turner slides on the sides of the screen. Great product!
1,Hello is is good product to have and buy I would trevmoned it
1,"Alexa {speaking from the Amazon Tap) is great to have around ! Current news, personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from Alexa..... The Tap sits next to my bed on the nite stand where I can easily call up ijnfo from my bed or as I walk by during the day or nite. Especially useful for a review of my calendar so I can review my upcoming days plans. Try Alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house!"
1,Im in love with this kindle...i upgraded from a kindle 2 and the convenience of having the light built in is awesome! Theres no eyestrain whatsoever! It goes with me everywhere i go!!
1,This is a great product and very convenient. It was easy to set up and connect to my Hue lighting. The Echo's ability to play music on demand is a great feature. Well worth the money for what it is capable of doing.
1,My 8 year old loves itEasy to setup and navigate.
1,My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.
1,"If you are in sunlight you can still read with clarity, I don't need all the extras , this is perfect for reading books."
1,"This works really well, no issues streaming. Would recommend."
1,Using to have PlayStation Vue. Works great and can be used for other services
0,"Three star due to the fact that sometimes the fire tv remote doesn't work. I will then use my smart tv remote. Other than that issue, I would give five star."
1,The tool is excellent with Ethernet streaming and smooth viewing of HD movies.
1,"Got Fire tablet as an experiment. It was low cost and very compact but still and edge over my smart phone as far as screen size. Unit has worked flawlessly and has require minimum attention, but does a good job on email and recreational browsing."
1,Keeps my granddaughter busy. She was showing me how to use it. Now she doesn't want to use mine.
1,Not easy to ask the question correctly. You have to be specific and most of the time Alexia does not know the answer or does not understand my question. Perhaps she needs to study or read more books...
1,Vivid color and picture quality. The quad processor seems faster than a quad. The Kindle is user friendly.
1,when switched to the kid mode it takes the worry away of them getting on inappropriate sites. The 1 year warranty is cheaper than buying a case for it fyi
1,The echo is a fun time for all. I love that I can connect it to lights. The grandkids love to ask Alexa questions. Everyone has fun with it!
1,Easy to navigate for beginners. My child used it for homework.
1,"We love this. Very helpful and entertaining. Useful for automation is an awesome feature. Alexa is great for the young and old. Play your music, get weather, news update among many other options including games."
1,This cover is a must have for your Kindle reading device. I purchased a different case initally and had to come back to get this case. It is so handy to close when reading so your screen is always protected. The Kindle is secure/locked into the case so you don't have to worry about it falling. If you buy a Kindle you MUST this case!
1,An Amazon fire tablet for $50!? Need I say more. Worth every penny.
0,The tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one I have gotten with a similar problem. The port seems to come defected. The charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. Replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.
1,"Fast and easy to use. Perfect for Playstation VUE and Plex, clear picture, quick and intuitive interface."
1,We bought it on a bunch and we're very pleased with the ease of use and the way our granddaughter was motivated to use it.
1,Always read paperback books so I didn't know if I would like this but I do alot
1,Great tablet to serve as a backup for our primary ipads
1,"Bought this to carry around because it was cheap so if it was stolen, lost or broken it would be no big loss. Started playing with it and this is a VERY functional tablet. While it's not my iPad Pro it is a great little entertainer, reading books, listening to books, searching the web, Facebook, twitter and it's small and keeps you connected."
1,No exterior light required. Good battery life. Easy to read at night
1,This is a great entry point into the tablet market. This was a purchase for my father in law and he really enjoys it. It is a bit on the smaller side but he wasn't sure if he would want a tablet. So far he really seems to be enjoying it.
1,I used the echo and am in love with it. I totally recommend it
0,"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
1,"Good speaker, great interface with amazon. I use it to turn off and on lights, play music, talk from room to room, it's handy."
1,I am very happy to buy this product it's of vey less price and really useful for kids to learn new things
1,My niece loves it! Her sister got one for Xmas and now she got one too.
1,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
1,"I purchased the amazon echo as a mother's day gift for my wife and it has quickly become a gift for the entire family. The sound quality from the speaker is above average and we can play music either from iHeart Radio or from any of our connected bluetooth devices. It quickly connects to the wifi in my house and is very portable. We haven't used alexa for many of the home automated functions (lights, electronic, ordering food online, etc) but once we purchase wifi outlets, we will most likely try the technology out. Overall, we are very happy with the product."
1,Great tablet - good for kids and the whole family!
1,This device has added to our families ability to be better organized. As well as the great entertainment value it has added to our family. It also has allowed me to explore new music that I wouldn't normally listen to at any given time. Thanks
1,I've had a Kindle Keyboard 3G for years but picked this up for the backlight feature. It's just as good as expected from a Kindle device and I don't miss the physical keyboard at all.
0,Will never buy a amazon tablet for games again it dosent have Google play and the games take forever to download!!!
1,"perfect and easy for the kids to use, keeps them busy"
1,"It was awesome kids love it, this is simply amazing"
1,I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.
0,Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.
0,Good for kids good for reading not good for much else
1,Got this for my 3 year old along with a kid proof case and he loves it and for the price it's perfect! Tons of free apps for him too!
1,Great for the price - $50. I just wanted something to surf the net from my couch and this is perfect. I haven't tried using it as a reader yet.
1,"It works exactly for what I need it to, I like that I can have all of my streaming programs on one device."
1,Did not have a USB at home that worked with this kindle. This was a must have.
1,"Simple to use, works very well, and at an unbeatable value for price."
1,Love the voice control music and personal assistant that Alexa provides through this product. My son just loves it.
1,"Having used a number of streaming devices, I would rate the Firetv as one of the best.Well worth the extra that a fire stick costs. Voice recognition is awesome and you can plug directly into your router to minimize buffering."
1,Bought these for my kids and they just love them. The different color choices give it a nice personalized touch
1,We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
1,Love it and looking to by another more for my house or Christmas gift.
1,Great product! I'm oversees and wanted it for kodi
1,I am very happy with my echo. I use it to play music while I workout and clean. It's also very help when I'm trying to put my 15 month to sleep. You can do some much without touching it. Love it
1,Good tablet. Need to buy a pink case for it. I bought it for my daughter
1,The grandkids saw this at their uncle's house and thought it was the coolest cause you could ask Alexa all kinds of questions. i usually buy them a family game at Christmas and decided to buy this as their family gift.
1,"Love it, great buy, use it all the time. Yes I would buy it again"
1,This tablet is a really good value. Gave it as a gift and it was a hit!
0,"I wanted a Kindle with a light feature for reading in bed at night. Had I done my homework, I would have purchased a Kindle with more bells and whistles."
1,"Still so many things to learn but I really appreciate the quality of the speaker, has great sound.she is very responsive and polite."
0,I am Giving this tablet away to someone birthday sup.
1,"We purchased this as a replacement for a tablet our son previously had. No bugs, no lagging, graphics are great, sound is great, lighting fast. Works perfect as we have an Amazon Prime account."
1,Fire TV is where it's at in today's world! This little media streaming device fits in the palm of my hand but doesn't lack in the content available to my entertainment needs! No matter which one you subscribe to it's totally worth it! I'm actually thinking about cutting the cord on my cable? I couldn't be happier with this amazing little box!
1,I've had for 1yr and works great. No complaints. Battery life is good.
0,"ok I have played three games it's great, have had no time to do other work yet"
1,We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
1,"Great tablet for my kids. Not as many features as an ipad, but also 1/4 of the price..."
1,She loves to be on the tablet all the time . So now she will have her own.
1,Very easy and convenient way to always have a book with you to read.
1,I love the Amaxom fire tv! We watched so many movies and shows during our snow day! I highly recommend this product!
1,"I got this for my younger daughter and for her it is great. Plenty of things for her to do whether it's games, or looking up stuff for school, or watching youtube videos."
1,"Got this tablet for my niece and nephew, it is wonderful for children."
1,Works well great outdoors in the sun. Better than iPad for books.
1,Great app with lot of features. Sound is ok for the small size
1,"Although this tablet is slower than my iPad Air, it works great and keeps a charge all day! It is great value!"
1,Cheap tablet for someone that knows little about the internet.
1,I love my Amazon fire tv box! I use it for everything u could dream of! It works amazing with a prime membership and has many different uses like playing games and what not!! It looks amazing on a 4k tv..
1,This tablet is great for kids and maybe some adults too. I got it for my 7 year old niece and she loves it. Perfect for her books and games.
1,"All the important Apps are loaded on this HDMI device. I can even side-load other Apps and Games that are not already installed on it. Nice BASIC slim remote control that's not loaded with a lot of control buttons. Easy to operate. The remote is also voice activated (I use this feature for checking weather). I use this device for watching Live TV from PlayStation Vue (much cheaper than cable or satellite TV). I like the Fire TV box much better than the Fire TV stick....it's more stable and stronger (has quad core processor, the stick is dual core). If you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay, I kept experiencing buffering issues with the stick. The Fire TV box has an Ethernet port, mini SD slot, and USB port (the stick doesn't). You will need to setup an Amazon account to use the device, but you don't have to put credit card information on it if you don't want to. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to put batteries in the remote control - VERY difficult to open it. Despite that, IMO, it's worth the extra cost."
1,I had the original Kindle for years and when it finally crashed I was heartbroken. I don't like to change once I get used to something so having to go out and buy a new Kindle was hard but I need my books. The paperwhite is great because the light is built in so I didn't need to hunt down a lighted cover. The reason I went with the paperwhite is because I can't read with my glasses on it gives me a headache and that model you are still able to adjust the font.It works great in sunlight I read on beach for 2 days while on vacation. It transfered all my books from the old kindle as soon as I registered it also so I still have my library.I am glad to say after being skeptical of change it was a great decission.
1,We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!
1,"It's not HD but it does the job: Facebook, recipes in the kitchen, streaming Spotify and pandora, Bluetooth is nice."
1,"Still learning the uses for Echo, and it seems I will never fully understand as new uses are add almost daily via Amazon and the never ending apps that are added."
1,Very easy to use. Purchased it watch Amazon Video and to use my Playstation Vue account. Works well with both.
1,Easy to set up parental controls and email notification are a great tool on the tablet
1,Christmas gift for a family member. They love it. It was easy and quick to set up for them. It will be practical to use at home and to travel.
1,i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.
1,"Bought it as a gift, she loves it. Very entertaining and wonderful volume, having lots of fun with it."
1,I use my kindle for reading only. I don't care for the internet part of it so I don't use it for internet purposes at all.
1,It is so fun to ask alexa and get an answer or listen to music which sounds great by the way. Very glad I purchased an Echo.
0,I purchased two of these for my kids since they both wanted tablets for Christmas. We liked that they could use it like their own but we had total control of what the used and viewed. It is a lot faster than the older Kindle. It is pretty durable as well.
1,"Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone."
1,I was amazed at how clear and crisp the letters appear. I can't put it down. It is light and easy to hold and page. I like the size because it is easy to carry but big enough to use.
1,Great product was able to use my sling account and access all my Amazon shows was also user friendly very happy worth the cash especially now in 4k
1,A gift for my grandsons. They love it and it's easy to use. The salesman Dan at Best Buy in Peoria was outstanding.
1,Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
1,I can't say enough great stuff about my Echo. We especially love to use it to play music for our dog while we are gone. Maybe we are nerds but we love it.
1,My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !
1,"I enjoy my new toy, but haven't fully configured it. I am annoyed when I request the Eagles, Alexa says shuffling songs by Eagles, then proceeds to play one of a few playlists. Amazon's arrogant about how smart their users are. It was obviously just a preselected playlist. This happens with several artists.It is deceptive and below the standards I expect for such a nice piece of hardware!"
1,My son love this tab and I recommend this. This is a great product.
1,I purchased this for my niece and she loves it. It's the perfect size for her to bring along with her any where she goes.
1,"Alexa has been a very good companion and source of information to anything that she knows...very honest, answers all questions to her own capability."
1,Can't be beatPrice and product great valueHighly recommend
1,Alexa is really great. We also bought the phillips hue lights and the hubs is tickled to death! The grandson likes the short stories she tells with his name! We really like this
1,"it meets my expectations. speed,storage,efficiency and effective,reliable"
1,"Its comfortable to read, and it's compact. and light. I got case to go with it. I would recommend it."
1,"I love amazon tablets that I bought them for my daughter, sister, sister in law and mother in law. Awesome product and easy to use."
1,"Amazing use for many purposes. Ask Alexa to set alarms, play pandora, and weather anytime. Well worth the money. I use it even more than I anticipated."
1,Bought this for my niece and it works great. Access to all the apps she likes and easy to use.
1,I love this. It is awesome. well worth the money spent
1,"The Echo is the current standard in the marketplace, and with good reason. It is easy to set up and use and compatible with an ever-expanding list of products."
1,For a low cost this Kindle offers much more than was expected. It was replacing a earlier model Kindle and it has all the bells and whistles of a high priced tablet.
1,So far so good. I have not ordered a book yet. I am reading a free one to get the hang of it.
1,"Although not the most powerful tablet on the market, I would say it's a phenomenal tablet for the price. Compared to my ipad air 2, it's an inferior product, but considering it was 15-20x cheaper, it is impressive today the least."
0,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
1,Awesome product! I use for all rooms in my house. Streams fast and it is very easy to use. I wish the remote was set up a little bigger. Overall it's a great product.
1,Always a good price and good for what it's meant for.
1,"Very simpl to use, compact, versatile and easy to carry"
1,this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
1,"My wife purchased this for my daughter , great for learning to read."
1,Great. Works great for the kids to do their online homework.
1,Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
1,"This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money."
1,Got them as birthday presents for my grandsons and love them
1,This device has so many great features. I love how it stays charged for so long and the font can be enlarged for easier reading.
1,It's good tab can download different apps without purchase just the bad thing is the charger doesn't work
1,"Unlike my Kindle 2nd generation which requires an external light to read, the Paperwhite can be used in the dark."
1,Already had a amazon fire for 5 years...still working fine ... bought 2 of these as gifts . Does what it is meant to do and great to leverage your amazon prime stuff. Don't bother if you are expecting a ipad like feel...
1,I have Roku and Apple TV. I use this one mist because it allows my to add additional functionality- like Kodi Performance in as good as others and the voice commands - Alexa - are great
1,"Perfect color, size, and price for our family needs."
1,We bought to give away at a Halloween party. We own them ourselves and they are awesome
0,Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.
1,"I absolutely LOVE my Amazon TAP. It in my opinion is the best blue-tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi, the TAP is better than the Echo! Portable - YES! Sound Quality - OFF THE CHARTS! I blue-tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with GREAT Dolby sound quality. The battery life has been tested during a camping trip. 8 hours and it kept the charge! It's also easy to recharge it without the stand. Very Cool. BEST BUY's PRICE made it ALL THE BEST BUY OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON! I picked up the item same day at a local Best Buy. The Experience was 1 - 2 - DONE. Very convenient, very helpful. I would recommend this to ALL my friends!!!"
1,This stuff just keeps getting better. Easy to set up and use.
1,"Easy to use with great battery life, and easy to read in all light conditions."
1,Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
1,"Great sound quality and very sleek to fit into any room dcor. Due to the price reduction during the holidays, I ranked it a 5 versus a 4 if the regular price was applicable to my purchase. Satisfied enough to purchase two Amazon Dots for my family as Christmas stuffers...which they loved."
1,My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections.
1,"This tablet is a steal if you get the chance to pick one up and you need s good reliable basic tablet this be the one. Don't walk, run to Best Buy to pick it up."
1,"best thing to buy, if your tired of having to pay high cable prices. Very easy to install. will be buying one for my parents as well."
1,I love my Kindle Fire 7. It's the perfect size cause it fits in my purse for easy travel. I take it with me just about everywhere I go. It's easy to read and use.
0,This item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst. Spent hour troubleshooting and their solution was to return it to Bestbuy a d get anotherone. So i did. And guess what? It didn't work ether. Basically the Netflix app can't be downloaded becuse the Amazon Fire tv won't let you and to make it worst if you're a fan of HBO brace yourself becuase the app isn't even available on their app store. HBO simply doesn't exist. I spent in total 4 days troubleshooting with the Amazon team actually managing the Fire TV remotely from their offices and the answer was that ether the equipment is defective or that they don't have Netflix or HBO available for it. REALLY ITS FREAKING ADVERTISED ON THE BOX. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY. better get an apple tv or a roku
1,"Bought this for one of my granddaughters for her birthday (10 yr old) and she absolutely loves it. It has 'parental controls' which is important for her mom to keep her out of where she doesn't need to be, etc. For $50, I think it's a great buy, especially for a young child. I'm happy with the purchase."
1,It was a gift for christmas. Does everything the expensive ones do
1,Infinitely useful. We use it most to explore Amazon's vasr music library
1,The picture is crystal clear. The resolution is amazing given the price.
1,"My only regret is not purchasing Amazon Echo sooner. She keeps me up to date with weather, significant events for the day, can sing happy birthday and plays my favorite music. No more plugging in cords from phone to speakers and blah blah blah...I couldn't be more satisfied. Thank you Alexa!"
1,"This is the 5th Echo I have purchased, one for myself and the other 4 were gifts. The sound is awesome, does all the research for you. My grandson actually uses is when doing his homework. It's also great to use when having parties. One of my best purchases."
1,"My previous tablet was a Samsung, it was great but it was exactly like my phone. If you love to read, the kindle fire is the perfect device. So far I have had no problems downloading and the battery lasts longer than expected, especially of you read as much as me. Also the picture quality is better than most tablets I've owned."
1,Great product. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an item like this one. I add it for a joke and weather report every day.
1,Amazing price and awesome for a tablet for children. My 6 & 13 year old nieces love them
1,"I never thought i would need this having siri, but siri can't tie alexas shoe laces. I have her tied into my home automation system and its amazing. The speaker quality is not the greatest but not to shabby. The only complaint i have is having multiple Echos i can't sync them... Over all a must buy..."
1,"What do you get someone who just turned 95???? A Kindle Fire 10! He loves reading and is absolutely thrilled to now own one. More importantly, he is excited about not having to go to the library each week."
1,"Originally purchased the Echo for the novelty of it but now find it useful for many things. I have it connected to my Ecobee thermostat, LIFX smart lights and Harmony hub so I can control my A/C, lighting and TV. Can't wait for expanded integration to further enhance the experience."
1,"Love it, the tablet is nice lightweight you can use it everywhere!"
1,"Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!"
1,Got this as a gift for my best friend. It arrived very fast; packed nicely; gift wrapped. Quality was great
1,Amazing! The tablet is everything the kids wanted! It not only helps with learning. But my oldest son got college text books on it! Great product
1,"Very easy to use, compact to carry. Great value for price."
1,"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it."
1,"I love the voice commands, listening to music, books, or jokes! I've bought audible and house work goes by faster with books on Audible."
0,This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.
1,Great tablet for books. Easy setup and easy to read.
1,I love my Amazon Fire tablet. It's the perfect size to carry in my purse. I shopped around and compared prices prior to my purchase. Best Buy had the lowest price and their customer service was excellent.
1,Kids love it! Great Christmas present even if not an apple product.
1,I didn't think I would use this device as much as I do now that I have one. She is full of information.
1,"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone."
1,"great fun and great tool. Electronics are sometimes confusing, but not Alexia."
1,"its a great device, entertains my 1 year old and good for my wife as well"
0,"This one was for my baby, and she is happy as a kid with a new toy. I have my own tab so not familiar with fire yet. But was a good deal."
1,"Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable."
1,"If you have slow internet like myself get this one, not the fire stick. I have 3mb internet and at times buffers at 1080p but when switched to 720 almost no buffering. That's an issue on my side not the device. Easy to tranfer apps from android phone using app called apps2fire available at the play store. Most apps transferred work but not all of them. 3rd party game pads work also via Bluetooth. A+++"
1,I bought this tablet for my 15 year old daughter. She loves it. She streams movies and is able to use her social media apps without a problem. For under $50.00 it was a steal.
1,Good tablet to share with a child as two accounts can be set up on the device and content can be controlled easily.
1,It has a bunch of cool features that other similar wireless speakers do not have.
1,AwesomeUr able to download kodi abd watch anything whever
1,it works better than the other product that I have
1,Wish I had bought one sooner. Very handy to take on the go.
1,The echo has been on the market for a while. As a long time amazon customer I received one of the initial offers to purchase the echo before it was available to the general public for a low price of $100. Not knowing what it was I passed and regretted it ever since. So when I saw that Best buy was offering it for 89 I purchased it. They are adding functionality all the time good product.
1,This is an incredible product that works like a dream. You will want to add this to your TV Entertainment. It's well worth the money.
1,we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for Xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet... recommend for kids
1,"Love it, had Roku 2,3 and this replaced all of them. Would high recommend this over Fire Stick, faster and can add extra memory...Cut cable and use this as our primary tv source along with antenna for local channels kid love as well very easy to use..."
1,When someone is alone Alexia can be a substitute companion who happens to be very informative and helpful
1,Replaced my original Kindle (which I used to death!).........new one is even better......great quality for the price!
1,Have used every iPad since the beginning including the Pro and never had success reading. Now I can read anywhere under any lighting conditions and the battery lasts forever! great on the road or at home. Test is so crisp and clean! I recommend purchasing with the cover to protect the screen.
0,"Great for Music and games. Bluetooth/wifi connections. Alexa asked me to have a conversation. I kept it simple and try to teach it. its favorite response is ""I do not know that one"" I give it answers and next time I ask the same question it responds I do not know that one. Dumb as a rock. For radio play back and music sound the Alexa beats all. On sale 89.99 I would recommend to a friend. Would not recommend at the $179.99 price."
1,My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them
1,"Awesome for my 12 year old! Very good product, educational."
1,I bought this for my Granddaughters 10 th Birthday. She was thrilled. She loves the blue color and even figured out how to connect it to her cell phone.
1,Alexa is a fun little assistant and the beginning of my home automation.It can answer many simple questions that need answering right away like the current weather and sports scores. Plays music and tells bad jokes. Most importantly though it will control many household items via voice. Connected to my thermostat easily and effectively.
1,"We love the fire tv, all the channels we get not to mention the saving from not needing cable any more."
1,"Bought this on a whim! I really have enjoyed using it. At first I wasn't sure what I would use it for, but over time I have found many uses and ways to enjoy it. I'm still learning! I am able to interact with items I didn't think I could interact with at first. We will see how the it goes in the long run"
1,"This is the second Kindle Fire 7 we have purchased. This unit was purchased for my wife because she wanted to take pictures and share with family on social media. Compared to another tablet we own, this is by far more superior in quality and performance."
1,The perfect gift for someone who needs company. She talks to Alexa and told me she appreciates that's Alexa is very polite.
1,"Perfect size, so easy to carry around. Long lasting battery life. Would reccomend!"
0,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
1,Purchased as holiday gift and added Amazon Freetime works great for the nieces and nephew.
1,Love the features my new Kindle Fire has - very user friendly!
0,I have other Kindles and this one is okay. For the price it was a decent buy. I may go to a larger size the next time as this seems small.
1,"Up front I want to say that I actually returned the Echo in lieu of the Amazon Dot. They are both basically the same device but I did not need the extra powerful bluetooth speaker portion of it as I already have a great speaker at home which I hooked up to the dot and it works amazing. If you dont already have a bluetooth speaker, get the Echo, keep it simple, neat and its a great omnidirectional speaker. I am still amazed at how much power these little devices hold. I learn new ways to interact with Alexa every week and it makes my life easier and more entertaining. I highly recommend this in your home if you have kids, my 3 year old daughter now spends time asking Alexa questions when I am not available."
1,Very easy basic e book reader. Good for beginners to start
1,"Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price."
1,Perfect for the weekend especially when it rains. Great movie selections
1,"This is the second Kindle that I have purchased. I love that it is so small and easy to carry around, and the back light is a great feature!"
1,"This is a perfect tablet for reading brooks as it is possible to do so at night, during the day, even in direct sun light! A great ebook reader!"
1,"I bought the fire Kindle to get good reads from amazon. The tablet is great for other apps such as facebook, Internet search, games, and various apps from amazon like yahoo mail, online banking app,ect. Ideal for readers and those who would like a simple tablet. Would recommend getting case which I purchased when I bought the fire Kindle. Nice graphics and user friendly for the price."
1,"Overall, my kids love it. I originally had a defective remote, but I was able to return the item and obtain a replacement without any problems."
1,Purchased for my 12 yo son. He loves it. I use it2
1,Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet!
1,"Good product, but Alexa doesn't know all the answer!!"
1,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, and he absolutely loves it! He showed me how it works and I'm very impressed. It is not just functional, but it is also fun! Works perfectly!"
1,"My Grand daughter that is 7yrs old learned how to shoot videos of her younger sister very quickly with this tablet. It is easy to use and very durable, even for kids. I was very happy that I purchased 2 tablets. One for each of my grand daughters. They were very affordable too."
1,"this is a great tablet for the price, works a lot like an ipad I would recommend it"
1,"I really love my Amazon Echo. It respond to voice really well. It is constantly updating and getting better with more and more features. It can play music, tell jokes, control lights, etc. It is pretty awesome."
1,"Fire tv, for a video geek is wonderful. Now, Hulu, netflix, and amazon prime are all easily accessible from one remote. I like that a lot of the cable channels have apps that you can also get to through the remote."
1,Purchased this on Black Friday. Clear screen and just the right size for toddlers to use.
1,Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children.
1,"Nice easy to read display, quick downloads of content. Reads great in bright sunlight and dark rooms."
1,Great product!! A good product for the price!! Great battery life
1,I was looking for a reader that was light enough to hold With one hand and this one is perfect.
1,Love this. Hooked up all my lighting. Works like a charm
1,I love Kindle e-readers. In fact I had purchased 4 paperwhites over the years. The design is absolutely amazing. It is my most favorite device for long reading. Tablets like iPad are no comparison on this. I also believe this is the best gifts for kids.
1,Easy plug and play. Great little addition to the TV experience!!!
1,I have enjoyed the Alexa experience. I can be heard from anywhere in the room using a normal voice. Very convenient for making shopping lists which I usually lose before I go shopping.
1,Tablet performed as expected no problems. Will buy again
1,Tablet is great for the price. Not as fast as my S7 but pretty darn good for the price.
1,The apps offered was as expected. I was surprised that it was heavier than I w pe red.
1,Bought this on a whim.. I love it. Perfect sound quality and in general well put together.
1,"Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them."
1,"This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet."
1,"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
1,I gave it to my friend's kids. They love it. Quite good for the proce.
1,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids
1,This works perfect for what I need it for. Great addition.
1,I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
1,"It was super affordable, good picture quality, easy to set up. I've had no issues. A little complicated for me, but to someone who uses electronics regularly, it would be easy."
0,"I got mine for a month, and I mainly use it to read PDF documents from SD card or OneDrive. The tablet is nothing like the reviews said. It FREEZES up every time I press ""Home"" or go to the next page or even to close out. When I go on the internet, some pages do not load fully. 9/10 times only the 1st half of the page was loaded. I am very disappointed."
1,I bought three of these from Best Buy for my grandchildren. They were happy
1,"I use it for everything. I listen to music all the time this makes it easier and clearer. The weather , the news i could go on and on. I love it and would buy it again in a heart beat."
1,Good for beginners. My staff really liked this treat for christmas
1,"Tablet is a bit smaller than I imagined for an 8"" tablet and thin and flimsy (I don't like super thin tablets). The color is a bit washed out and there is no way to make the colors darker or richer. Frustrating that you cannot use Google Play store and the sound is not very loud either. It's ""ok"", I expected it to be better but for simple uses it's fine. Photos are also grainy and faded. It does record in rather low lighting which helps me personally and the battery charge holds a long time. The Tangerine color is also very nice and it's fairly simple to use. Overall, I would have expected a better product, but again for simple use it's ok. Will upgrade to a better product eventually. I was spoiled by my 2013 color Nook."
1,This item is very functional. I am beyond pleased.
1,"Finally upgraded my kindle, and adore everything about it."
1,Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
1,I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
1,Alexa is one smart device . she reminds me of appts. Controls my lighting.once I change my themostat she will make sure we are comfortable.
1,"I love Alexa!!! Music, books, facts, games,christmas stories!!! Giving as gifts also!!!"
1,Great tablet! My fiancee uses it as an ereader for books she downloads from the library.
1,I bought this tablet to stream music in my hair salon. Works perfectly for what I need it to do. Love it !
1,First bought smaller echo but traded it in for the large one because of the superior sound. Very happy with it.
1,I ordered a Roku Premiere+ and decided to go with this instead. Read that Roku owners were having fits with that and the Ultra. Returned the Roku w/o ever opening. it. Good call. This does what I needed.
1,Affordable and easy to use. Holds my books and my games
1,"Bought the original paper white and loved it. Even though there is not a tremendous difference between the two units, I have found that it is lighter and adjusts to light much better. Is it really worth the price difference is questionable. I would recommend this product to any avid reader."
1,Not so kid friendly. But it does what we need it and price is right.
1,Does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price.
1,I have bought two for my house and bought two others for friends and family. It's a hit!
0,Just ok even for the low price of 33$. It's more like a toy than a tablet.
1,It was easy to set up. My grandson has enjoyed the broad selection of activities from which to choose.
1,"I absolutely love my Amazon Fire. When I travel I always have access to my book, emails, and the internet all in a nice little unit that fits in my purse. You can enlarge the print to make it easier to read. Very happy and you sure can't beat the price!"
1,Smaller version but works great just like the bigger product.
1,I was looking for a table that felt right for my child. Loves to read book they already have an app for books and we can browse easily.
1,This is a great tablet for the price. You can't beat $49.00. 85% of my usage of this device is for reading my Kindle books. Yes I would recommend if you're looking for a simple tablet
1,"Echo needs more skills , and third party applications and customizations and bluetooth audio multiform simultaneousSo far happy with this product"
1,I bought this tablet for my 6 year old for his birthday because he chose it when we went shopping for a tablet. He loves it and it is easy to use
1,This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.
1,My 2nd one. They work great.
1,"The voice recognition is much better than suri, but I have reservations about amazon collecting all conversations, not just those that begin with ""Alexa...""."
1,"First bought the Fire HD 8"" for myself and liked it so well that I got this one for my wife."
1,I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here
1,"My wife's old kindle died a couple months ago...I looked around for a replacement, and Best Buy offered the most competitive price...."
1,Love it easy to use just talk and your song or movie comes up
1,My kids love these tablets. They have a very easy operating system! Very user friendly!
1,Better than trying to listen to our favorite music on the radio! Speakers are great and will connect wireless speakers soon.Should have purchased this earlier. Will purchase another Echo Dot for another room. GREAT Concept!!
1,"I am enjoying my Kindle Fire 8 GB eReader Tablet. It has a good download speed when connected to wi-fi, and the touch screen is responsive. The only drawback is its inability to hold a charge for very long."
1,I needed this for my daughter and needed a tablet that cal handle all my daughters apps and have parental saggy This has it all
1,Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
1,Just as described.
1,It fine. I wasn't aware of what I was purchasing at the time but thought that I would need it in order to charge my book. Turns out I have several of them already from other electronics. Didn't really need it.
1,the console is small so you can basically place it anywhere. Very fast recommend to everyone
1,This was a Christmas gift to me. I love it! It stays in the kitchen and whenever anybody is busy in the kitchen it is nice to listen to whatever song you're thinking of. Hand free of course. Ask it anything you will get an answer. Very handy item to have.
1,"Got more than I expected. Got it as a device which replaced my cable box. Subscribed to PS Vue service, works very well. Cut my cable bill from 80 odd to 29. This little device is very snappy. Has much more apps than the Nexus player. With Netflix, Amazon prime movies , Kodi and NBC Sports : that pretty much covers 99% of the content which I would watch."
0,"I wanted to like this a lot because my Ipad Mini is ""heavy"" to carry in my purse all the time. This is so very light. BUT they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device AND when you buy it at Best Buy you are not given a choice to ""spend an extra 20 on a 119 dollar ""book"" or put up with their ads"". I had to go through being on hold FOREVER to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an IMMEDIATE turn-off. I don't find it to page-turn handle as well as my OLD ORIGINAL NOOK OR NOOK COLOR and certainly not anything like the Ipad Mini. If I hadnt kept it too long to return I would have. It doesn't auto correct to landscape then portrate, nope you have to MANUALLY CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER AND GOING BACK AND FORTH IS just stupid...it should have been part of the IMPROVED design, THEY REALLY MISSED THE MARK FOR THE PRICE. i CAN GET A FULL TABLET FOR LESS MONEY THAT DOES ALL THAT AND SIMPLY USE THE KINDLE APPPROSLight weightSmall for purseback lightCONS1-comes preloaded with ads2-not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store3-page control is not that simple4-t doesn't auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one OR the other5-not as touch responsive to anything6-don't like the organization of it"
1,Love this tablet I got it for my two toddler sons and they love it as well
1,I am big fan of Kindle fires. This particular one is very good as a basic tablet for e-books movies email and anything basic Internet wise . The resolution is low however movie still look good they sound good and all in all I'm quite pleased . The only issue someone may have is that it is not an android Amazon may not have the vast amount of apps that android do but this is something that can be overcome . So bottom line goody reader good movie and television application or apparatus and all in all good for the entire family
1,What a good gift for granddaughters. Price was great
1,Have bought 5 of these. Good wifi and has an Ethernet port much faster than fire stick
1,No more cable bills - I get all I need with it !!!
1,It was a gift for my wife and she said it is a 5 stars one.
1,This works very well for a reader but if you want to browse online it is not so good. The default Silk browser is slow; side loaded Opera and it is slow; Chrome is slow and Firefox is slow. So I have to assume that it is the Fire that is slow WiFi / browsing. But then it was an inexpensive piece of hardware.
1,I enjoy this tablet and will buy another one for my daughter to use.
1,Awesome little tablet for the price. My niece loves it and let's her watch her netflix instead of taking over my tv.
1,I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.
1,This Tablet was purchased as a gift for a friends mother who's not that handy with computers so this was perfect for her she loves it.
1,Using this to add to the media capabilities of my TV. Works great..
1,Better then the older models bigger and better then before
1,So far this kindle works great. Have used it in the dark and on the beach and have no visibility problems! Very satisfied.
1,"This device most definitely lives up to the hype, and I'm excited to see it full realize it's potential in the near future!!"
1,Wife never leaves it at home loves it great display easy on your eyes
1,Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter...(who is 4.5 years old) for Christmas so that she can watch learning videos and etc on. This is a nice little tablet. I only wish we had things like this in the dark ages when I was a child!
1,Cut the cable. save money. we love it and recommend
1,"Amazon Fire TV is the best streaming device money can buy and will cancel cox, directv and any other programming paying for. It works smoothly with good internet service and cable modem. Best device on market to stream movies and tv shows. Will keep buying them for my family."
1,The Echo offers many selection in music and local weather status. This device also provides current news reports and connects to my Amazon Audible account so it will continue reading a book to me that I had already started.
1,"Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage"
1,"Great for reading, watching movies, using on the go"
1,Bought for Christmas and my daughter loves it. $50.00 for a tablet is a great deal.
1,Tablet is very simple and easy to use daughter loves it
1,"I bought this for my wife. She loves it. It works very well, no problems. She plays a lot of games on it."
1,"The Echo simply performs as advertised. The function that prompted the purchase was integration with the Harmony remote I use for my home theater system. Once installed, I discovered some of the other things the Echo can do. As an example, it has the ability to control my Phillips Hue lighting system components that help set the mood in the theater. It isn't perfect but the list of capabilities continues to grow. You will like it."
1,"Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with. Now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you Apple Ipad and Samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you."
1,My old kindle was on its last legs and I needed a multi finctional tablet that was also a reader. The Kindle fire fit the bill excellentlty.
1,"Easy set-up, We figure that we can cut our cable bill almost $80 - $100 a month by using this. Also getting more channels we will watch, instead of paying for the cable companies choices that we don't care for."
1,"We have both the Apple TV and now Fire Stick and I'd have to say that we use the fire stick more. It's user interface is pretty decent once you're use to it and the available apps are great. We honestly have no complaints about it. Also, you can do ""a lot more"" on these than the other smart devices that don't allow you to use third party apps. Nice to be able to customize your device the way you want, if you ask me.Easy setup and I actually really like the voice activated remote."
1,"I bought two fire tabs for my kids on thanks giving... the were excited about it and liked it a lot... lots of games, movies and pretty good stuff for them."
1,I bought this for my son and one for my son-in-law. They are mesmerized by all that the Echo is capable of doing. (I want one!)
1,I really like the smaller size and backlight compared to my last kindle touch!
1,Enjoying this kindle. I like the lightness of it. Great buy.
1,"We had given hand-me down iPhones to the kids to use for car trips and the like a while back and were looking to update them. For the price, this is the best deal. You have access to a lot of the same apps (although you might have to start them over). It has a durable case. And is a good size for little hands. It is very helpful to be able to time activities so they don't have a choice about handing it back over. Only downside is one of our cords doesn't charge as well as we'd like and sometimes it seems a little slow starting certain apps in comparison to our apple products. But if you don't want to pay the apple price, this is the way to go. Kids will definitely be entertained by it!"
1,"Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books."
1,Product works as expected. Easy to set up and easy to use. Love it
1,"Very user friendly. Easy set up, and works great with my amazon prime account."
1,The tablet is great for the money. My boys still prefer the iPad but they still have fun on this tablet. Charge holds decent and selection of games is sufficient. Overall 4 out of 5 is solid given the value of this device.
1,I bought this tablet for my son (10 years old) and he loves it perfect price and size for him... With Amazon's underground app store he has almost unlimited amounts of free games he can download and also movies with the external storage is perfect.
1,I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
1,I own it for some time and i don't have complains.
1,Really enjoy it. there were come questions that Alexia could not answer. I use it for music a good bit
1,"Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8"" tablet HD"
1,I am having so much fun with my Amazon Echo. I discover no features every day. I especially love the music and news
1,We purchased this as a gift and the feedback we have received has been great.
1,I bought two of these tablets for my twin boys bday! They just turned 8 years old on Aug 22. They really like them. Also the graphics are awesome. I really would like to get the purple for myself.
0,Pretty slow if you're trying to use it as a full-time tablet. Good as an eReader and sometimes game and Internet usage.
1,Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.
1,I have owned a kindle before & prefer it to an ipad
1,The Kindle Fire is an excellent tablet for the price. Each member of my family has one and they meet all our needs and hold up very well.
1,I have had a couple of firesticks and they just don't work as good as the fire tv's. I now have 2 fire tv's. One is hard wired and one runs on wifi. I don't have any issues with them at all.
1,"I think this Echo is the most ""awesome"" and high tech product and a lot of fun. I impress my friends and family. They think it's great also."
1,Hard to figure out looks like a nice piece of furniture right now but it's really hard to determine how to use it
1,Amazon Echo is fun and is easily connected. Ask Alexa anything. This also plays games and gives you a weather report. Many talents. Just enable the different apps.
1,Good price. Battery life is good for a color tablet but you have to learn to charge more often after being used to a white pages tablet that does not use the same power.
0,"I've bought over 10 replacement charging wires, the ones with the micro mail end that inserts into the Fire to charge it. After one or two uses, the wires become loose and fall out. They definitely won't stay put to charge. Does anyone else have this problem? What's the solution? If not for this, I would recommend it."
1,Amazon has this one perfect. The backlight makes it easy to read.
1,"It meet my expectations. It performs well compared to other tables. I am very satisfied with the product and it quality. Lastly, it worth the price I paid for."
1,Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
1,She loves the size and how easy it is to learn. I only wish they had more options for cases.
1,"We have a lot of fun with this product. Doesn't always have the answers, but we just have to phrase the question appropriately."
1,Great purchase for my son's 6th birthday. He love it and the kid account is a great addition
1,I purchased this tablet for a 6 yr old and it is very easy for him to use.
1,Works well...is a lot of value for the money. Very happy!
1,This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
1,It is very easy to use and allows you to read at the beach with no problems. No glare. Great value for your money
1,"Worked right out of the box, and connected to internet very quickly. I must say that I have fallen in love with Alexa; she does many things for me:Sets timersSets alarms, and manages my calender Does routine math And many other things that I have not even discovered yet."
1,I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
1,We use this everyday of the week. All the options it has makes it perfect for everyone. Setup was easy as is using it. Everyone should have one.
1,Bought tha laptop for my wife to use she really enjoys it
0,The eco is great if your a lists person or want to order Pizza. Yes it can control lights and locks but it doesn't support my remote lights I have now. The Eco just can't answer technical home work questions like the Google can
0,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.
1,Better than I anticipated! Has great sound when playing music.
1,"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
1,This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
1,"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?"
1,Great for my kids and is easy to block purchases. Even better if you have amazon prime.
0,I would not purchase this item again as there is no 4K content.
1,"Great tablet for anyone. works perfect. of course I would rather have a 10"" but for the price this works great"
1,I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
1,"This product has a better processor with 2gb of ram, plus the ports RJ 45, SD Card, and USB, the difference is big for the difference of the price. It's logically faster than the firestick"
1,It's great. I can control my 2 a/c thermostats and tv with it. Looking for more things i can control with.
1,"I wanted to buy it long time ago, the price I bought in best buy is good for me. Of course, the quality is good."
0,"Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment."
1,Great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway.
1,I bought this for myself as an early Christmas present and I'm in love. The sound quality is awesome and Alexa tells the funniest yet shortest stories in history.
0,Would not recommend to anybody I had to take it back three times and still would not hook up to TVs very poor customer service
1,My son loves this tablet. He can read books and play games on one device.
1,"I love the idea of Alexa and the next step to home automation. Alexa is fun and helpful at the same time. Updates on the weather and news as well as some facts, how to spell, etc. Sometimes it does not have an answer like ""when did NASA land on the moon""? I can control my thermostat, play all sorts of music, radio stations, control it all from my phone and more. There is a third party software company IFTTT that has appellate to allow you to accomplish much more with Alexa."
1,"Love it. I can easily listen to music get answers to questions and shop all while I am cooking, cleaning..."
1,"This was given as a gift. The recipient is thoroughly happy. It is something he has wanted for awhile, mostly because his siblings have one too."
1,"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!"
1,"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
1,"I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now. (Looked at Kobo also). So far, I like it. Great screen, backlight on mine doesn't have the problems that others have complained about."
1,sweet product beats older ones by a mile! I checked out others but this was the best all around e reader hands down. I read at all times very easy to read at night time with little light. Easy too get what ever you want to read .
1,I bought this tablet for my grandson in 4th grade. He loves it.
0,"Very little storage, Amazon Android skin bloated and too many ads"
1,"Works great, a gift for my daughter for Christmas."
1,My mother can not. See every well and lives alone. This has been great for her. Makes her feel a little less alone.
1,My kid love it I buy 2 for my 2 kid battery life Is all way last longer
1,"I bought my son a Kindle a couple of years ago and decided to update his kindle to the newer vesion. He uses it for everything, which is great. Love that he can do so much with the kindle."
0,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
1,I would recommend this product to all my friends and family!
1,"The Amazon Echo is used by me every day for various tasks. It can get me my daily news briefings, tell me the weather outside and play music form my Amazon library and other sources. Very useful and fun item."
1,My kids love the tablet and the battery life is amazing.
1,"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet."
1,This is great for kids and adult. A great product for gaming reading and more..
1,"Main purpose, take home automation to next level, voice control. Purchase of Echo was to ingrate LIFX and Samsung Smart Hub by using voice. While this is not flawless, it works pretty good! It is on the bleeding edge so some challenges are to be expected. The apps for Echo appear to be growing, I just hope development continues. Next on list would be the harmony controller so that I can start to ingrate TV and Audio controls using Echo! At this time Sonos appears to be a challenge and a personal server appears to be the only option. Would recommend purchase! Help to keep the community growing! Make recommendations and comments on the apps you use!"
1,I was looking for something small that was easy to take with us on the go for my daughter to use and play with. It is very easy to use.
1,Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.
1,"Easy to read, with a variety of content, long battery duration."
1,great product She is very smart. easy to use and display.
1,Better performance and clarity than the Amazon fire stick.
1,Tablet is good for the price. A good tablet for beginner and does what we need it for.
1,"Alexa can be very useful. Alexa is like your personal assistant. She can tell you reminders, put things on your calendar for you, play games, tell you the weather in the news, give you advice on which recipes would be to your liking, and tell you jokes. She has thousands of skills which are like apps on my phone. You have to enable them and then she will complete what you want her to do."
1,I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
1,Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids
0,"I ordered the echo based upon online reviews and based on suggestions of friends. However, thus far, the only thing I ever use it for is to play music, which I could easily do with my other electronics. I am holding out hope that future updates make this more of a must have item."
1,Voice feature is really convenient. Fast with little to no buffering. But I don't like that you have to pay for episodes on channels you already pay from Subscribed channels like AMC. Roku doesn't do that.
1,The tablet is just the right size. The games are fun and has so many other uses
1,"This new paperwhite was purchased to replace an older 2nd Gen Kindle. This one is bright, easy to read and small."
1,I love my Kendle Fire. Fits in my purse perfectly. Always have books on hand.
1,I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.
1,Alexa helps me so much and it's not only in the kitchen she keep me entertained making my SmartThings all work together
1,Quality was good and the bluetooth worked ok but diconnected at times maybe because it was not charged?
1,"I am someone who swears by Apple products so I am skeptical when it comes to other names. I decided to get my son a extra tablet to use for kindle apps. I CAN SAY I LOVE THIS TABLET !! Great apps that are totally free, awesome battery life and sound is spectacular !! Buy this tablet you can't go wrong !! Going to purchase another one."
1,"I have been a kindle owner since they first came out. This version has many,many more bells and whistles but I still use mine mostly for books, audible books and a place for me to download music I can listen to when I travel. Sometimes it is a bit slow opening up different apps and functions but overall it is functional, dependable and useful to me"
1,Way to set up. Easy to use. Add on apps are easy to install as well
1,The echo does very well with playing radio station and some music . There are many artists she doesn't recognize . A number of artists you have to pay extra for through a signup . I was somewhat disappointed that with more than 2 million items more regular music should be available. Amazon prime under performs here . Setting alarms and timers are easy . I look forward to interfacing with lights and thermostats
1,This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
1,Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
1,"Easily to set up, very entertaining worth it the money. Thanks"
1,"This Kindle Voyage is replacing an older Kindle from 4-5 years ago and what an awesome upgrade it is. Faster, has a very useful backlight, still very easy to use, and so light!!"
1,I had hardly any computer experience and I love my tablet and would recommend one for everyone.
1,Hands free ask her anything and she'll answer and the speaker is loud
1,So glad I got this! Awesome addition to our house!
1,This is my second Fire TV and the setup is as easy as the first. Very simple to use and the benefits pay for itself. Worth it.
1,"Great functionality, user friendly and nice apps.."
0,It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.
1,This is my second kindle ...second paper white bought for my niece. Love the ease of reading without the distractions you get on tablets
1,"I was looking for something easier to read emails with than my phone, but small and light for travel. This is just the right size. I have an 11 inch tablet but it is too large and heavy."
1,"I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5."
1,"I bought this for my wife, Alexa is great. answers all our commands."
1,"Great, non-expensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my Ipad."
1,Like the small size and convenience. Recharges quickly and is available when my Lenovo tab needs to be charged.
1,My son loves the tablet. Ha ugh the freedom to down load any app he wants. He uses it everyday. Only downside is the battery life.
0,"The Echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy. Alexa (echo) learns as you talk to it and ask questions. You have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow Alexa to answer more questions. As for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense. You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me. On occasion, Alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond."
1,"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor"
1,I haven't learned all of the tricks and tips. It it sure is nifty so far!
1,This tablet is a great buy at it's price point and is the perfect entry level tablet. The Kindle app is flawless and reading on the Fire is a pleasure!
1,"I really like it, it's working out quite well for me wish I had bought one a lot sooner"
1,I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
1,"I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one"
1,"I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader."
1,"I recently bought an Amazon Fire Tv, because we're planning on getting rid of our cable service. However, when I got it home I realized my current Tv's are too old to use it. I can't say how it's working yet simply because now I have to upgrade my tv's."
1,"I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing."
1,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but the reviews were right. The Echo is great piece of technology! I need to add more smart devices to fully appreciate the capabilities,but great for facts, music, news and weather.My kids love it and my wife too!"
1,Great tablet for a beginner Tablet being used by older
1,We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
1,The echo is an awesome addition to our home we listen to music often and love that it can control our satellite
1,"I bought this as a gift for my grandmother. I debated between the Basic Kindle or the Paperwhite and chose the Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it! It's very basic and easy for her to navigate. Everything is straight forward. The Kindle Paperwhite is nice because of it being backlite she can read in the dark or ever outside in the direct sunlight. There is no glare whatsoever. The size perfect for her hands and do not get sore or achy as if she was reading a paperback book. If your looking for a device strictly for reading purposes only get the Kindle Paperwhite. Overall, I and my grandmother are greatly impressed with this product. I had my doubts at first due to never using a product like this, but im considering getting myself one."
1,"Bought for a friend and he loves it. Using it to record notes for school, surfing the net and listening to music."
1,Purchased it for the kids and they love it. Easy to use
0,My 3yr old grandson loves it. Will only be used for him
1,I thank it sAid liStin to us a little batter
1,Great value for what I needed. Just using it to receive email ordersfrom Grub Hub for my restaurant
1,Bought it for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it.
1,The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. Worth the low cost I paid for it.
1,"What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made."
1,"This thing is awesome! I am not much of reader myself but wanted to get into reading to improve my reading speeds and enjoy a good book every now and then. This seemed to worked perfectly for me. I can say I know enjoy reading very much, even after years and years of never picking up a book.I have always wanted a kindle ever since I saw the wonderful paper-like screen it had, and this one in particular has a built in adjustable light, which is a great feature for reading in dark places.With kindle unlimited it makes it even easier and really inexpensive to read books without the commitment to have to buy the book, not to mention all the free samples.I have yet to even scratch the surface on the newspapers, magazines and other fairly inexpensive subscription based services offered by kindle store. Can't wait!"
1,I had a kindle fire that was about 4 years old and wore it out. This was purchased to replace that one and I love it. It is a little lighter and smaller. Still has all the great features and you cannot beat the price for this small tablet. I highly recommend it!
1,I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing this device over a Roku. I am so glad that I did. Even though I have cable tv I end up watching this device for movies and other entertainment more then cable tv. Everything loads super fast.
1,"easy to use, practical, bigger than a phone smaller than an ipadeasy on the eyes. the only draw back is the touch screen needs to be easier. one must tap harder to open the apps. otherwise very satisfied with this item"
1,"I had the Fire Stick prior to purchasing the Fire TV and it is night and day. Fire TV is much faster and has larger buffer, there is no lag in response time while watching TV thru Fire TV. Very happy with this purchase."
1,Enjoy my tablet. Easy to carry in purse. It was a great buy. Love reading from it.
1,Like being able to read outside and easier to take with me when traveling than a book is.
0,"I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend."
1,Great idea to not have to use a book light/light source
1,"Bought this for a door prize, very nice features person who won it was very happy"
1,I bought this thinking it was needed for the Echo that I purchased. It was not. However if I ever want an Amazon Fire TV it will be ready.
1,This is my first experience to use Amazon Tablet.This very useful in your life.You can use Android Market and Amazon Market too.I recommend this one. Cheap and convenient.
1,"Wow. I've had many tablets, but none come close to this for the price. The screen is clear and responsive. While it comes locked to amazon, i sideloaded the nook app without root, and then rooted it easily, just for fun. XDA has the details."
1,Bought it for my nephew and he loved it. Great purchase
1,Gave this as a gift to my future son-in law and he loved it and using it on a regular basis. Easy to use and a lot of fun!
1,Satisfied with the quality but unlike iPad you have to purchase virus protection
1,"I love, love, love my Amazon Echo it is the perfect companion for my smart home."
1,Works exactly how I expected. No complaints. Really like the white too.
1,My brother told me about this product. I bought it for my son and he loves it.
1,I love the the Kindles!! Bought this for my grandson. Impressed with the 2 years no questions asked warranty.
1,I love everything about it I really enjoy it I use it alot
1,Nice little tablet does what o want it to do will definitely buy again
1,We purchased this for our 10 yr old son with Aspergers. He was immediately able to understand and navigate the Amazon Fire. Thank you.
1,This is my first tablet and I really like it. Easy to use and I like the touch screen a lot better then the tablet my kid got at another store. Perfect size for my hand.
1,Bought to use with PlayStation view as my tv provider. It works great so far.
1,Kindle with a built in light makes it so easier! Comes with a first year warranty with Kindle's purchase.
1,Didn't want to spend $200 on the Echo for someone who's not use to using a Bluetooth speaker. Great buy and functions well.
1,Echo is a great addition to the home especially since we have WeMo products in the house and able to control lights throughout the house by simply telling Alexa. Great sound in the kitchen to listen to music with Amazon's Prime music library.
1,Love the paperwhite. Option of backlighting is great when reading in the dark but still able to see when outside in the sun. I do wish it had adaptive backlighting (I prefer to have backpighting off to save battery during daylight reading). Overall a great reading device.
1,"Absolutely love my Echo. In fact, this is our second one...for our second home. Whether you need/want the weather, music, news updates or just have a random question, Echo is the answer. Already have bought two additional Echo's for Christmas gifts."
1,"This was purchased for my older grandson, age 6, for Christmas and as I stated in another review it has had games downloaded on it and will be ready to use when it is opened by him."
1,I think it's a great tablet and it's great for the price
1,"With a great child-proof case, this was the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with!"
1,"I love my Kindle paperwhite. The backlit screen is great for reading at night, it has a long battery life and I love being able to use it in full sunlight."
1,"The Amazon Echo is everything that's advertised: smart, intuitive, and has a plethora of information and features at her metaphorical fingertips. I definitely recommend this for anyone as it makes life a whole lot easier."
1,was skeptical about the small size but a few minutes of checking it out showed me that this is a great little tablet. gave as a gift and she loves it. portable and great display.
1,Great for small children allows for limited time setting. Also allows parents to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time. Case works well
1,It was an excellent purchase from best buy. I would recommend buying this if you Netflix.
0,"Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet."
1,"For the cost of the tablet, I am very pleased. It is much easier to use this for Kindle vs. reading off of my phone!"
1,A fantastic tablet for the price. It's not HD but the display is very sharp and vibrant. A great tablet for kids and teens.
1,Heck fifty bucks for a tablet a name brand tablet that feels premium not bad for the money!
1,Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
1,Perfect tablet for my 4 year old since he was always taking mine. Love having color options to make it feel more like his.
1,"There is nothing else left on the eink market anyway but the Amazon Kindle. It still doesn't support epub format of course, Amazon doesn't like competition. It is built OK, moderately cheap plastic, but no squeaking at least. Contrast is OK, I had Nook and it is on par. I can't imagine how bad the regular Kindle would be though. This one with 300 dpi is just OK. Scrolling is fast enough, it has integrated vocabulary. No home menu or other physical buttons though, besides the home Kindle one - the UI is not completely responsive when you try to go to your Library, instead home brings you to Amazon Kindle page, where you are overwhelmed with advertisement.My biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface. It is WAY worse then Nook, which is much more reading-centric.A lot of cheap and free books are available on Amazon, especially with Prime membership. It can be linked to public library for ebooks as well."
1,It was easy to set up. It is even easier to use. And I love all the free movies !!!!
1,A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
0,"You get what you pay for, or so they say. We purchased 3 and 1 of the tablets has started to fail. Mind you my daughter has used it for a week. We have had to reboot it 2 times now. Of course we googled the issue and were able to fix the problem ourselves. It goes completely black. Other 2 tablets are perfectly fine so far."
1,"I had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the Paperwhite because I read at night. It was a great decision, because when I turn the light all the way down, I can't read at night. It's lightweight and sturdy. My only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn. It's not a show stopper, because it is so much better than trying to read on my iPad mini."
1,"Thanks to Amazon Echo, I don't have to go through the burden of always going on my phone or computer to get little things done. From setting an alarm to playing your favorite song, Amazon Echo is one of the most promising products and best experience I've ever invested in."
1,"For the price and size, ease of use you cannot go wrong, and if you dont try to use it for more than it is meant to be-reader,surfing ,watching content and shopping- great low cost choice"
1,"This was gift, and it was totally unexpected. It is amazing. I cant wait connect it to other equipment. The TV, The Thermostat. It's like being Captain Kirk."
1,i have this and 2 fire sticks and a alexa. combine that with amazon prime and you have all you need
1,"Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."
1,"The tablet works nice for reading and surfing the internet. It also has decent choice of games to download from Amazon. It also plays video decent, but the resolution on the screen on the screen is a little lacking, It is not an iPad Air, but as a basic tablet it functions well for the price."
1,It's awesome being able to have 4K capability and being able to play games but it does get laggy at times.
1,Working good and easy operation. Better than stick
1,This is a great tablet for anyone to use. This is a wonderful product to purchase.
1,great price on a tablet. Plus have always had great success with kindle.
1,"My wife and I actually bought two of these for our two younger children. I love that they give us control over how much screen time they get, when they're available to be turned on, and when they turn off. As well as when they can play the games after their reading time. Just awesome."
1,"We love our Echo. It has been a fun toy for all in the family. She updates us on weather, plays music, tells us the news and even tells us jokes!"
1,Great alternative to Ipad mini and the out of pocket cost is much less.
1,"If you love the idea of having all your books in the same place, at all times. you should get an Amazon Fire. I purchased this tablet for my Fianc because he reads tons of books. Now he doesn't have to remember where his books are, because he can now have them at all times on one device!"
1,"Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit"
1,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, it's easy to use and light weight. I'm still using a first gen Kindle Fire and after playing with his I wish I bought one for myself too! It has many features an Android phone would have."
1,"Good product overall. I used it mainly to control smart switches (WEMO), ecobee, in addition to all the other ""smart things"" you can do. Having an IFTTT account is definitely helpful and compatible with certain products. Not compatible with Chamberlin MyQ Garage wifi opener."
1,I bought 4 of these tablets for Christmas presents. 2 of them were for my 4 and 6 year old grandkids. I love how they have parental controls and how easy they are for the kids to use. We are still browsing the app store to find them games but all the ones they used to use my phone for were found right away.
1,"This is great for a reader. I was hoping to get a Kindle Paperwhite that had internet access through a browser. From I can tell that option is not available. But, we definately wanted the PaperWhite."
1,I bought this for my 3 year old twins and they love it. It is very easy for them to use with kids free time.
1,Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.
1,"From the time when the kindles came out I was not so sure on how well they would work, well this one is a good companion for students and to keep you entertained."
1,Very good reading on this good and strong quality kindle
1,"Echo came in on time and packaged well. Size is good. Playing music is good. Doesn't always understand what is asked and some things doesn't know or have to find just right way to ask. However, I'm still learning about it and it is still learning. Responds very quickly when it understands what is asked. It is fun so far and I hope will get even better."
1,I can not believe how nice this Fire is for the $33 I paid for it. I would Not spend a lot of money on a expensive tablet when this one will do most everything the big dollar ones will do!
1,"I just wish it had an optical audio out like the previous model so that's why it loses a star but in general, it's a cool device to stream movies etc."
1,Great for young ages and can be stored easily in school backpack
1,This works great and provides me tons of options with apps.
1,I like the flexibility and great responsiveness of the FireTV. Our family is able take advantage of the built in options (including Amazon Prime) and set it up just the way I like. I also have friends who prefer the Fire Stick. They have customized those and still have good performance. FireTV is great for anyone and even better if you are a little tech savvy..
0,"The one thing i had an issue with,is I would leave my amazon speaker on playing since it's always listening. But,at times it would just cut off by itself,without my command. Another issue would be if I'm on the phone and what I'm saying may sound close to the command according to the speaker itself, it would automatically light up for me to command it to do something. Don't know if i like the idea of it listening all the time."
1,"Alexa is awesome, works for what I want, next lights. She actually listens to me.At first I had my reservations but it surpassed my expectations. Really wish I had more time to learn new things to do with it."
1,This was a gift for a family I adopted. It was a great gift and they loved it!
1,All the best that the last Fire Tv was but now it's 4K ready and you have Alexa to help guide and open apps. My mom loved her gift.
0,the amazon fire sucks the pictures and camera sucks and blurry as can be
1,"I read the camera specs which is what caught my eye and they are great - takes great picture but the ""zoom"" feature quickly distorts actual picture."
1,good product for less price.Best deal from bestbuy
1,Bought these for my kids and they love it. Love amazon.
1,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.
1,Exceeded my expectations. Light & text adjustable. Able to buy books from device and to review from Goodreads. Downloads instantly. Lightweight and easy to hold. Fits in my purse perfectly for reading on the go!
1,Amazing product. Easy to use and set up. Bought one for all my family members after I purchased mine
1,"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
1,I really like the kindle fire and would recommed it to anyone that is looking for tablet
1,Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay
1,"Better than his last Kindle, camera is great addition"
1,I got this as a Deal of the Day for use as an utility tablet. It has good performance and a great display. It's very good as a reader.
1,"The Amazon Echo has been extremely helpful with putting together ad hoc grocery lists or lists for ""to do's"" around the house. Admittedly, I am in the process of learning all the bells and whistles, but it has already been super helpful! Great product, would recommend for anyone."
0,For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak
1,Fire TV changed my life! This unit is awesome. I absolutely love it.
1,Great value. Easy to set up. Light weight nd very portable. Will provide hours of entertainment for my child.
1,Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
1,I bought this for my 5 year old to watch movies on. It does the job but it takes a while just to get Google Play. They tried to block this feature but you can go youtube on how to add it. Other than that I would never buy this for myself but good enough for a kid for movies.
1,Great product I bought it for my mom for mothers day
1,I had one of the older kindles but decided to buy this one because you can read in the dark. What a great decision!!! Recommend to anyone that enjoys reading.
0,works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.
0,Better quality then most tablets in same price range. I still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. Ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.
1,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me, since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase."
1,Good tech product but needs more basic information. Constantly states that not able to answer my questions at this time. Might need more information on how to program for more content information.
1,The parental control could be a lot better. It's nice and compact. She loves it
1,"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
1,"Amazing what these little things can do, I Willy continue to buy them again and again."
1,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge."
1,I really like the Echo device. Still learning how to get the most out of this technology. Wish you could make and receive calls from this device.
1,excellent product ! this is my second firetv box!!!
1,This tablet is very practical and easy to use for small kids and teens.
1,This charger is produced by Amazon and backed by its excellent quality control and manufacturing process.
1,"Wasn't sure if this product was too gimmicky or not but we've placed it in the kitchen and use it all the time. Still learning about all the things it can do but we get the news, weather, listen to our favorite music while cooking and ask it some dumb questions just for fun. It really does find almost every song you request and I just started a shopping list. Worth the cost!"
1,"excellent product for an ereader, very user friendly"
1,100 SATISFIED!
1,Iam just in love with my Amazon echo!! Cam straight home and set it up acting with a WeMo device I ourvsed to test out on a lamp. I definitely recommend an amazon house. It makes everyday question so much simpliar!!
1,"The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank."
1,"I bought this Tablet because it had high reviews, and was at a great price for a first Tablet."
1,Everything work well i like it alot good enough for me
1,One of the best tech items I have purchased in the last ten years!
1,"Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing."
1,This product was very easy not only for my 7 and 8 year old nephews but it was rather easy for my 3 and 4 year old nephews to navigate as well. Still works from last year and thats why we purchased one this year for my niece.
1,My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
1,we got our 14 year old an Amazon Fire for Christmas. The screen was broken a couple months ago. She liked it so well that she used her own money and bought a new one.
1,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
1,I have a couple of these along with a couple of firesticks. Works good with the Kodi App
1,"Easy to use, easy to handle, and good for her to learn responsibility for her own device!"
1,I bought one and recommended this product also to my family and friends!
1,"I bought this Kindle as a gift for my 9 year old grand daughter. I have one of my own and absolutely love it. I read books, surf the web and also read all my personal emails with it. Great product for a great price! And so easy to use."
1,"Well I don't have anything bad to say about the Echo! Alexa is always there to answer a question, tell me a joke, give the weather report or play my favorite music!! She sets a timer for me while I am middle of preparing dinner or baking, I love how it hears your voice over music or background noice and is ready for your commands!!"
1,This is a great entry level tablet. It has full functionality and is well built. The only thing I don't like is the slow processing speed but it is more than worth the money
1,This was for a 3 year old and is easy enough for her to use good price too
1,This is a good product for reading and browsing Internet.
1,"I am an Amazon Prime member so the Amazon Fire Tv seems to be a no brainer. I took advantage of the Sling Tv offer where you prepay for 3 months you get $50 off of the streaming device. So, basically for $10 more you get 3 months of 20 channels, that's a good deal. Take advantage of it."
1,Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
1,"Alexa is a fun toy, I think it has lots of undiscovered capabilities, that I discover every day.. It is question based. I sure wish I could have a conversation with Alexa, however maybe on the next update"
1,fast loading no buffering on the best price on market for streaming.
1,This item was so great for our TV streaming needs we went back and bought another one for the other TV. Only down side is the remote is so small it is easy to lose. *beep* Alexa tell us a joke.
1,Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.
1,i got the amazon fire tab on black friday. i was very satisfied with how it function and operate speed and quilty for the price they gave it for one day. i had two laptop stolen and can't afford t buy new one . so i got this tab. to keep in touch photos for eBay and other. the only thing that i did not like was that i could not download google apps only amazon..
1,I bought this as a gift for my dad and he absolutely loves it! He can't stop ranting about it!
1,I needed a stream player to cut cable . So I went with the amazon tv. Has it all internal storage and capability to add a SD card. Works great with kodi
1,I love the amazon speaker!!! It has a voice activated speaker named Alexa and she is full of incredible tasks. I connected her to my lights and I can have her control them from anywhere in the house!!!
1,Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
1,"From news, to music, to the weather and much more. The amazon echo makes mornings and showers a lot more fun! The voice recognition is best I've ever seen. Alexa can hear me from my bedroom while its stationed in the living room."
1,Bought for grandkids learning to read. Have found lots of kids books. They love them
1,I love the ability to connect to the Internet via Ethernet cable. I had fewer buffering issues. The upscaling quad core processor also made for a clearer picture.
1,Was happy to use this to take my commutes entertainment to the next level
1,"...really wanted to go all in when these first came out, but very glad I bided my time. Excellent product and outstanding edition to our home automation. Plus highly entertaining for music, news, weather, you-name-it. Highly recommend!"
1,Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
1,We purchased this for our 3 year grandson for Christmas and he just fell in love with it. Great learning tool to start kids off with!
1,"If you want the combination of a kindle for reading as well as some of the features of a tablet, this is an excellent value for the price. I like the flexibility of being able to switch between the book I am reading and my email or other web uses.It seems like the battery discharges rather quickly compared to my other kindle. I often keep this one plugged in while I am using it."
1,"The tablet was reasonably priced it worked well, but I don't like how you have to register with Amazon.."
1,Really feeling futuristic the Echo is amazing. I love the hands free literally talking to an electronic device that can assist you in numerous daily task. I use it often and it would appear to be learning the more I use it. I'm going to start getting all the devices that will turn my home into a smart home. LOVE IT!!!
1,Great tablet Santa brought this for my son and it has zero problems unlike the Samsung Santa brought last year which was nothing but trouble and then the mother board took a s**t! You could buy about six of the fires for how much the samsung tab was!
1,"This is my 2nd Amazon Fire and I prefer my previous one only because I don't care for all the advertisements that pop up while I'm trying to do things on this one. Otherwise, it has good speed, clear screen, and is easy to navigate."
1,This amazon fire tv box is one of the best media devices available.
1,My granddaughter loves this and it came as promised.
0,Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
1,I can see many more uses for this. I like the way it can be improved easily with more functionality added.
1,Great product to own works well with everything. Very helpful for the family
1,Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.
1,I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.
1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Great value for the price. Beautiful picture and it has all the the features she needs for class and social networking.
1,"I love all the things Alexa can do. It is very useful. I put events on my calendar, listen to music, have Alexa wake me up, she can tell corny jokes and answer many questions and do so much more."
1,Received my new kindle in perfect condition and I am very happy it is faster and a clearer it has a. bigger had drive at a good price and a fast delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongThank you
1,Kindle is a very portable reader to replace paperbook.
1,I purchased this because I previously has the kindle paperwhite but it had died. being kind of limited on funds but needed a kindle due to all the books I read I opted for the fire. I love it. I'm able to see the covers which entice me to purchase books so I remember books easier than before. I also can do more things on the fire and the price is $100 less than the paper white kindle...
1,"This is my second Kindle Reader. Purchased the first one in 2011, but it was stolen this past Spring. So I purchase this Kindle Paperwhite. It is great No glare outside and it is easy to adjust the print size."
1,"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."
1,"This is my new favorite device. While not perfect, it's a lot of un to use.One of the features I like the best is the timer functions. I can start a timer for various items, while cooking, and Alexa will remind me when the timer hits zero. The best part is that, through IFTT, I can trigger Alexa to call my phone, or send a notification, if I'm not in the same room as she is. I do the same for when I'm doing laundry. I no longer have to go back and check how much time is left on the washer and dryer. I can even have my Hue lights to blink when the timer has expired.Right now, I have Lutron, iDevices, and Hue Homekit devices in my house. Through the Skills for each of these companies, the Echo found all the devices, and I'm not able to control all of them using my voice. Really great device to own and play around with."
1,This is amazing for the price. I purchased this for a teenager and he loves it.
0,Great value for the price. Not as user friendly as the original Kindle Fire but still a good starter tablet for those that are less tech savvy.
1,Easy to use and works great. Able to watch all the things I love.
1,I love the Kindle Paperwhite as I can read it indoors and outdoors with no glare issues. I'm able to download books as needed very quickly. Keeps me updated in my reading library.
1,what i read about it looked like a great gift for my grnaddaughter
1,"This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it."
1,Nice little tablet. Works well for watching movies and listening to music. Internet use and playing some games can create slow response times.
1,I have owned the echo for about a month now and it has worked great. Connects directly to the internet and also streams music from major streaming services and allows connections from Bluetooth. You can also download skills which gives it added functionality. It can do so many things that it is taking me time to explore the limits of its capabilities great product..
1,Gave this to my mom and dad and they love it! Perfect!
1,Product does exactly what you would think. Works well for any and all type reading.
0,It is an ok product. But the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner. It is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks. But like it says it is ok for the price.
1,"There are definitely better tablets out there but being able to read books, surf the internet and play games for $50 is a no brainer."
1,It is good for kids. Biggest drawback is the battery life. It doesn't seem to last as long. I wouldn't buy it for general day to day use or for anything more than playing games etc. Get the HD for those reasons.
1,"This fits perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is. The price was amazing, didn't find it anywhere else close the the price."
1,I liked the amazon stick so much I upgraded to an amazon fire. I'm very happy with the purchase.
1,"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
1,"Has a great speaker for playing music. Love all that Alexa can do, looking forward to add on""s in the future."
1,We use this all the time. It is great for information and music
0,"Alexa is a great tool. It's fun to use, but the DOT has just as much functionality and seems to hear my voice better. The speaker on the Echo is better, but when the volume us up high, it can't hear me at all. The DOT can connect to an external speaker via bluetooth or 3.5mm, and it's a third of the price"
1,Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.
1,I bought it for it's practicality but loved it for its versatility.
1,"I debated between Echo and the Dot, and went with the Echo, due to the sound quality. I can play music and can hear it all through the house.. the quality is great. Still learning new things.. fun to play with!"
1,It's not the biggest or fastest but for the price it is perfect! It's a great little device that works well.
0,"This tablet is great for a first time tablet owner, just smaller than my current one."
1,"Use it daily home and on the road, my husband is hooked on it as well"
1,I gave this item to my wife and she loves it. She has used it to answer many questions and listen to music.
1,"Purchased this as a gift for a Senior, very simple to use for her needs."
1,"Picture quality isn't the best compared to pricer tablets, this tablet is great for only $40. If you watch a lot of vids, I suggest getting the HD version as the picture/audio is better"
1,"I bought the Amazon's Fire Box and it is worth every dime. I love this box, I can watch all my movies and tv series on this box. It also has the voice search and it has 4K Ultra HD which shows a great pic. Best item you can buy. You will love it!."
1,"Our Echo is fun. The only problem is that Alexa seems to turn herself off and won't respond. Otherwise, love the music."
1,Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.
1,For $50 you are getting a quality device that is perfect for web browsing and media streaming.
1,Wife and kids love this product. I think it has become our personal weathergirl.
1,Love the size for reading and also for playing games online. Tablet is fast to respond.
1,"It works great. We are using it to play pandora music all day at the store. So far, we don't have any issue. It works very consistently."
0,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
1,The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.
1,"cause if you didnt know, now you know.. but u knew"
1,Good buy! This is the best streaming device out in the market today.. Its really worth every penny
1,I absolutely love my amazon echo. It is very convenient and handy.
1,"Very good tablet, great options and features for the price."
1,This is a good tablet. Kids are happy and so am I. Got my stuff back now that kids have their own.
0,"Tablet itself is good, I mostly use it to read on the go. However, this tablet only works with Amazon approved apps. As long as you don't mind it, this is a good choice. Get it on sale for a better price"
1,Bought Fire tablet on impulse and not sorry. Like much better than my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Felt 8 g was enough storage space since they've now added external storage space.
1,Good basic tablet.Good basic tablet.Good basic tablet.
1,This is a vast improvment over my older model. It is easy to change print size. The fact that you can use it in the dark is a good improvment.
1,Amazon Fire has a fast interface and offers all the services you would expect from a streaming box. The Playstation Vue app actually works better on my Fire than on my PS4.
1,I was searching on Amazon for the Kindle 7 but it was out of stock until AFTER Christmas. Went to Best Buy and found they had more than enough in stock. Got one for my daughter who loves it. Thanks!
0,The Kindle works as it should and was inexpensive but has a short battery life
1,This was just what we were looking for our kids picked it right up and was playing on it in just minutes
1,This product really helped my father in law hear and have conversations with his daughter who's voice is a higher pitch.
1,"I used the Echo for on demand music, news, weather, and general information. This is a simply one of the most piece of electronics I have ever bought.."
1,Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
1,"I own a Chromecast and didn't think I would need this. How wrong I was! The Amazon Fire TV box is more functional and useful than the Chromecast. It is easy to travel with and as long as you have a solid Internet connection (wired or wireless), you can enjoy this device. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend it! So nice I bought it twice!"
1,Easy to use and quick to set up. Even kids love to use it and pictures are good.
1,Present or grandma's birthday. She loves it. Would recommend
1,"I've had the first kindle fire, I love the tablet.Why because it's bigger"
1,I am very happy with my purchase I can read books on the go I don't like having to carry a lot of luggage so the compact myth of this product makes it personal for traveling on planes and trains
1,Help me cut the cable cord Easy set up Plenty of apps Good user interface
1,Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
1,Great product like just as much as the fire stick great
1,I give to my husband as a gift and he is very happy!
1,"It's more for fun, We use it for shopping lists and music mostly. Would love to get my whole house on for lighting."
1,"I have a Chromecast and Apple TV, but have not used them since I bought this device. An absolute must - especially if you have Amazon Prime!"
1,Great except it offers no mirroring or airplay support
1,This table does everything you NEED.. not necessarily everything you want. But It's great for the $$ you pay and it's really handy. I take it around with me all the time.
1,Incredible value for the price! And it's the perfect size. Try one out at Best Buy and you'll see what I mean!
1,My wife is an avid reader and loves the Kindle. She has tried other tablets but none are as good as the paperwhite Kindle. This is the one she carries in her purse to pull out read during waits for doctors.
1,"I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
1,Very good tablet to gift somebody. I bought for my niece.
1,We loved this purchase. would recommend to others.
1,"I've always been a fan of gadgets,and I had to have it.I had read some of the reviews that were quite favorable, but I had to find out for myself.I absolutely love it. The sound is rich and room filling. In fact, the sound in bigger than its very discreet size."
1,So having this Amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros & cons let's be clear you aren't getting an iPad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web & emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:
1,I love being able to read on the tablet and not have to use the battery on my telephone.
1,"A no frills budget tablet. Although it can do some light gaming, I would not recommend it for that, Its best at watching video, browsing the web and reading,"
1,"This is a wonderful way to cut the cable cord! We have Amazon Prime, so our Viewing membership is paid, and there are so many TV show series/movies to watch, especially with Kodi loaded on the unit. We rounded it out with an inexpensive Sling membership, which gives us the live TV we need for current news and network shows. We are saving so much on our cable bill and couldn't be happier with our viewing experience!"
1,"Very expensive charger. I think the kindle should come with it as does all other tablets, including the fire, which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just 50. It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all."
1,Great size fast . For the price you can't go wrong
1,Price is affordable but Display pix is very less compared other products in the market for the same price.
1,This is an awesome purchase. You can watch a lot of shows
1,"my husband loves this. we coupled it with the playstation vue streaming service for $30/mo and dropped cox cable totally. we found that the amazon fire box offers a channel guide for ps vue that the roku does not, which is def a helpful feature to have with ps vue."
1,Nice for all the basics Would have been nice to be able to download a mp3 music downloader
1,"I purchased one for a family member after listening to a friend tell me all of the ways in which he used his own Echo. It is easy to set up and extremely convenient. I liked it so much, I decided to buy one for myself."
1,Christmas present they liked it very much would like.
1,"Easy to read under different lightning conditions. Soft glow of the light at night makes reading before sleep easier on your eyes. But what I like most of all is this is only used for reading and I don't get distracted checking email, FB, internet etc."
1,Great sound and pretty user-friendly... doesn't do exactly what I thought it did
1,Alexa is awesome! Answers when called every time!!
1,The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.
1,Has everything you need to live stream. I have 4 Apple TV and wish I would have know about the Fire TV first
1,love this kindle. love the backlight in screen as well can read at night in bed without disturbing my husband
1,"I set up the fire and Alexa automatically downloaded and that was good, unexpected. I use it daily for news, sports, and some business research. The home screen is a little much at times and I thought it would be fine but I think I would like 16 gig instead of 8 but I can just pop in extra memory."
1,"For wife, she likes it. Good to read and play games on"
1,"Use the Kindle apps on Android phones and tablets, but apps don't support family sharing. These Kindles are great (and inexpensive) for that purpose."
1,Love the fire stick. So much easier to use than Apple TV. Thinking of getting another for upstairs.
1,"I love the Alexa, it's so convenient, I have it in my kitchen so its readily accessible for music and trivia! The sound is great, love the music choices and the shopping list is a fantastic option."
1,"It is the perfect streaming device for me! I am working toward cutting the cable and with the help of the Amazon Fire, I'm well on my way!"
1,"I do love the Echo. I loved it so much, I bought 2 plus a tap. The only / biggest problems are that some times she doesn't hear / understand me. Also, she doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to my stereo. Otherwise, we use it all of the time."
1,"Compared to Dish Prices, this is a good option. It allows you to customize TV stations to a degree. It has the potential to replace dish in the long run if you have an internet connection."
1,"It sets on the kitchen counter and is used for everything!! Music, weather, any question you ask it, it will answer!!"
1,I now have access to many free movies and TV shows with the provided apps and have additional viewing choices with subscriptions to Netflix and MLBTV. It has turned my regular TV into a smart set.
1,Perfect tablet for reading and browsing on the internet .
1,Alexa is awesome but the only thing is that it doesn't understand spanish.
1,I am not very tech savvy. This table has been very user friendly. I have called for support & the staff were very helpful.
1,It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present
0,I got this to replace the iPad for a child. I am so disappointed by the charge. It dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge. This was after 2 weeks of having the tablet. Low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment!
1,"They both love it! And, play or read all they can."
1,Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
1,"If you are a major Amazon consumer, the Echo should be your first choice spot on. The range across a noisy apartment is great and using it with my Prime account features are awesome. There are quite a bit of ""skills"" you can add to increase the function (for example your alexa can ring your phone if you need to search for it, or use it in an emergency to contact a loved one), works great with Hue and Wemo and I actually use it regularly for shopping lists, weather and other entertainment/news updates. Adore my Echo"
1,I really enjoy the fire tv and all the perks that come along with having fire tv such as the variety of free subscriptions and many options to choose from
1,Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
1,"This is the best thing I have ever bought, has amazing sound better than my Bose, she gives answers to your questions is fun to have takes very little space Love it ‼"
1,The. Echo delivered much more than expected. Can be talked to throughout the. Whole house
1,Asked her to play a Neil Diamond song and she played for an hour?
1,I got this because I was interested about the technology. Now I have it read me the news every morning and set an alarm to wake me up.
1,Got this for my granddaughter after her other one was dropped and cracked. She loves that she can watch all her YouTube videos on it!
1,A cheap tablet that is a very good bang for your buck.
1,The Amazon echo is great for a quick information source it's also great for music. My kids love it for controlling lights and spelling random words.
1,"Easy to read fonts, do not have to buy an external light, can read in bright sunlight or in the dark. Easy to add books from Amazon Kindle. It's nice to carry your whole library with you in your purse."
1,My mom loved it! User friendly even for the non-techie!
1,New exactly what I wanted dot dot dot and I always buy from Best Buy when I get the opportunity
0,good tablet for a young person to begin with small to handle
1,"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places."
1,By far the best small tablet for the money that I could ever find. I bought one for my niece three years ago and she absolutely loves it a great buy.
1,"I love this Kindle. It's the best one yet. I've owned the original Kindle, Fire, and Fire HD. Until I bought the paper white, I preferred reading actual books over all E-Readers. E-Reader were just more convenient to deal with. No books to travel with and no need to find a place to store them. I'm now an advocate of the paper white because its just like reading a book."
1,She can be useful if you have the time to go through and set up all of her skills.
0,Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast
1,I'm super impressed with Alexa and how easy it was. Literally out of the box and connect to wifi and done.
1,Bought as a gift. I have one and wouldn't be without it.
1,"I got this to use as basically a speaker, but it does so much more! I use her all the time for setting timers, making shopping lists, turning off and on lights. We are adding more items to it slowly. We are adding more lights, the garage door opener, thermostats. So far she has been just great. My kids even enjoy asking her to tell jokes. I would recommend this to everyone. We love it!"
1,"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."
1,"I own Apple TV,Google Chromecast, Roku and now a Amazon Fire TV. This is great product for Amazon products. If you are looking for the ultimate media player get the Roku. If you are a heavy Apple fan get a Apple TV, if you use Amazon, buy this.They each have their good and bad. I do not like the Apple TV. I only use it for itunes and mirroring my mac. The Amazon fire is great because you can download android apps. It doesn't have as many tv apps as the Roku, but its pretty easy to add 3rd party apps."
1,"As an avid book reader, I have always loved having an actual book. I was very reluctant to get a Kindle at first. However, It has been such a surprise. It's very light weight and thus easier to hold then a traditional book. You can easily download new books at the click of a button. There are daily and monthly deals you can take advantage of for a fraction of the cost of a regular book. The viewing experience is superb because you can change fonts and size and increase or decrease background lighting, making it very easy to read in any light. If I don't know a word I can automatically look up the definition or add highlights or notes. Plus, I can carry an entire library with me where ever I go. I actually read way more now than I ever did before. I am extremely impressed with this device and it's more than exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it to anyone."
1,These went like CRAZY in my high end redemption at the arcade I run.
1,Having a backlight makes this the better choice. Plus the lighting is adjustable for brightness.
1,This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.
0,I thing is cool too can listen to radio get news from CNN FOX but if you don't have Amazon Prime it is dumb as a brick.
1,"This thing is awesome. Connected my Spotify and can tell Alexa to play anything I want. I mainly use it for music. I use the timer feature all the time when I'm cooking, and listen some news and weather most mornings. It's worth every penny. Great product."
1,This ereader is very responsive. It's the best reading experience besides having a physical book. I would definitely recommend.
1,I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
1,"Only difference with this and the echo dot is that this has better speakers. It may be worth it on sale. Siri works as good as Alexa, FYI.Recommend only if you get a really good deal."
1,"I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
1,Decided to purchase this on a friends recommendation and it ws well worth it.
1,"it is cheaper when compared with other kindle models. But not as good as they are. But anyway, still a good choice if you do not have much budget."
1,"I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one."
0,Decent product for the price compared to others in the same price range
1,"This tablet is simply the best tablet you can buy in this price range. Easy to use, decent battery yield, good for occasional use. I use it mainly to read news, read emails, browse internet, see movies on the go, etc. Overall, its a wonderful / good quality product at an unbeatable price, you can't go wrong buying it."
1,"Love love love! No squinting, no glare just beautiful words! Bought one as a gift for an avid reader friend too."
1,Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality.
1,"I bought this for my daughter,she reads books on her cell phone,so i thought she would like something bigger, she also informed me that she can use it for her Master's degree classes cheaper way to order books that she needs."
1,"I purchased Alexa since I have amazon prime. I decided I loved it so much, I bought 3 echo dots to put around my house. I love being able to talk to the air and have things turn on/off, order things on Amazon, play music, listen to the news. This device changed my life."
1,I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.
0,Replaced a v1 nook but this is not better for reading
1,My adult special needs son LOVES Alexa! It's an amazing tool!
1,"Easy to set up. Fun to use, your own digital assistant."
1,Someone who like to begin their journey to tab world that is absolutely one to get.
1,I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too.
1,"This my 3rd Kindle paper white. My other two are completely full of great reads; my eyes are bigger than the number of hours in a day. I don't go anywhere without a kindle paperwhite in my purse; jacket pocket, etc because it's so compact and easy to adjust the size of the print if necessary."
1,Bought this for my sister in law for Christmas. She can't put it down as she loves it so much. Great product for the price. Has everything she wanted on a tablet. Great beginner tablet and so easy for her to use.
1,I like how I can us my ECHO for everything it is one of the best thing I brought.
1,"I like having the option of a tablet. The one thing I overlooked is it did not have internal microphone program, but that only limited the translator apps. My cell phone has the same app, so no biggie. Nice tablet at a bargain."
1,"Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc."
1,I can read it on the beach with bright Sun lite I love it
1,"My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!"
1,"I bought each of my grandchildren 9-7 and it is easy and durable for them. Just don't like that we can't use Google on it. Other than that, they/I love them."
1,"My 8 year old daughter loves it. Easy to use. She watches movies, plays games, and does homework on it."
1,This is perfect for reading anywhere and being able to download books in a foreign country and having them at my fingertips. Being able to adjust the light and font size is very nice. This has been a convenient asset to my life.
1,I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.
1,"Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it"
1,"Purchased this for my fiance's youngest son for Christmas and also to replace his broken ""no name"" handheld. He loved it. The speed, ease of use and size were perfect for him. He mostly uses it for music, youtube and instagram..all of which seem to work fine on it. It was also very affordable. He's happy with it so we are too."
0,i cant at night it has no back light from one to ten its a 7
1,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. It is a great tablet. She loves it and it works great.
1,I actually bought this for a friend. I already have one. She loves to read and I thought this would be perfect for her to download books on. She absolutely loves it for that plus all the other features she can do on her tablet. Such a great buy!
1,Wanted inexpensive tablet for my grandkids and these did the job.Cheers!
1,"It's affordable, great for kids, it's very good.:)"
1,My family love the Echo/Alexa specially my kids you can ask almost anything to Alexa
1,The Amazon - Echo is not just an amazing sound device but offers an always improved upon array of innovative services. My Best Buy for the year so far.
1,It is a great tablet for its price. I would recommend
1,"I purchased this to remove cable, and the crazy high monthly bill. It works great, I don't miss a show, and save $75 a month! We'll worth it!"
1,"Great price, works well for what i needed. No need to spend hundreds on other tablets."
1,This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted ..
1,Proved to be an excellent Christmas gift for both grandkids. They love it
1,"Just gave them as gifts for Christmas. I have bought Kindles in the past and have been happy with them. My only disappointment was when I ordered the Kindles, I paid $49.95 only to have the price go to $35.95 2 days later"
1,It's big then the one I had I would tell my friends
1,"This was my daughter first tablet. She loves it and it's amazing, for the price it can't be beat."
1,I have not stopped reading on this amazon fire. Love it!!
1,Cool way to sync all your home devices and add cool features like music and weather
1,"My daughter is six years old, and she enjoying it."
1,"I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!"
1,"One of the best media boxes I've used. Heavily Amazon based, but works awesome and also has an Ethernet port that makes streaming fast!"
1,Bought for my son for Easter. He loves it and easy for him to use. great for different apps for learning.
1,Best feature I like is that it plays in 4K.Apple tv does not
1,Lightweight and handy to use. Nice one if you love reading and dont want to keep too many books in your bag :)
1,This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps.
1,"i bought this as a gift for my mother in law. she loves it. it does what she likes for it to do, video games, facebook, etc."
1,Takes a while to get used to talking to an inanimate object. Lots of third party apps.
1,I absolutely loved it it is the best thing that I have used since cable
1,Got this for my 3 year old due to it having the bumper and I will tell you it's well worth it. I couldn't tell you how many times its been dropped and survives every time.
1,"I bought one last year for my 1 1/2 years old granddaughter and believe me, she loves it. She deals with it perfectly. We put a 128 GB card and downloaded music, videos and movies. And she finds everything. A few days ago I bought another for my twins grankids. They are only 11 month old but we are going to start putting their music and movies. With the bluetooth they will enjoy it. I got a Free in-store set up so their mom will learn how to use it."
1,I bought this to stream HD music via bluetooth to my stereo. Works great and for the price offered can't be beat.
1,I purchased for my 7 yr old grandson to use for playing games. He is very happy with it. It appears to be a good buy .
1,I bought this tablet for my young grandchildren and they just love it. It is very easy for them to use and can be given a child profile.
1,I like my Echo. It is great to connect to music and ask about the weather and a whole lot of other things. Alexa is fun to have around.
1,Sons tablet stopped working so needed a replacement this tablet fits the bill .
1,Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints
1,"Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo."
1,I watched the Echo on TV and also on Amazon. It has great features and you do not need to use your hands to do a command.
1,Accessable for all TVs in the house and not having to buy a stick for each tv would be 5*'s
1,Great product for kids and adults.Super simple set up that only took a couple minutes!
1,I'm very ignorant of tablets. I bought this for my 2 year old and it has a lot to offer.
1,Awesome! Love it! It was delivered very fast. Would recommend
1,I have enjoyed reading my books on this reading device. I recommend it to everyone I know
1,Echo is lots of fun and our friends will ask if Alexa can come out. Hours and hours of entertainment.
1,"Love this device, enjoying everyday its in my home. I actually purchased another one."
1,"I really wanted a ""value"" item to load & listen to audio books both while at home and on the road. This is PERFECT. So quick and easy to load books via an app or the free library app. Pleasantly surprised....such a great little ""reader'."
1,"My daughter has had an Echo for sometime now and I have always wanted one. I was, however, really surprised when I received one of my very own from my Son for Christmas."
1,"I had an original kindle that finally gave up the ghost after several years of service. I have been using my iPad mini as a reader, but it bothered my eyes after extended use. I like a dedicated reader like the voyager. It is about as close as you can come to an actual book. Love the adjustable backlot screen."
1,User friendly and gives me access to all my streaming services.
1,This has been a great addition to our techno family. Great sound quality for music as well as a great resource for information.
1,The product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music.
1,"I've had this tablet for several months now and have had no problems with it. 8 in screen is perfect easy to hold, not too big or too small. 16GB ROM(about 12gb available after updates and built in apps) is good if you don't have a lot of apps or games. The RAM could be bigger but it doesn't lag even with some medium gaming. 1.5ghz processor is not for heavy gaming, but for everyday use is great. The battery life is excellent I would say easily 8 hours or 5 to 6 if gaming. While this is not a HD display the colors are sharp, some glare if in the sun. Camera sucks but decent for the price, no issues connecting and syncing my data to my Amazon account. If you are an Amazon Prime member definitely buy this tablet and even if you aren't this tablet gives you a lot for the price. I wish Amazon would offer more than 90 day warranty but overall very impressed and satisfied with my purchase."
1,"best portable speaker I've ever owned. I use this everyday, mostly when getting ready in the morning or when I have guests over. Good sound quality and links to the Alexa app just like an Echo. It come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the Echo. Also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord."
1,"designed to serve so many needs-- info, music and more!"
1,I will never pay for TV programming ever again. I love my fire stick
0,Nice sound quality and connects to my iPhone. I listen to Pandora and books and it's great
1,I really love my Kindle Fire I take it everywhere with me.. To the bathroom LOL what I really am pleased with my product I'm planning to get another one for a friend
0,Did not work is good as I thought it would switch to Google home much better product
1,Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet
1,"Have the smaller Fire HD tablet and was looking at the larger tablets but read the reviews and when this tablet came on sale at an extremely great price, purchased this one. Am very happy with it although the photo quality is not as good as my Samsung Galaxy, it is fine in most lighting situations. It's features are good and would purchase it again."
1,Perfect for Home Automation and Wireless Entertainment.
1,i am so in love with this item. it does exactly what it is supposed to do.
1,Bought this specifically to take to the beach and it was perfect!! Light weight & portable!!
1,Bought 3 of these tablets for our household. Everyone really likes the size of this tablet.
1,its a great product its a must have in your household
1,We love ❤️ it!! I just need some help and tips on how to work it!!
1,"I have to admit that I was quite surprised by this Amazon Fire tablet. I have been using Apple, Windows, and Android for the past few years and never gave Amazon a chance - until a Black Friday deal at Best Buy.It is responsive, visually great, and the OS is quite easy to navigate. I set this up with my younger son in mind, and the parental controls are superb. They covered everything I could think of to prevent him from doing. Amazon also has plenty of cases to choose from for their own tablets.The only thing, and this just may take time, is that I wish the app library was more extensive compared to Apple and Android. Other than that, everything else is Excellent!"
1,"The Paperwhite itself is a very nice design and the size makes it portable and easy to hold. The fact that you will be purchasing books from Amazon makes it all the better. Many, many discounted books for 99 cents to 5 dollars. Well worth the price of the reader. Was just on the beach in direct sunlight and no problems whatsoever."
1,Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment.
1,Just cut the cord and switched to ps Vue along w Netflix and Hulu. Cable bill went from $209 to $91 and I get more now than I did when I had cable. The Amazon Fire tv box is what makes it all possible. Once you break the chains and start streaming you'll never go back and you won't miss a thing. One of the best investments you'll ever make.
1,"I can't say enough about the Amazon echo! I can't believe for under $200 you not only get a high quality speaker but a smart home speaker. You don't have to be right on top of the speaker in order for it to understand you. I can be all the way down the hall or in another room and it understands what I'm saying. I have amazon music hooked up to it and its so nice being able to call out to ""Alexa"" to play any song I want. For you ""techy"" people, I also recommend this product. I have slowly been hooking up my entire house to her. Forget setting up a touch device to control the lights in your house. Alexa is more than capable of doing. You do need to purchase additional items in order to do so, but well worth it. I thoroughly enjoy this product and I bought the dot as well to accompany the echo."
1,This was a replacement for one of the original Kindles I used. I enjoy this product much better. Screen resolution and backlight are excellent enhancements. Works great in bright sunlight. Touch screen works much better that old keyboard. Would buy it again in a heartbeat
0,"Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky. Some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection, abruptly stop and begin a new piece. But some singers and ambient pieces will play for hours.Positives: flash briefing, weather, word definitions, Pandora access timer."
1,It works great for reading outside and pretty much anywhere I want to read it.
1,I bought this to replace my kindle white and it's very good
1,Good value for money. Light and convenient. Small and does not take up space!
1,Great for kids with parental features or they would download apps likes crazy
1,"This Kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. Sometimes less is more. No distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. Be aware that you can't read this Kindle in the dark.Pretty simple to operate. FYI there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the USB cord that plugs into the Kindle, and computer for charging. You can buy an adapter separately. If you have the Kindle Fire HDX that adapter works with this kindle. You can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.I recently purchased this Kindle. I do have had other Kindles, and enjoy them immensely.I purchased this one for outdoor use.So far I Love it!"
1,It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!
1,I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.
0,"From the first time I used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. I had to turn it off and back on daily. I tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and I'd have to pay $10. more for a newer model. I bought 2 (1 as a gift). So far 1 works and 1 didn't."
1,I got this for my little niece and she loves it. It's a great value
1,Then what are you waiting for ? If you don't have the money or really not into technology then this product is not for you. I have a iPhone 6s and use Siri not as much as I would like too cuz she doesn't understand me all that great but Alexa? Man she understands every word I say like flawlessly. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the Skills now even tho it's over 3000 skills a lot of them are junk people made I wish more big developers would make some. Should be well known Trivia games in here even if you had to buy them unless I'm not looking in the right place. The main thing I'll prolly use the Echo for is to listen to music it's real easy to Alexa to play a song and it sounds great
1,My son loves his kindle. Loves the layout of software. Easy to download apps. User friendly interface. Bought the 8GB storage but bought expandable external storage to make it more robust. Very durable. Love the child settings to limit use when necessary.
1,"It works will, some time it get slow to switch from Chanel to Chanel."
1,The only thing we don't like is that it had to stay plugged in to work.
1,Lots of programs that I didn't know was available. Quick easy setup and hours of free entertainment.
1,"Amazon echo is an amazing product. I researched and read reviews and they seemed too good to be true. I purchased the Echo from Best Buy for my husband's birthday. It was very easy to set up. ALexa is very charming. This is like having a computer that answers all your questions, plays music, and creates lists. This is truly a wonderful voice recognition device.The sound as a music speaker is great. It's a hit with the whole family."
1,BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
1,this is a nice little tablet. For the money you cannot go wrong.
1,I own this tablet and bought a second one for a gift. There are so many great features on it -has lots of totally free game apps and is a great companion to Amazon Prime service.
1,"This is my first kindle, and I am using it to read, play a few games, although not really a gamer. Over all I am really liking this kindle. Great deal too."
1,echo did as i expected sounds ok just have to be carfull of the name you end up calling
1,I bought if for my husband for our travel. Much lighter then taking books or ipad with us. Took him a little time to figure out the device and how to borrow e-books from our local public library. But now he loves it.
1,My son loves his new tablet. It's a great product.
1,My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.
1,My wife gave this to me for Christmas. She try's to find some tech that I have never heard about. I'm not sure what happened or how I missed this coming out. This is by far my favorite gift in over 20 years of marriage. I was completely unaware of the Amazon Echo. I'm so glad she bought it for me. It's amazing all the things works with it. Thank you sweetheart for buying this for me!!
1,Brand name tablet at a no-name price! Seems fast & the display is bright. And it's backed by Amazon.
1,I purchased this on sale for about $38.Worth every penny and more! Not only do my regular Kindle books look awesome backlit but now I can by or checkout from the online library comics and graphic novels as well as tv episodes and movies. It looks great and (after a year or so) I will be ready to upgrade to HD.
1,This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.
1,This is a great product. Easy to navigate and use with Wifi.
1,"Awesome product! Not a tech savvy person, Easy to use...from setup to uploading and watching my picks of movies, not disappointed in the lease. Saved me money on my cable bill too"
0,Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me.
1,Bought this so I can have 4k from Playstation Vue to my new Samsung 4k tv
0,good one..I liked it..even my kids enjoy this.use it for all games
1,"I've always been a big proponent of real books; love the smell, touch, etc, but I love my kindle. The lighting for the screen allows me to read with the lights off without killing my eyes and it's easier to transport and use when not at home."
1,I would have never though this $35 tablet would have so much for me to do i love it
0,You cannot download any other internet service you're subject to very limited options to do things on it wish I could not have bought it
1,Great for reading in bright lit areas.No glare screen makes it easy reading
1,This is my 3rd Amazon tablet. Excellent reader. I read about 100 books a year so the tablet coupled with the Amazon service makes for an outstanding combo
1,"We are wanting to automate our home and purchasing Alexa(Echo) was the first piece to this pie. We do not have any true automation components yet, but I have been using this to listen to music while getting my house decorated for Christmas. It is sooooo easy to use and it understands requests on the first try. I love Alexa and cannot wait to get a few more products to ""teach Alexa new skills""."
1,"Improvements over earlier 10"" kindles. Only need a case or stand ."
0,Could answer weather questions but struggled to answer anything else. Bought it for my father who is blind. Bing search engine terrible.
1,It was easy to se up but the recipient wished it has an actual manual that you didn't have to download to print a copy. She has yet to use it outside due to weather at this time.
1,It was bought for 11-year-old she seems to like it we will see
1,Really enjoy it . Would recommend it to others. Thanks
1,I am glad that I bought the kindle paperwhite for my daughter. It is easy to use and is perfect for reading anywhere!!!
1,Got this for a Christmas Gift and they love all the things it does. No complaints yet
1,Has all kinds of games and apps for kids. Very fast.
1,"Love my tablet. Only thing I wish, is that the charging cord was longer."
0,Wanted a cheap tablet to read books and comics. I found the lack of apps to be disappointing. It seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy books from amazon or to buy apps.
1,I do like the camera. Sorry that is all I have to say.
1,Best tablet for the price by far. Its also conveint they have it in stock at best buy.
1,This is a great tablet for any user. The picture is beautiful and it is easy to navigate. It is compact and lightweight and simply elegant.
1,Good tablet for the price. Nothing g fancy but my young children like them a lot.
1,"Bought 7"" Kindle fire for my daughter to surf the web and watch videos. Bought 32GB microSD card, loaded videos and install apps there as the device only has 8GB RAM internal. This kindle has a known issue with not recognizing the microSD card sometimes, which requires pulling the tablet out of the drop-proof case (a pain), removing and reinserting the SD card until the tablet recognizes it. Time consuming and frustrating. Amazon doesn't seem too concerned with fixing this issue. It's minor really. Video playback is fine, but web surfing on the child's profile for educational sites is slow/sluggish. Not a fan of Amazon's ads all over the place and their app store is limited. For the price, hard to ask a lot. It'll serve it's purpose."
1,I can watch anything any time my daughter likes it .
1,You get to put all of your books right on this kindle and take it on the go with you. It's great just taking one item with lots of reading material on it instead of having to take all of your favorite books with you.
1,"For the price, it's tough to complain but it does occasionally stutter or get slow downs. Overall, you can't find a tablet at this price that will outperform but if you do have the extra money, I would use it for the new Fire HD 8 instead."
1,This is a good speaker and it does what it claims to do. I would recommend it
1,"We absolutely love our Echo!! Not only do the adults enjoy it but so so the kids. The various reminders you can set are really cool! Not to mention you can keep track of your grocery list, have it tell you jokes, the weather and so much more."
1,Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.
1,I absolutely love it. Cut my cable bill in half. So many movies and stations I would never have dreamed of trying
1,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
1,"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
1,The tablet is great for only $50 but certainly not the most touch responsive. It feels a little slow to me. It also irked me that you have to pay extra to remove the ads from the lock screen.
1,This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality
1,Bought this for my 9 year old. She loves it! Very durable and easy to use. Price is great!
1,Great tv app viewer menus are crisp and the content first rate
1,"With summer getting closer, I know that I'm going to be reading outside more often, and my tablet won't be a great choice with sun glare on the screen. An iPad or Nexus 9 may be more powerful than this Kindle, but what good is all that performance if I can't see the screen outside?It's great being able to go sit down at a local park, enjoy the sunshine, listen to the birds, and read a book on the Kindle. The e-ink display is fantastic, and really does look like paper, even in direct sunlight."
1,Amazon makes a good inexpensive talent for basic functions
1,This is my second Kindel. My first one was a Kindel fire. I liked it and I love to read so I thought I would give this one a try. I love this one more!!
1,My daughter love it she don't really brother me it keep her so busy
1,Nice and compact. Better than the older models.
1,Bought on Black Friday for a Christmas present and it has been worth every penny!
1,"I received this as a birthday present and have really been enjoying it. Easy voice interface allow you to talk directly to the Echo to listen to news, music weather. Set up was easy with an IPhone, just follow the steps in the instructions and your off. Amazon is also creating other way to interface with the Echo through home automation. If you have one of the Logitech Harmony home Ultimate remotes with the hub then you can use voice commands through the Echo to launch activities. I really enjoy this Echo!!"
1,It's very nice and compact. Perfect for kids 10 and under.
1,Best Streamer. I use it for sony vue and to works great. This my 3rd Amazon Tv.
1,Purchased for a 5 year old. Perfect for kids and as a first tablet.
1,"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough."
1,"Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features."
1,"Giving these out as gifts this holiday season and couldn't be happier!! Great price point, perfect size and easy to enjoy for anyone in the family!"
1,"I love it. So easy to set up, couldnt believe how fast it is."
1,This item is a great product. Let's me use it for different things.
1,This is easy to set up and what I really like is with the Ethernet connection there's rarely buffering
1,My son received this last year for Christmas. He loves it!
1,"I researched different readers before deciding on the Kindle. I figured I may as well get something that will benefit from my Amazon Prime membership. I am soooo happy I did, I have done more reading since my purchase than I have done in over a year. Highly recommend!!!"
1,"This product is a lifesaver, the quality is excellent and is not difficult at all to setup and use. The abundance of apps you can install is great and it has become a staple in my family!"
1,It's a really good product!! It does just what I needed for a great price
1,Was ok till it fell off table landed flat face down the broke screen my granddaughter threw unit and didn't break but it fell then broke so what good is bumper on unit if that happens
1,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
0,I love dis tablet just wish the screen wasn't crack!
1,"Awsome tablet for the price, baught 4 of them its a steal."
1,This is a great tablet and ereader together. Great for beginner's and all others my six year old son knows how to work this.
1,"Got Alexa for Christmas and love it. Great fun to ask questions but also good for music, listening to books and ordering from amazon. Have not set it up to control anything in the house but am investigating it! Great buy and definitely reccommend!"
1,Great box I like all the features for itHighly recomend
1,My son and I bought my wife the Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and she loves it! This charger is great for trips where we need a charge in the vehicle or while visiting relatives!
1,"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
1,This is my First Fire and I am very satisfied with my purchase
1,Very portable and usable without the eye strain that is part and parcel of using a back lit tablet for prolonged periods of time. Able to read at night without compromising the ability to sleep later due to the suppression of melatonin caused by the bright light of a tablet. A decent cover is a must to protect the unit it is also is easier to hold.
1,Nothing more to say about Alexa except that she is great.
1,The only thing is that Amazon has their own app store and you can not transfer unless you are really tech savvy
1,"My wife uses this daily for weather, traffic, cook timer and music. She loves it"
1,I bought this after my Kindle Keyboard died. I like having a dedicated reader. Its easier on my eyes. Its light weight and fits in my purse with the cover on it. The ads don't bother me. Great purchase
1,My wife might leave me for Alexa. Thank goodness she can't open jars.
1,I love reading my books on it. It is comfortable to hold for long periods of time. I have prime so the music is great. I carry it with me everywhere
1,Bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter. She loved it. Easy to use and excellent display. I am considering one for myself now that I've seen and used hers. Very light also.
1,"Bought this item as a present for my college-age son. Didn't know much about kindles, but my research led me to this model. May not have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive version, but it is suiting him just fine. Easy to use and read, good size. I'm pleased he's pleased!"
1,I love this tablet. It was a great buy. I would strongly recommend buying it. It's a great reader but also good for surfing the web.
1,A very easy to use device. I don't need anything bigger. Just right for my needs. Price point is excellent.
1,"a great product to access amazon with just voice, overall search ability is ok"
1,So glad I decided to purchase this! I gave it as a gift and the person absolutely loves it.
1,I love the eco it has been on of the best things I have purchased in a long time.
1,I love this thing it does everything you can even play games on it
1,Very happy with this tablet. My grandchildren love it!!
1,Bought as a gift. It was a bit smaller then expected but measured as described. Good value for the price.
1,"Since today society is hi-tech savvy, it was only right to get this for my 4 yr old grandson. It's an awesome tablet!"
1,"Kindle is a dependable brand. I only trust iPad, kindle and a galaxy tablet. But none of their prices can ever match the value of the kindle"
1,"I have owned Kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle. All this being said however, My son and I both very much enjoy what the Kindle's do have to offer, so they get a GOOD rating because of this....however because of the issues I discussed it was difficult to choose between an AVERAGE and GOOD rating."
1,its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
1,"I cut my cable. Easy to use, easy to install. My son did it for me, but I could have by myself."
1,The Amazon Fire Tv is simply awesome. It has over 50 apps for watching tv shows and movies. There is nothing that this thing does not have when it comes to streaming apps.
1,"Anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this. The sound quality is excellent, it is easy to sync via Bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wifi. Great product for the price and perfect for the office."
1,"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
1,"Both my Boys, ages 3 and 7 absolutely LOVE their tablets! I couldn't be happier with them and very satisfied with the price!"
1,Once you get a stable and reliable internet you're good to go !
1,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
1,Practical and easy to use. Does what it needs to for the price
1,"This is probably my favorite device in my home. Whether you only want this for music playing or if you want to make an awesome voice activated home automation system, do not go with any other brand. Alexa is amazing."
1,Bought this for my wife because she wanted to be able to access her Amazon Prime content. It has a beautiful picture and streams great.
1,"Buy this Amazon box and side load Kodi - so you can get free tv , box office movies and more ... Google Kodi and watch a video"
0,I did the preview about this tablet before I buy it. It is a good tablet for the price and it's not too heavy
0,"If you're already fully committed to the 'Amazon' ecosystem - as in: you have a Prime account, then this is a decent buy. I found it hard to get used to having advertisements in your face, and all the Amazon branding you see everywhere. Aside from those annoyances, the device itself is quite sleek and works fine for Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video streaming. Playing files directly from a USB drive or MicsoSD card was a bit clunky but still do-able. An active internet connection is required to use most features of the device."
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is the best bang for your buck when it comes to purchasing an E-reader.
1,"The 7"" Amazon Fire tablet starts up and loads application real fast and works wonderful. The battery life is not as long as my 7"" Fire HDX."
1,This keyboard works as a case as well for your ipad and when attached seems just like a net book...I really like it I think I will end up buying another for the mini ipad...
1,Gave these as gifts for Christmas and everyone loved them! The are small and full of fun
0,This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
1,The sound is not great. Music sounds muffled. Not a real needed I'm but fun.
1,Works great and am enjoying it daily. I would buy another unit anytime.
1,"Bought it on sale, great for reading Kindle books, but is rather slow. Still a good buy for a really cheap tablet."
1,It's great. I use it every day. Love the voice commands.
1,So easy to use and like the hands free feature. Good clear sound from the speakers.
1,I love using Alexa but it's hard to get information from her sometimes and she says she doesn't know it...also hard to keep the outlets working with it.
1,"I love my Amazon Echo, don't know why I didn't get it sooner."
1,Works perfectly! Couldn't be more pleased.
1,"I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick."
1,The paperwhite is significantly better to use for reading than any other brands.
1,i love my tablet. would shop at best buy again no matter what i need
1,Bought this for my wife for Christmas. Fun gadget.
1,So far so good. Compatible to my things and very responsive. Way better the. Using Siri lol (still love apple)
1,I originally got the Amazon Tap. I had read the reviews that mentioned that the sound was hollow with no bottom. That was correct. I returned it got the Echo and there is a big difference. The only problem is that it does not have portable power pack. I have seen 3rd party source and I'm gonna try it.I highly recommend this item. It is all that it claims.
1,I like the fire tv better than the firestick because the connecting the ethernet cable helps with buffering
1,very fast amazon stick replaced my apple tv 2also installed apps with ease
1,had the larger paper white replaced with this model. LOVE IT!
1,I think this is one of the coolest devices on the market. Things I like the most is that you can control all of your smart home devices with the echo.
1,I love the size and light weight. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Lightening quick download
1,Excellent product. Tones of fun and super usability.
1,An excellent tablet for such an affordable price!!!!
1,"Purchased as a gift, the recipient is very happy and surprised with the performance, thinking of buying another one for myself."
1,Love my new paperwhite Kindle reader . Easy to read anywhere with touch screen pages and built in light.
1,I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon.
1,"This tablet was SO easy to set up, even this old technologically-challenged grandma did it without help! I am able to load many books on it. It is convenient and easy to handle."
1,"What a way to enjoy all the entertainment in your very own house, I highly recommend that you get one too!"
1,The Fire TV is so simple to operate. My family and I have really enjoyed it. I recommend you buy it.
1,"This is one of the first products that I have purchased that works better than promised, It integrates with just about all home automation and is a great source of news and local information. It is so easy to use my wife even uses it...."
0,If you can afford to get the HD versions I would go for those; however this is a great starter kindle. Love all the parent controls!
1,Great to listen to music and get news during the day.
1,"Having so much fun asking questions, getting the weather and best of all playing the music I want"
1,Best then Siri. This is my 3rd purchase. Got a dot and a tap as well. And they all working inside the same house in different rooms.
1,My whole family is enjoying our Echo. We try something new almost every day
1,Great kindle for everyone who loves to read highly recommend and what i like is you can enlarge print to fit your needs.
1,This was a big help in cutting the cable cord - its great saving money
1,"My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!!"
1,I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
1,"When I first heard that Amazon had released a budget tablet, I was skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed. Boy did I have the wrong assumption, this product has exceeded my expectations and then some. The screen is responsive, the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down, it's just all out impressive. Front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. Games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. Games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen. Okay for the price, and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablets."
1,Easy to use and work great with amzn prime. Lots of flexibility. Not as slick as Apple TV but at half the price a great value
1,Love my new Echo. Ask it questions...get the answers. Want music...tell it and you get it. Sound is really good and listening to my voice is very good.
1,Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
0,"Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money"
0,"I tried giving this a chance being that I'm an Amazon Prime member but in comparison to my 4th generation Apple TV, it falls way short. I really just wish Amazon would develop the app for tvOS."
1,I love my new echo has a super loud clear sound. Also is so useful just being able to ask and getting answers when your hands are dirty or caught up doing something else.
1,Permanent offers of games are a nuisance. But the reading experience is very good.
1,Easy to use and lots of features. Would recommend this item.
1,"My son loves his tablet, it is very inexpensive and works well. I only paid $50 for it"
1,"If you're already a prime member, than this is the streaming device you want to go with. With HD/4k streaming, you're set with any selections the apps you use have."
1,Love this tablet I got for both my young girls. They love them use them for games and learning games which all seem to be free for the most part.
1,Very easy to install and use. Will be saving us money in the future.
1,"Works well with Amazon's services, hands free Spotify and news too. The speaker sounds great centralized in a large area, and the voice recognition is extremely accurate. Looking forward to getting into the home automation aspect soon."
1,Still discovering the many uses for the Echo. So many uses being discovered daily!
1,Love this tablet. Great price and does everything Iwas looking for in a tablet
0,The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.
1,Hook-up and set up is simple. You are able to watch TV quickly after set up! I was pleasantly surprised by the app options. I no longer miss having satellite!
1,Biggest and best Kindle yet. Light as a feather. Buy one today.
1,The night reading light works great. I don't keep my husband up with a lamp on. It is so easy to order books on line and it gives me new authors that I wouldn't have known about.
1,"Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend."
1,I like this reading device. I use it almost everyday. I read more books now.
1,The Amazon Fire is a perfect buy and at a great price! What my son loves best about the Fire is that it has a camera (the older version does not). I would highly recommend this the Fire!
1,The Amazon Fire tv is a great way to watch your favorite shows and movies. It's easy to use and the best part it was not too expensive.
1,"Fun to play with, a great source to gather information from without cracking a book."
1,"My daughter has been wanting one for quite sometime! I love the durability, and that I can set limits to what she does!!"
1,So glad I bought this!! Nice to have my books right there..so easy to go from one to another in a series.
1,"I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents because I got one for myself last year and really liked it. I take mine everywhere, on the beach, to the doctors office, to my in laws and Las Vegas just to name a few places."
1,"I have for decades an advocate for hardback books. Over time my biggest concern now is space. The Kindle device is perfect for travel, long wait lines and for pure volume of collections. Unfortunately in todays fast paced electronic age there is not a lot of room for hardback books. Kindle has solved that problem."
1,"This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet."
1,I got a really good deal on the tablets. My kids love their tablets.
1,Good product for the price. Screen resolution is decent. Love the external memory card slot.
1,Easy to use with a ton of features. Great resolution.
1,Connected to WiFi with no issues. Streaming is smooth and error free. Good alternative and being an Amazon Prime member a lot of things are free.
1,Read reviews and thought I would not want this. Price was good and the product works.
1,My wife purchashed this. It will be perfect for traveling...read books...check e mail ..... surf the web.
1,This is such a great invention! I mainly use it to play my music.
1,"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account."
1,Great product works direct with internet access or through your phone
1,This tablet is wonderful and a great value. It's performance is fast
1,It's just what I wanted! I love that I can listen to what I want without using my phone
1,Works great with the dot across opposite ends of the house.
1,"Good deal, great product, a nice little addition to our home!"
1,"The kindle fire is great. I bought one for my husband when the old kindle quite working, then I bought one for my daughter to replace the iPod she lost. She loves it. I love that you can add extra storage with a mini SD card (something you cannot do on apple devices)."
1,My 5 and 8 year olds love these tablets. They are able to play age appropriate content. Tablet seems well powered and the case is providing good protection.
1,"Got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! Lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. What really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that Amazon offers!"
0,"I bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party. When it was removed from package and turned on, the image was cracked like the screen was broken, but screen was not broken. Best Buy washed their hands of it and said to call Amazon. I did and had to go through over a week's worth of calling them to get it replaced. Best Buy lost me as a customer over this. If you buy this from them, make them open it before you pay to verify it works."
1,Great for kids. I love that i can monitor my kids.
1,"This Amazon Fire is better then I expected. It does exactly what I need it to do. Fits in my bag, very light weight. Love that I can carry so many book on one device."
1,Bought for mom loves it dependable and tough enough..dropped 2 times and not a scratch great item
1,"I purchased this on a whim but am now really enjoying this, there is so much you can ask Alexa and the speaker sounds really good. You can even ask her to tell you a joke, it just makes you smile."
1,"Not bad, especially for the price. Mine had one dead pixel in a prominent place that was pretty annoying. I ended up returning it and buying a 10.1"" Lenovo tablet."
1,"Easy to set up, controls multiple devices and has a great sound. I like it"
1,My kids play games and watch videos. Perfect! Fast enough for what we need.
1,"This review comes with a caveat. Many tech sites say e-readers are dying, kind of like the ""Nintendo is doooooomed"" crowd, or the GPS is obsolete argument. I don't disagree. As our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tablet-like proportions, dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo. But sometimes, if you're interested enough, a dedicated device is precisely what you need. I had (key word: ""had"") an ipad mini 2 that I had been using as my all-round in-bed Netflix + reading machine. Except I'd get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up. As I spend more time reading on my ipad than watching Netflix, I decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles - one for my wife and myself. The new Kindle Paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model, but the resolution is now 300 dpi. The e-ink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe, and in my personal preference, I like that.The battery is rated to last 6-8 weeks on average between the various tech sites, which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles. Yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet, but it's not very noticeable and I don't find it distracting at all for reading.Cases aren't nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad, so you've basically got the standard Amazon-branded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like Ebay.I enjoy reading, and I frankly don't want to wear any thicker glasses than I already have. Backlight can cause bad eye strain, so that's another plus for the Kindle over the iPad.In summary, TL;DR: if you want a dedicated e-reader, you can't go wrong with the Kindle PW. The price:performance ratio is much better than the Voyage IMHO.But that's assuming that you're somebody who spends enough time reading to make the Kindle device worth carrying. If you only read for a few seconds here and there, adding an extra device to lug around isn't for you. So like a Garmin, the market has a specific niche and YMMV depending on your needs. For me, the Kindle was a great fit."
1,This product is great. The customer service is great
1,My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!
1,I had the firestick before I upgraded to the fire TV and it processes so much faster than the stick. Plus it is true 4k picture quality.
1,One of the best products on the market.its amazing how well the Echo works.The technology that its using is some of the best I've ever used only Siri is better. I lover everything about well worth the money a I give it five stars.
1,"I purchased three of these tablets as Christmas gifts for my kids. It was a great deal since Best Buy had them on sale for $33/ea. They were very excited to get their own tablet. The 7 inch is a bit small for my taste, however, great for kids. The Amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account."
1,Perfect for reading in all conditions with great battery life
1,"Easy to use and setup. Great option to have for kids. Netflix, Disney Jr, PBSkids all are available for download."
1,"Thought this would be too bland for an 8 year old, but he loves it. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept him honest."
1,It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need.
1,This was a great gift for any teenager you have access to a great library.
1,She is fun and intelligent. I definitely see her replacing google as a search engine.
0,It's amazing how much this inexpensive tablet can do. Slower than my iPad and I wish it had vudu but can't complain with a price tag under $50.
1,"Loving these tablets. They keep the girls busy. For their age, best Christmas present so fat"
1,I needed a second charger (for traveling) for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger. This worked great. It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours.
1,Our family has made a echo a part of our ordinary day to day life from playing music to asking questions to just playing with the thing
1,Love my fire box. Already had the stick and loved it so this was a no brainer!!
1,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. text show very sharp and clear and there are a ton of kindle books to buy and read. very well made.
1,My second Echo. Working with a Smartthings hub and various automation devices. Works well and skills are growing in number.
1,"I have 2 my other paperwhite is a first generation and didn't hold up so well after the update. This one is great it's quick and brighter. I love the weight on it, doesn't seem flimsy. I got it for $80 will my discount, so it was a steal!! I love to read, I go through 4 to 5 books a week at the most!! I will be sure to put this thing through it, but I know it will be able to handle it!!Maybe next time I'll do the oasis!!"
1,Got this for my wife for Christmas I think she will love it great value for price
1,I like it because you can hardwire it. works a whole lot faster then the stick.
1,Great device that has a long battery life. Gets lots of use.
1,"I currently have it connected to my XBOX via TV in. Used mainly for Youtube, Netflix, Amazon etc. Device is easy to use and quick setup. The Alexa integration is also a great feature when I'm feeling lazy and want to speak commands into controller. If your looking for a great streaming device this is a great one to ownPro:easy setupapp store choicesability to side load appsAlexa IntegrationCon:Sometimes drops wifi connectivity forcing to restart device Apps crash (not frequent)"
1,Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use
1,Product was as described and delivered on time as scheduled.
1,"Bought this for my kid, easy to use. Set up parental controls so they don't shop on Amazon, and it's quick."
1,"This is my 3rd Alexa that I now have thru-out my home. This is one of the BEST products a home could have. Hook it up to your thermostat and SPEAK what temperature you want, ask to turn on and off certain lights, plays music, gives you the weather and a million things more! LOVE it and each room I add one to, just makes it even better. Easy and user friendly for everyone!"
1,"It's actually pretty nice. I bought 2 of them for the kids to keep them quiet around the house or while driving in the car. They've downloaded all sorts of games, and watch movies when they have Wi-FI. Getting started at the beginning was a little tricky setting up a new account, but after that. Everything works just fine. No complaints. I would recommend this product for the little ones for road trips."
1,Replaced an older model that was having charger issues.
1,"DO not waste your time with the fire stick. Get the box, better remote and faster processor. Does its job and great for Kodi."
1,Best Amazon app for purchasing thinks. More memory card use 64 gb or more
1,"At first wasn't sure if I would use this product all that much but now love it! Listening to Howard 100 at any time, and getting the minutes it will take to get to work so I can plan when I really need to leave the house! And the weather response has been very accurate!"
1,First time buyer of an Amazon tablet and it was a great decision. Very easy setup and my mom found it easier to use than the unit it replaced.
1,Good solid tablet for the price. Does alot of things
1,"I was very pleased with the items I ordered from Best Buy. They were well respresented online, thank you."
1,"Good product for the beginner in the tablet arena without spending a fortune, or paying for a name you don't know.."
1,Perfect for price and purpose. I bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iPhone. When she is older she will be able to play games. Perfect size for her to hold. Love guarantee
1,"We love this product, and are having so much fun with it. I can make a shopping list with it, get news, weather forecast , play our favorite music and so many other things that I have yet to discover."
1,"I had always wanted to try one of these out. I finally got my chance while staying with some friends in Vegas. I though it was so cool how you could ask Alexa just about anything and she would have a response. From playing a certain genera of music, to top news stories, Alexa does it all. After that trip I knew that I was going to get one."
1,"the fire tv box is very very fast and has all the TV streaming apps you need to ""cut the cord"". Other streamers like apple tv or roku are not as fast or have all the apps i like. Just avoid the fire tv stick...too slow."
1,"I got the paperwhite as a replacement for my 1st generation Kindle. It has great features, but is still easy to use. I like that it is not backlit like a tablet, making it much easier on your eyes."
1,"El libro electrnico es muy prctico, puedes tener todos los libros ah."
1,It was everything we expected. It was smaller and brighter than our previous Kindle.
1,I got this as a graduation gift for my husband because he loves reading. He absolutely loves it! He loves that it doesn't glare but that it also has a built in light for when it gets dark.
1,the fire box is an Amazon best seller for a reason: it's good
1,The fire tv system was very easy to set up and use. We love the voice function.
1,I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.
1,"I am a believer of streaming TV, especially with the cost of Comcast bills continually going up. I like the fact that I can watch what I want when I want. When you look at what you pay Comcast and AT & T for TV, it makes more sense to look into these Amazon devices in which I have 3 now.. I've personally turned in all of my DVR's to Comcast. I went from $182 to $98 a month. That's almost half. I have the Comcast package just above Basic with internet Blast. Also, if you look on the internet, you'll find ways to get free channels with this device. I'm saving money and have access to more things to watch now. What more could you ask for."
1,at first I was super impressed but there are times when Alexa has voice recognition issues. overall not a really big deal so I would purchase again.
1,"This does what is suppose to do, and I haven't had not over issue with it... I give it a thumbs up!"
1,"Much faster then the tradional fire stick, I highly recommend it over the fire stick!"
1,"Bottom Line: You can stream TV from anywhere. This allows you to bring HD Television Home. Become an Amazon Prime member, its worth it. Prime allows Movies, Music and Shows into your handheld device and home. Never miss your favorite programs."
1,"I bought this Kindle to replace my original Kindle that stopped working when I dropped it. I like that the screen is lit so that I can read it in the dark. One problem is that some games that I had purchased for my original Kindle won't load to this one. I use it mainly for reading, and it works well for that . It is small enough that I can take it with me without being too small to read."
1,"One of my best purchases, way better than Siri on an iPhone."
1,"This is the most perfect e-reader. It is the perfect size. It also has flawless readability with adjustable back lighting. It's fluid and responsive and lightweight enough to be comfortable yet solid enough to feel sturdy and well made. The power consumption/battery life is also wonderful. It is perfect for readers. For those who do not read much, you will become a reader after buying one. This is concentrated non-distracting portable access to knowledge."
1,For Christmas I bought to for my children and they love it.
1,"Good battery life, great screen (your eyes won't hurt after hours of reading), easy to use"
1,have 3 dots and one echo for my boys room...full home automation...
1,"I am very happy with my kindle 7, excellent, useful."
0,I didn't realize that you can't even put Youtube or similar apps on here. Ugh. Had to return product and get a different one.
1,I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas.
1,"This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!"
1,My son purchased this. He is happy with it but says that it has been updated and the newer one is better.
1,A very convenient and easy way to watch tv programs
1,"I have two Kindle Fire tablets, both the 2012 and 2014 versions so I'm rather familiar with them and how they work. For my son's 7th birthday, he asked for a new tablet. He'd been using Leap Pads for the past few years, but was also used to using one of mine when needed. I debated back and forth between this version and the Kids Edition. In the end, I chose this one. In having a kids profile set up on the Kindle, all auto-pay turned off, and being able to decide which apps I put onto his profile, I felt this was a better option. The tablet is quick, good size for his hands, and has enough memory for any of the apps and books I want to put on it for him. We found an awesome case to protect it. For the price, I don't think you could get any other tablet. I am very happy with my choice and will likely continue to choose Kindle products."
1,"I bought this on Black Friday for my wife and she loves it. It's build quality is good and doesn't feel cheap, it has a decent front and back camera, the interface is easy to use, and there's plenty of games/apps to add hours of entertainment. I feel like the screen clarity could be better but for the price; you can't complain. :)"
0,Don't know much about this item. I purchased it on Black Friday for my niece. Hope she likes it.
1,We love the voice command remote. Easy setup. Kids and adults can operate it.
1,Picked this up for my 7 year old and he picked it up faster than i did.
1,I bought this for a 17 yr old.He absolutely loves it.The price for this tablet makes it so affordable.
1,"it's nice but I need to learn more about it because it doesn't do everything I ask of it. I""d still buy it again though."
1,We are enjoying our Amazon Echo. I amazed myself by setting it up myself without a call to the kids! Our grandchildren are enjoying asking for their music selections. Great product!
1,I went back to buy two more for a nephews and aunt.
1,"I bought this tablet with the desire to Root and maybe flash a custom ROM. While you can down grade to a previous version to root with kingroot, you can no longer flash custom roms. Still happy with purchase. This is my 3rd Fire 2015."
1,My mothers kindle paper finally died so I bought her this. She loves it because she can do so much more than just read books on it. Great product.
1,simple and easy to operate; very fun to work with for business or leisure
1,Works very well and easy to set up. Use this to stream DTN.
1,Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
1,"Gift for my wife, she loves it. Reads on it all the time."
1,"purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as I am able to monitor how much he is on it."
1,Purchased for my son for ease of use and design. Would recommend.
1,"Great tablet, perfect for my son. He can have all his games. Great performance"
1,The kindle fire is a really great tablet when your at home or out at your local after school study place. It has great battery life for doing your home work or just reading your e-mail.
1,Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.
1,"I purchased this for my wife after she had seen one at a friends house. She loves it! It stays in the kitchen and she listens to music, sets cooking timers, gets weather reports and overall just enjoys it. It works flawlessly and is great entertainment for our grandson too! I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,"I purchased 2 of the Kindle 7 tablets for our grandchildren. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the tablets considering the price. The grandchildren would always head for my Kindle when they came over, now that they have their own, they never ask for mine. They use them constantly, mostly to play games but they also stream videos, and even use them to help with school work. It was a great buy."
1,I love the amazon fire tablet. It's great for me when I'm going back and forth between home work and school!
1,I am not the biggest reader but this made me start reading again! Really easy to use and very easy to read off at night or in the bright sun. Very user friendly and lots of little things to make my reading experience more helpful and exciting. Originally got the basic edition Kindle without the back light and instantly returned it. Not having to have a well lite room was more than worth the extra forty dollars.
0,Nothing special and not much memory but for $40 it is worth the price
1,Purchase tablet for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She has enjoyed it every since opening it.
1,"For the price, this is an amazing tablet. I was able to side-load the Google Play Store for an even better Android experience. The best of both worlds (Amazon/Google)"
1,"very happy. tablet or smart tv for bedroom. movies,news,games and web browsing. great picture and good sound. best product for price."
1,"The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use."
1,Useful and fun. Good quality. Good packaging and shipping was easy and fast.
1,I bought this for our foster child as a Christmas present
0,My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.
1,Not a great display for watching movies! Reading books on here is very cool
1,"easy to uses , good for young children to uses ,watch moves, play games, read books, would recommend to other"
1,"Speedy delivery, product was in good shape, and it was well liked by the users."
1,Works with all my stuff. Speak and she shall comply.
1,"Primarily use as a music player. Voice recognition is a+++. Now I just have to figure out which devices I would like to control with Alexia (we use ""echo""). Plenty of user created apps available to transfer results for commands like calendar and reminders to my smartphone so I don't have to depend on the Amazon smartphone app."
1,"Awesome streaming device, love the alexa feature!!"
1,Great starter tablets. Got these for my grandsons. They love them
1,I bought this as a first time tablet for my mother. She has really learned to use it freely. The color and size are perfect for her. She uses it mainly to search the internet and check her emails. Great starter. I am going to download some books for her to read as she travels.
1,purchase the box so I can save money because I tired of paying Time Warner. Best decision I made
1,"Nice, fast, easy i bought for my mom and she is very happy.!!!"
1,I am an avid reader. I use to have to pack multiple books on any vacation or trip for business. This has replaced all that. This is my second kindle and I am very impressed. The back light helps for reading at night or in bright places.
1,Reasonable for its price. My grandson enjoys using it and has it going all day.
1,This is an excellent tablet for reading and playing games.
1,I recieved my echo for Mother's Day and I figured it was just another toy for my husband to play with! I am not to high tech savvy but found the echo very easy to use!! I especially like the grocery list! I would highly recommend this product to anyone young or old
1,"It is incredible, so fun, keeps me entertained, keeps my 3 year old happy in parent mode"
1,Very satisfied with tablet and use to check E-Mail everyday
1,Great little tablet for my young family member and the price is right.
1,These were purchased as Christmas presents for my grandchildren. However I did open the packages to be sure they were fully charged and updated. I was surprised at how fast the response time was and how easy they are to navigate. My grandchildren are going to love them!
1,"I bought a generic one over internet and it sucked so I decided to use this one instead and the performance of this is really awesome, and the Alexa helps a lot to avoid type writing."
1,It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet
1,"There is a good amount of value in this device, particularly if you consume content from Amazon. I bought this tablet for my daughter but her primary source of content is YouTube and there is a dearth of quality YouTube apps on the Amazon app store. She mostly uses an old iPhone 4 for this purpose when at home. On the road, however, I am sure she will use the Fire tablet with movies and Prime content loaded up on the microSD card. It is a solid device - I have not encountered any glitches, freezes, or app crashes but it is not used as much as our other devices. I would recommend it if you consume Prime content or you are clumsy with electronics.Pros* Good value (almost disposable)* microSD slot* Underground* Multi-user support* Easy access to Prime contentCons* Amazon's Fire UI* Amazon's App Store* No support for Google apps such as YouTube, Gmail, etc.* Battery life could be better* No stock content producing apps like iMovie, GarageBand, etc/"
1,I use this to access my Amazon Prime movies and Netflix. I like it.
1,"I've purchased 5 within 3 months, amazing product. Have recommended it to all my family and friends."
1,"Brought for my wife, kids took it over! Now am going to purchase two more."
1,I use it in my commute to watch videos. this serves the purpose for me.pros: 1. cheap2. handy3. Good for kidscons: 1. slow if we have multiple things running2. 8gb is not sufficient3. This has amazon store which doesn't have all apps
1,Wasn't sure about an e reader....this thing is great.....battery life is good..I'm getting about a week or more before charging with reading about an hr a day
1,Full of knowledge and easy to hook up. Would reccomend
1,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
1,"I LOVE THE EASE OF ASKING FOR, THE TIME, JOKES, SPORTS NUMBERS AND MUSCI OR RADIO STATIONS. REALLY COOL."
1,Great price fast delivery will be buying from Best Buy again
1,I think that the size and the display a perfect for reading.
1,"This was my third Fire 7"" 2015 to purchase. One for me and two for gifts. The apps in the Amazon appstore are not a numerous as in other stores, but I've got email apps, games, office productivity, everything I ""need"". For a simple to use tablet it gets the job done very well. As an e-book reader it's great, but not outstanding. The screen is not as nice as higher end models, but for the price and quality this unit can not be beat! The speaker is mono and not as loud as nicer Fire units, but again this is a sub $50 unit.I use mine daily for email, web, some simple games, I've even sideloaded a few apps that work great (Your mileage may vary).Expect to like the unit for what it can do and you'll be happy. If you think this one is as good as a $150 tablet, well look elsewhere.All the sub $50 tablets I've seen out there can't hold a candle to this one's build quality and features."
1,"Great with no or low light, good battery life syncs easy"
1,Seems to be sturdy and lite weight for small hands
0,Nice tablet for children - Works well as a gift for the price
1,"As advertised. Works with Nest, spotify. Just wish it would work when on volume 10 (highest) with voice Command."
1,I love that I can set time limits on how much time my kids can play. I love being able to have them read for a certain amount of time before getting to pay also
1,"I LOVE this little tablet, so much I've bought several for gifts. You just need to buy the little 32 GB Micro SD card and you have a fine little tablet, great for streaming, netflix, emails, FB, games, movies, music--anything!"
1,"I want one that the battery life was better than my old one i had.this is just what i wanted and the price was even better,"
1,Great tablet with a lot of worth apps and everything for a low price.
1,"inexpensive, easy to use, good color, light weight."
1,Great buy with lots to do on this product highly recommend
1,"Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
1,"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
1,Easy to use and fun. It's become a part of the family routine.
1,I bought Kindle for my wife because she is an avid reader. She is very happy with the paper white kindle as it is easy to read inside And outdoors.
1,Bought this for my husband to use for the internet instead of his smartphone. It is simple to use.
1,"Runs much better than the fire stick, especially for some apps such as Playstation Vue. The fire stick is more convenient and takes less room but is not as powerful. If you are buying the product for Playstation Due then you will be returning the Fire Stick to buy this one."
1,Once connected to your phone this is an easy to use and amazing speaker sound quality is awesome and it answers any questions you might have love Alexa even gives me fun ideas when I'm bored
1,The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
1,"I like the dim light, it doesn't damage my eyesight."
1,I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.
0,"I purchased this for my husband to play his games on(clash of clans). The BB salesperson assured me he would be able to use it for that. Got it home, turns out you can only use/gets apps from the Amazon store which does not include games like clash of clans. It was already opened and set up so I gave it to my 6 yr old. He plays a few games on it and watches some movies, but would much rather play with the iPad."
1,Great speakers. Wish Spotify would work without having to upgrade to Premium in order to link it. Still trying to learn all the functional features so that I can maximize its use.
1,I love the new kindle. The backlight is fantastic.
1,Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.
1,"Very convenient, not perfect but worth the money for sure."
1,Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books.
1,Great price for this tablet my kids love it and we haven't had any problems with it.
1,I loved it it was fast and great fun for the kids that cannot put it down
1,The echo was super easy to set up and start using. The whole family loves using the echo from playing music to getting trivia and a ton of other things.
1,bought this tablet for my 70 yr mom. so far she is enjoying it and having no issues. it is her first one and she is finding it easy to use and learn new things.
1,Takes awhile learning the product. But once you do it works great
1,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
1,"I really enjoy my e-reader. It is light, and easy to use."
1,"I received my first echo as a gift and enjoy using it every day. From briefings on news, weather, commute traffic, and access to whatever music I want to hear, the echo has a vast skill library which allows owners to do things like play, learn, entertain, and control household devices like lights and appliances by voice. Abilities far beyond the scope of this review. New skills and products that can be controlled using the echo come along almost daily. I have given the echo to friends, and they have all loved it. It has a real ""wow"" factor."
1,My product rating is based on my experience with my own Fire I received last Fall as a gift. I purchased this Fire as a Christmas gift and the recipient seems to be happy with it. I would like to be able to manage the material on the Cloud easier but this may have been addressed with the newer model.
1,I purchased this at Christmas when they were on sale. Works great for what I need it for. Liked it so much bought two more for family.
1,"Integration with Family library a bit tricky in case you have some books kiddos should not see (ahem, 50 Shades....) but the device is a reliable winner! No complaints and 3000+ pages read later there are 2 boys who rediscovered reading."
1,I purchased for me nephew and I must say it's an awesome buy for a kid. The price is good. Picture quality is good.
1,"When we first purchased the Fire TV we watched all seasons of a particular TV show from Amazon Prime. It was great! We got ""hooked"" on the show and watched every episode. The Fire TV is great for this purpose. In addition, we have been watching movies that we normally would have to rent or purchase. Finally, we no longer have a cable TV service, which has saved us hundreds of dollars!"
1,This tablet is great for kids my grandson is sick and he absolutely loves it
1,One thing I like most about the kindle fire product line are the extensive parental controls. The game play seems to be good and movie playback is as well. My kids love theirs...
1,Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It helps with her homework and then keeps her entertained after. Fir the price you can't go wrong at all.
1,I purchased this tablet for my child and it hasn't disappointed. Easy to use and intuitive.
1,I bought this for my wife. She loves it. Pictures taken with the camera are OK but not the greatest.
1,I upgrade from the fire stick and don't regreted because this one is double the speed and works really good for what I need it.
1,A great piece of technology. A wonderful convenience that helps make you day better.
1,I buy this tablet for my nephew and he is happy with it.
1,I have the Amazon stick and wanted a little more speed and storage which this was just great for.
1,I like this device it is great to customize and use it for android development .
1,How about this for my uncle as a present and he loves it
1,"I'm loving my fire TV. I had a fire stick which I've since moved to the bedroom. I like that I can hardwire the box versus using only wifi on the stick. The biggest thing is that PlayStation Vue, Playstation's new TV streaming service, is only available on a few platforms and Amazon fire TV/ stick is one. So now I have my Hulu, Netflix, and PS Vue all in one place. The fire TV is a cord cutters best friend."
1,"Great tablet, I bought 3 for my grandkids and now another for another grandkid."
1,"decent item, alot of ppl i know use it to watch movies and tv shows that are current since they dont want cable. Works well but only if you have decent WI-FI otherwise there is lag. Still glad I bought it!"
1,Like then light. Easy to read outside. Just easier to read overall.
1,The view is so clear & much more enjoyable than the prevoius model.
1,This has been awesome. For my. 5 year old nephew. Keeps him entertained and it works great.
1,"Very simple to set up and use, but positioning in your home is a matter of trial and error so that it can hear commands from all locations. Voice recognition is uncertain at first but the software algorithms learn quite quickly. Very good for streaming radio as the sound quality is quite good for such a small device. Highly recommended."
1,"Replaced Kobo EReader with this tablet, very satisfied with performance and price."
1,"This 7 inch tablet has just enough power to let you do your daily tasks, it's touchscreen is fantastic with a decent display resolution. It will give you everything that you will need from a good tablet. The only downside is the camera. I wish the front camera should have been of attest of one mega pixel."
1,Amazon Fire tv work great when you have family over your house .get great activity for ages 5 to 60
1,"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
1,This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
1,"Too Much Amazon, not enough Google But for $35.00 to surf the net is ok I guess."
1,Bought for grand daughter for Xmas since most 5 year olds now a lot about tablets and had no problem with this very easy to use.
1,I always purchase the fire sticks til someone told me to try the fire boxWish I would have done it first. Love it. Much betterSpeed faster
1,"Great purchase, easy to use. No longer need to use my iPhone for reading."
1,This was my brother's first laptop and he loves it.
1,Offers a lot of bang for your buck. Just started using a month ago and love it.
1,"Great tablet for the girls, they love it. Easy to use and great with amazon prime."
1,"This is an amazing product, my husband and I love it!! This is the future of TV!!"
1,"This is the first Kindle I buy and I was hoping to be a good experience which so far has been. You may not treat this device as a limited tablet since it is not. It's a reader that works just fine for that. If you compare it you'll feel it lacks speed or responsiveness, but remember that this is just a reader and it works fine for that purpose. The extra feature, the backlight, works pretty fine even at dark rooms without leaving you blind."
1,"Bought product for my 6 year old grandson. It's easy for him to read ,watch movies and play games on."
1,Bought this for my Daughter who loves using it. It's lots of fun to ask for a daily joke.
1,I have stopped using my cable box 100%. We watch only a small amount of tv and this does it for us.
1,"Bought as a Mother's Day Gift. This is great for someone who does not already have a tablet, and is a bit uncomfortable with technology. The tablet guides you pretty well, and once we had it setup with OverDrive, the recipient was very happy. FREE LIBRARY KINDLE BOOKS!"
0,"Very slow, freezes frequently but it was 34 dollars"
1,"This tablet is great. Not the best, but it was only$35!!!"
1,"If your not looking to spend a ton of money on a tablet, this is a very nice option."
0,I returned the item because itt was not wireless. It always needed to be plugged in in order to work. Otherwise it was a great product. I was looking for something that could be taken from level to level as well as outside with ease.
1,Best divine for streaming movies and tv show. The wifi and processor are fast.
1,We have an echo a tap and a dot and love them all.
1,"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
1,Great tablet for kids! Easy to monitor kids activity and set parental controls.
1,"I was skeptical about the Fire OS, apart from being a Windows Phone user and then used Android a little on Nexus Tab, I found FIre OS a little annoying and not easy to use. But then just after 2-3 tries you get used to of and works fine. The tab is fast with Quad core processor and good RAM. I was thinking to install Android, I bought two of these so the one which I want to gift someone I'll install Android it, Although I myself will try FIre OS for a while and then decide."
1,Amazon Fire Tablets are great for the price . My kids ages 10 and 12 love the tablets. The tablets are fast and clear.
1,you just cant beat the value here. great having one of these
1,I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
1,The wife and kids love it. Thinking of buying another one.
1,Love this. Had one for the living room had to get one for the bedroom.
1,Processor is pretty quick. Screen resolution is fantastic. So far they have been a great value.
1,We purchased the Echo as a gift. It was easy to setup and works well. The only complaint has been we can't seem to get it to work with the Nest thermostat. Otherwise we love it.
1,"Bought one for myself and my younger sister. If you don't want or NEED to spend a couple hundred on an Ipad or something like that, This is a really good deal. I enjoy using it a lot, and so does my younger sister. Doesn't have all the fancy things the more expensive ones do, but it's not bad for the price."
1,Amazon tv is a great item! I love the fact that it can stream in 4K!
1,My favorite new product that can do anything!! I love my Alexa as an alarm clock.
1,"Best Buy not only gave me great customer service, they were very patient with an ""older"" techie. At 67 I really appreciate being guided by a knowledgeable younger person. I would refer anyone looking for electronic devices to Best Buy."
1,Great product! I have since order 2 Dots. Lots of fun and also informative.
1,I bought this kindle fire because it was on sale. After I took it home i realized I would have bought it at full price. This is a great ereader that you can also use to browse the web. My son loves using this to read his Ebooks and play his games.
1,PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
0,"Died after 120 days....30 days out of warranty. Some no name brand lasted us 3 years before this one. Figured we would get a ""name brand"" thinking that it will last longer. I won't be purchasing Kindle/Amazon products anymore."
1,"Amazon Echo, ""Alexa"" is great! The Echo has a fantastic speaker so when you want to hear some 80s hits or modern jazz or relaxing background music, just ask! It is really helpful for those little trivia bits of info you wonder about when you're watching TV and usually look up on your phone, then end up checking your email, Facebook, etc and miss half of the show. We have HUE lights in 3 rooms of our house which operate with a phone app. They are great (I definitely recommend them also), but it is wonderful to be able to ASK to have the lights turned on when you need to go to the kitchen in the dark or when your hands are full...or at night when you need all the lights off. It's very user friendly, just one app and about 2 minutes sets the whole thing up. I gave it to my husband for Christmas. It's the best gift ever!"
1,Tablet is perfect for someone who needs it does what it needs to do .I bought it specifically to add music to it and sync it to my trucks radio ... Works flawlessly
1,"You give an amazing 7 tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a nice interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I cant imagine not buying these for your kids, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means.I f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value."
1,"This is an amazing product, I can't get enough of it! I use it everyday for hours, never have to pay for movie tickets with this box, plus it is also great for other apps, games, netflix, tv shows, it's up to you!"
1,This speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it's got the Alexa application!
1,Amazing infection by Amazon. No wonder their stock is going up the roof. Very addictive.
1,"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one."
1,"This is a great product! Alexa is always available to answer my questions, play my music & control smart devices in my home."
1,Tried the Roku 3 on a set and recently added this to another. Really like the ease of use and voice search feature. Would prefer less an amazon centered home page - otherwise a 5 star product.
1,You can read books as well as browse the internet. It has cameras too.. Good buy and a recommended gift!!
1,I thought $49 for a Kindle tablet was a fantastic price until the Black Friday deal of $35. I did add a 32gb memory card. Kindle Freetime is great. My 6 year old loves the tablet. Works great with many kid friendly apps. I also put a kid proof cover.
1,"Set up was easy and I use it everyday. I check the weather, sport scores and play games with it."
1,"4K works great, instant connection. Content on fire TV (and stick) are always improving."
1,"This is a rare instance of a product delivering on its promises. The set up is extremely easy and intuitive. Amazon has clearly taken the lead in the home assistance space with Echo. As more compatible products become available, the usefulness is only going to improve."
1,"Excellent product,my children love this item. Thanks"
1,I love how user friendly it is. It was a gifts for my daughter who is not very good with technology. She loves it!
1,"Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games!"
1,"Great bare bones tablet! Great for e book reading! Also, can't beat the price!! no complaints here!"
1,good product for the price..Holds a decent charge and surfs the web just find..I have also steamed videos on this device with no issues.
1,"Reader is lightweight, easy to hold and makes reading much easier--less of a burden with lengthy tomes.Reader is effortless to learn how to use and access other books within our library."
1,"The kindle is lightweight, no glare and worth reading a good book on. They have a good product."
1,"It is a great ""book"" to carry around. I really love it."
1,For the price this is a great tablet kid friendly as easy to use
1,"Bought one for my mom a few months ago so she could have a bigger screen than her phone . Didn't want to spend too much since they are not big on any kind of electronic. Does the job. Good price for this product. Bought a second one for my dad. Only downfall is I couldn't remove all the pre installed apps on their home screen . Besides that, pretty happy with this tablet."
1,I really like the amazon echo I use it mostly for music and askin questions. I also check the weather and traffic updates.I am still learning how to use more options on Alexa.she's highly addicting.
1,Excellent for what I or family want to use it for and the price IS nice!
1,"I got this tablet for my kids to play ANKI Overdrive, works flawlessly as host in multiplayer mode with IOS and Android devices!"
0,"I needed an Android device to run an app no longer on the iOS App Store. I later learned it wasn't in Amazon's store so I had to install a work around. Got the Play store, downloaded the app and deleted the Play store. It wouldn't be my first choice in tablets but it doesnwhat I purchased it for and does it better than I expected. I don't appreciate the lack of security and encryption but I intentionally leave private info off the device so it doesn't impact me."
1,Amazon Echo is a great start to electronic personal assistants. Voice recognition is very accurate.
1,Overall pretty good picture. Picture settings are actually fairly accurate out of the box. HDR 4K picture is great when streaming from Amazon.
1,Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
1,"Fine for children, but a bit difficult to handle with the apps"
1,It's small enough for my daughter to carry around. She loved it.
1,Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read
1,"In a field full of options, the Fire Kids Edition really comes among one of the top contenders. Great parental controls and great array of downloadable content makes this a great stepping stone into the world of tablets for kids. I see reviews that list battery life as a con, but at over six hrs. and for the price, what more do you need. I'm buying this for my four-year old and I'm not planning on her being on the tablet for six hours, let alone 8 or 9, which is what bigger tablets can handle. If you have older kids, perhaps you may want to consider a bigger, more powerful tablet. For the pre-school crowd, this is just a great tablet for both learning and entertaining."
1,Fast response time from unit. Works great. Easy to use. Enjoy watching the device.
1,got this as a gift for the wife. she loves it and uses it a lot.
1,This is a nice simple tablet for the price. Good enough for basics. The graphics are better than I expected.
1,Great device for streaming video. You can side load Kodi and different add-ons to get movies and TV shows for free.
1,Got this for my boy and he loves it plus he had dropped it a few times picks it up and keeps on playing
1,Great for movies or any shows you want to binge watch. So many more options than just Netflix
1,Good phone but my return visit the customer service was horrific
1,I bought this for a raffle at the school I work at. It has many educational apps and the student who won it was thrilled!
1,"I managed to catch it on sale for 1299$ and use a 10% movers coupon to get it for about 1275$ after tax. TV works great and has a good picture, sound is whatever, but it's good enough for me."
1,"You get what you pay for with this product. There are better tablets, but this is a wonderful product for the low price."
1,"Great if you're an Amazon Subscriber. Music, Movies and Alexia to let you know the weather."
0,It wouldn't connect with any of my smart home items it wouldn't understand some commands
1,This product allows is to stream almost all tv shows and movies made. We are able to look at old as well as new shows.
1,I was expecting better battery life cause they claim 6weeks of battery life. I am getting 3weeks. I wish it was little better than that. But that's my only issue
1,I love this and use it every night to watch just about anything I want.
1,Daughter loves it. She listens to alot of music on Echo
1,I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
1,I LOVE my Echo! Everyday there is a new skill or a new app that must have. Of any wait to see other major names start to integrate Alexa into everyday life.
1,"I hadn't bought an ""updated"" Kindle in quite a few years, so as the battery on my old one wasn't holding a charge very long, and searching or downloading anything became a half-day event, I felt it was time. So, off I went and purchased the latest 7"" screen Kindle Fire, and holey moley what difference. This new one is incredibly fast, has a beautiful picture, amazing capacity (plus a SD slot for expansion), and a two-way camera to boot! I'm still learning all the new bells and whistles, but so far this has been great and looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship!"
1,Nice to have for the price I bought it for. Does what I need it to do just not very fast.
1,This is the 4th Kindle we have.my wife had the older one she loves the camera and the size.
0,"As a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android."
1,"This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
1,"Not sure what I can add that thousands of others have not, but the Echo is an awesome device. New features added every week. A must own for anyone interested in the Smart Home movement."
0,This is a basic tab. I bought this for my sister. You can't really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon account and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive. But I was still able to use it for games and internet browsing. I had difficulty using it for anything more. Camera was not the best.
1,Best reader i think for the price. The only thing amazon needs to work on is the user experience. Make it a little easier to use.
1,perfect android box for your living room never miss a movie a sporting event or your favorite shows when you and Kodi just buy it
1,"Work with almost all my automated appliances at home and keep updating adding new products, is a great addition to your smart home."
1,Fairly small screen. But excellent for traveling. Portable and watch lots of movies. Camera isn't great quality but don't use it for that anyway.
1,Easy to set up. Works just as advertised. Wonderful new techie toy.
1,I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks
1,Let's me watch movies on road trips & overall good quality picture
1,It's a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get
1,Love this product and LOVE Amazon! It replaced my old Fire TV.
1,"Very light weight reading device, touch screen is very responsive, not whole lot of lagging. You can adjust the backlights brightness with slide down from top. You can browse what you have on your kindle store or buy more books. Overall. Love it.!!"
1,I didn't know if I would have much use for the echo but the more I use it the more I love it. It can't do some things I wish it could like change the color of my hue lights. But it can dim them and turn them off and on. I like it a lot and my son likes it too.
1,"I bought Alexa for my husband for Fathers Day, since he's always looking up the daily weather forecast. I think I use it as much as he does, I love the music choices and the speakers sound great!"
1,"This kindle is great, perfect size. Easy to navigate. I even purchased two more for family"
1,Bought this for my wife. She subscribes to several financial publications that use graphs. They don't work well on our old 3rd generation Kindle and she hates reading on her iPad. This Kindle Paperwhite is great. It displays the graphics perfectly but keeps the reading experience pleasant.
1,My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
1,Awesome sound. Would definitely recommend this to my family and friends.
1,I enjoy reading on this kindle. It is easier on the eyes then my iPad for reading.
1,Great product. You can see any type progrant. I will reconment.
1,"Awesome tablet, easy to get through! My son love it"
0,Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.
1,Have not used it yet. Salesperson did not sell me the correct cord so I could set it up.
1,The amazon fire TV let's me access all the apps that aren't available on my smart TV. Always quick and easy to use. Great device.
1,I got this for my mom and she likes it pretty well. Over all it's good for the price.
1,"Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well."
1,I was not satisfied with Chromecast because of its limited abilities. Fire TV with sideloaded apps can do so much more. Love it!
1,"Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it!"
1,Good features alexa integrates very well into daily lives also speaker sound is quite good
1,It's fast reliable and easy for any age to play games read or browse
1,"Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!"
1,I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
1,"My old kindle died, so I got a new one. There were only two options available, so I got the one that has a backlight. It's very easy to read on the beach in bright sunlight. And I love the backlight. It doesn't strain my eyes like the iPad does"
1,I read a ton and this had made if much easier for me to have accessible books! The light is perfect for my when my boyfriend is sleeping and I can't put a book down!
1,This was a gift for my niece and she loved it. It is very user friendly and the right size.
1,My daughter gave me a google for Christmas but I returned it because I wanted an echo. Love it!!!
1,"Once it is programmed, it works great! It is a wave for the future for voice programming."
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and I'm glad she shares. It's a pleasure to read books and it's great that either of us can read in a dark bedroom without disturbing the other.
1,"Purchased two of these tablets as gifts to the grandsons. Set up was a breeze, and Mom & Dad especially like the features for younger children. We also added a 64gb SD Card to both for the added storage! Overall, everyone is quite happy..."
1,Does the job Sometimes misunderstands. Need to buy the right equipment with it.
1,Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading
1,"This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
1,Perfect size for on-the-go people. Easy to hold. Easy on the eyes. Battery life is excellent.
1,Is very good tablet for the price is worth it I will buy one again
1,"I heard about the Echo but thought it was another electronic gimmick I really didn't need (hard for an e-junkie to say no). My brother visited a few weeks ago and convinced me it was worth it so we found one at the local Best Buy and bought it. It's odd how many times we walk by now and ask questions. Growing up decades before the internet, I wonder how dangerous I would have been using it when I was younger. Ah well."
1,I bought this to utilize PlayStation Vue. Works well
1,"I'm happy with the product, all works perfect, but the Best Buy employee attitude I don't like, I'm ask for the product and he told me if you don't see here we don't have it, and I ask another employee and he show me the item from another place, a very different attitude.Thank you !!"
1,"The product is great for playing music and placing Amazon orders. However, requests for information receive answers that are very short on facts."
1,Use every day. So easy to use. Perfect size. Will be great when traveling. Love it.
1,Great table does everything that i need it for. Great resolution and screen for reading books
1,Great gift for my sonEasy to useEasy set upLight weight
1,Purchased for grandsons. They were not happy with it because it was not compatible with their iTunes.
1,All the shows and one third of the price of cable.
1,I really enjoy this product. I referred it to my daughter.
1,I got this for my teenager and she loves it. The only hard part was getting it set up for her without giving her access to my account
1,its a great device I bought it for my great niece and she loves it
1,"Kindle fire is great! I already have one myself, so am happy to be giving one as a gift!"
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for a family member. He uses it daily and loves it. Very easy to control next with your phone also.
1,Easily stored very lightweight keeps me entertained
1,Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
1,"I was looking for something within reasoning and saw the ad for these. I purchased them for my two oldest grand-babies and they loved them. I not only enjoy the price that I paid for them, but I can honestly say that my grand-babies are to this day still enjoying them."
1,"Boxed well, easy to set up, and pretty easy to get the hang of."
1,I love it. Does everything I like. The daily joke is also a nice feature. Weather is up to date
1,I bought this one for myself. It works fine. It is fantastic.
1,"The Paperwhite is great upgrade from my old reader. Easy to read, easy to carry (important cause I travel a lot). Definitely worth the price."
1,The tablet is great for my 3 years she loves it very easy
1,If you are an Amazon prime member then amazon fire with Alexa is a no-brainer. No need to subscribe to cable tv when amazon fire has all the movies and apps you need. Try it and you will be hooked.
1,"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
1,was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature
1,Easy to use and love the voice feature. Had roku's before and liked them. Think I like this even better.
1,overall good but does not find 5ghz networks which is why i returned it.
1,Alexa is so much fun. No more searching for my favorite song. None stop entertaining. Great for a party.
1,"I love the ease with which I was able to set up and connect Alexa to the internet in my home. I set an alarm to get up to go to the gym, a reminder for things, ask her the weather and she wakes me with the trivia of the day - which is sometimes very amusing !! I also ask her the news, the weather and what's on my calendar for the day. Every day I try something new and am always delighted with her and amazed by each new attribute of my Echo. I have a Dot in my bedroom as well and plan to add one to my home office. I think I'm becoming addicted to these wonderful and helpful units."
1,"I like this device. Able to coordinate the family calendar.Great for music, news and e-books. Will be setting up some automation i.e. sprinklers and lights. Ordered my first pizza yesterday and created a shopping list while calling ou items with my head in the fridge. Ver esy to set up. Give 4 stars because the device and technology is still growing.With more stuff added this will be a 5. Dad came over and played with it... so I bought him one as well."
1,Great little device. Time to cut the cable. Easy to set up and program.
1,Amazon Fire TV is real easy to setup and use......
1,"First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store. If you want to keep it as is out of the box, I'd recommend staying away from Amazon and going a full fledged Andriod tablet like Samsung."
1,Love that it is voice controlled and is very easy and you can operate stuff here at my house
1,haven't opened yet since its a Xmas present for my 2 yr. Old I love that there is a kids zone area where she can learn numbers letters shapes and has nice thick bumpers to keep it from breaking as well has a warranty if it breaks
1,Product works well and is durable. Great for kids.
1,Easy to set up. Good size tablet. Like the addition of Alexa
1,Nice product I would recommend this to everyone who has it for friends
1,The Echo is everything expected. Lots of fun asking questions and quite handy being that hubby is full of them.
1,"We have had so much fun with the echo! Playing music, sending texts and asking questions! Anyone that comes to our house talks to Alexa!"
1,This is a great little tablet especially for the price.
1,"Great small tablet for kids. Very User friendly, because ugly several to use as give away items for kids ministry."
0,I only bought this because you can't get the origami case in this size. This one isn't as sturdy as the origami case and slides so that my kindle falls down a lot :(
1,"I can control both upstairs and downstairs nest thermostats,play music,set a timer and so much more by just saying Alexia. I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,I know it has Bluetooth but I think it should have had a auxiliary port for older speaker's
1,"I am very happy with the paperwhite. All I wanted to do was load books and magazines on this. Lighting is great, readability is great. Features are mostly easy to use. I'm very happy with it."
1,We were looking for a good tablet at an affordable price. This one has definitely met our expectations and we hope to use it for a long time!!!
1,Not the best sound for music but it'll do. I don't like that it has to be plugged in to use. Wish you could charge and go.
1,"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
1,"I bought this Kindle 7"" fire for my granddaughter. She has used my fiire HDX and was used to the format, so it is working out great for her. Still I wanted something inexpensive in case anything destructive happened I would not have much money involved. We are very happy with it."
0,"I totally love the Kindle Fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. My sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. She is equally happy. My granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games. In addition, they want a dog and conduct research for the type of dog that the would like. Overall, the tablets are easy to use and provides technology for them when they visit every other weekend. I am pleased."
1,This an awesome tablet for kids. My Grandson never wants to put it down. The case is great protection from drops.
1,"It is an affordable tablet and thaks to Amazon, you are able to have a variety of music, games and films."
1,I had no idea how great of a purchase this would be for my family period I am the father of 4 girls and this device is used more than any other device in our home. Because of it our home is filled with more music laughter singing and dancing than ever before.
1,Works good for the cost. Bought this for my dad and he loves it.
1,"I love Alexa. She keeps a shopping list for me, schedules appointments plus plays my favorite tunes! And so easy to work with. A must in every home."
1,I purchased this product for my 8 yo for his birthday and it has been perfect!
1,"Alexa is a great product. She seems to know everything, whether its math, music,sports, it just doesn't matter. I think my wife is jealous of her because I spend too much time with her(Alexa)."
1,"Works great as an e-reader, lots of apps and is Good for basic web browsing."
1,I just ordered mind 5 minutes ago is this the newest edition the 2015 kindle some of my friends got this and I heard it is such a great tablet
1,I had to replace my last Kindle so I made a quick run to Best Buy. Got a great deal and purchased the replacement insurance. Kindle works fine. It is slow and needs to be restarted frequently. Pretty much the same as the last Kindle
1,This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
1,We bought this for our five yr old. We bought a case with a handle from amazon making it fairly durable. He enjoys the games. It is fairly easy to use and he is able to navigate on his own. I really like that you can set parental limits on it
1,I bought this tablet for my 10 year old grandson. He loves it! It is very easy to operate and has a great display.
0,"This is a good tablet for the price, however, it runs slow and the touch screen response is not the best. This isn't the right tablet if you're looking for a high speed, high performance tablet."
1,Great for the cook or germ aphobic in your life...hands free...very fun and handy..awesome music
1,This is a good tablet for a great price. Good starter tablet.
1,With the newer 300ppi screen the Paperwhite really hits the sweet spot in the Kindle lineup.
1,"My dad, 79 years old, is able to navigate this item easily."
1,Excellent tablet. Great product. Deliverd on time.
1,I have and Echo and order all the time no problem. Nice way to order if you don't have much time.
1,"I was so excited to get this cool new tech toy in my home that would make it easy for me to enjoy the music of my choice. I never gave a thought to all Alexa would do for me. First of all. The set up was like 1,2,3. Once the app was downloaded it was a piece of cake. Alexa is like my personal assistant, she makes appts, shopping lists, wakes me up on time, finds the recipe I'm looking for and so much more....all I have to do is ask. I can't wait to get the adapters to make my home into a smart home."
1,"What can I say, the family's been going crazy with Alexa. Having her calculate math problems, asking about the weather, setting timers, playing our favorite songs on command - it's been great!"
1,it is set up way more like tablet then then the old kindles
0,Did not work right out of the box; bad hard drive. Read other reviews that stated the same issue. Would not recommend to anyone. Save your money.
1,Great overall. Easy to use and navigate on. Charge the battery fully and it doesn't last long. Only used for nightly reading mostly and the battery needs to be charged daily. Not thrilled about that
1,for the price of this box you really cant go wrong
1,"Amazon's Free Time is a great tool for parents, making this a very good tablet for young kids. You can control when the Kindle turns off at night and when it can be turned on in the morning. You can control how many hours it can be used before shutting down, or you can specify hours by activity--books, videos, and apps/games. You can even set goals, such as 1 hour of books before allowing videos and games. And you control exactly what content they can access. And when your kid's not using it, you can use it yourself with your own unrestricted profile."
1,I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is everything I expected and more. Great price for a beginner tablet.
1,Got for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!!!!!!
1,Very nice matte screen that's easy on the eyes. If you want a eBook reader this is the best one
1,This tablet is great for what it is! They were presents and they love them!
0,Not very functional and never had all the answers I needed. And I wanted a device I could make phone calls to anyone with in which the Google home does. We purchased the Google home and we are so glad we did.
1,For the price it should come with a hdmi & wireless keyboard.
1,"I had a couple of their first renditions of the Kindle. This one has a better keyboard, screen and is faster."
1,The tablet works well. Do wish it play store. It is easy enough for him to use.
1,I'm loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more.
1,"So far I have enjoyed my Kindle Paper White E reader.It is light weight, easy to read inside or outside.The battery life so far is fine.I had to order a case & charger directly from Amazon, could not find instore to fit"
1,"Not an iPad, but that's not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do."
0,Won't load or be compatible with some games sold by Amazon.
1,This a 4k amazon fire for 4k TVs. The image is just fantastic!
1,Always a big fan of Kindle. This is my third one to purchase. Why so many you may ask? I never get to use them because every one else in the family grabs them. Great for surfing amd reading books.
1,I bought this to run Playstation VUE on. No problems with the unit.
1,I got this tablet to watch movies and stream Netflix and it does it flawlessly. The battery life is not very good but otherwise a great tablet for less than $50.
1,"Works great, he can enjoy his apps without interruption. Now we just need one for his younger brother since the only negative thing is that he wants to take it away every day."
1,"I have been playing with Echo for a couple of weeks. Its well worth the price want to hear a special song just tell the Echo bang she played it, sports scores you name it she got the answer."
1,"I am loving my new kindle fire! It is so easy to use, and downloading is a breeze! The connectivity is great also"

1,Bought this Kindle Fire tablet for my 8yr old and she loves it.
1,"I have an ipad, and though I can say this is no Ipad, it works great...especially for the money. Never touch the ipad any more and even bought some of these for my kids."
1,Great little tablet for taken on my commute to work.
1,It is really easy to setup & to connect to. Really easy to select programs
1,I purchased the amazon Fire Tv as a way to save money by canceling my cable subscription which was around $150 a month. I used it on my old Samsung tv and purchased a subscription to Netflix around $10 plus high speed internet $40 and side loaded Kodi free for a total saving's of $100. so far I've purchased around 5 amazon fire tv's.
1,I would recommend it..very durable and long lasting!
1,My grandson can operate the kindle fire with no problem. Just the right size for his little hands.
1,The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.
1,My wife reads a lot and thought this would be a good gift. Being a Prime member as well as her signing up for Unlimited she can be reading something anytime which gives me time to play video games!
1,I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
1,This is just what is advertised on the box. It was very easy to set up and use.
1,Really enjoy being able to use alexa to voice control everything.
1,"What's not to love about this item - You'll need a smartphone to set this up (app based) - and then the sky is the limit (we control lights, temp and a few other things in the house as well as listen to music via spotify)I love these items - Speaker is decent (I'm used to bose, denon, etc for sound) so given the size of the echo - the sound output and quality is below that of my BOSE 123 (but it cost lots less and is much more functional)"
1,finally I can read on the beach or outside! I can take many books with me when I travel without the weight and bulk of paperbacks I can also enlarge the font size so no readers are required!. Love this device. Wish they would do something like this for cell phones to read in the sunlight!
1,I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.
1,This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
1,Have to have to charge the book.
1,When you compare the Kindle Voyage 6's Screen to the other model. The Screen was brighter for reading
1,Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn't really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV.
1,"I love my Amazon Echo with Alexa. Very cool item. This one is going to be a house warming gift for a friend from college. I own two, and gave several of the Echo Dot's as Christmas gifts last year. The more you use it, the smarter it becomes. The price right now is EXCELLENT !!!"
1,My husband is an avid reader and what better way to reward him for his love of reading(and playing games lol)
1,Great product. Very light and fast compared to its predecessor.
1,I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint
1,Perfect first kindle easy to useeasy for kids!!!
1,This device works as advertised. The voice command on the remote is the best I've seen. Worth every penny.
1,Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!
1,"Got this one for only $ 35, added a 64 GB Micro SD and a nice cover. It's not an iPad, it's not Nexus, it doesn't run Android (well, kinda...), but I got a high quality and well equipped tablet for less than a hundred dollars."
1,"It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer."
1,Great value for a tablet. Was a gift for dad in his fifties and it is simple enough for him to use and play word games and watch Netflix and stuff. Got it on sale for $39 which was a steal. I should have gotten another one for that price . Best Buy always has great prices and selections especially when they go on sale. Dad loves his Amazon tablet.
1,Order two and love them. Great gifts for anybody get cases for them
0,Did what I needed it to do took back to get a bigger size
1,"The only issue with this kindle is the price, otherwise, it's awesome. Light, compact, with a long battery life and tons of features... like an automatic backlight which is useful if you read at night."
1,Love the fire tablets! I have 4 of them and they are all amazing. My kids love them
1,There are many things I love about the Amazon Echo. It reads me the news every morning. News that is tailored to my interests. It will do simple calculations or set reminders and alarms. But most importantly it interfaces with my Smartthings hub and allows me to control all the lights and electrical devices in my house as well as the temperature with my voice.
1,I love this kindle. Everything is so much bigger and good for road trips
1,Very easy setup. I love the voice control for searches.I am an Amazon Prime member
1,"As I said, The item worth more than the price. It was emailed/introduced to me by bestbuy.com and I am lucky to buy it."
1,You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
1,We love our echo so much that we bought another one for upstairs!
1,I love the Fire. It is great for reading and watching movies. I added Amazon Prime and this made it perfect!
1,This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
1,Got it for my future mother in law as a christmas gift she is enjoying being able to read books online
1,i was skeptical but glad I purchased. much faster than Nook or the paperwhite. Thin and easy to use. Screen appears brighter and wider than the paperwhite. Very thin and lightweight
1,"Easy access to books and the web, just annoying ads."
1,"Upon using a few other android devices, I settled on this. The software is perfect, snappy, and overall awesome. Very easy to set up, just sign into your Amazon account. Much much faster than the fire stick itself. That is how you can justify the cost. If you are looking for an android style device look no further than this!"
1,"I'm currently in love with this item, setting reminders! Also playing music with spotify and bluetooth!"
1,Can't wait to make a clean break from cable company.
0,"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store."
1,Easy to use. No technical issues whatsoever. Great value for the money
0,"For under $50, it's cheap and so so with stocked firmware BUT you can root it then put a new custom firmware on it, After such you are no longer have many annoying pop up and adware from Amazon and I feel like my Fire Table is now worth at leat 2 times more than what I have paid for it."
1,Satisfied so far. Look forward to the updates. I would purchase again.
1,"Only problem is when you go to the next page, it sometimes goes 10 pages at a time."
1,My puppy chewed up the power cord that's came with my Alexa. So relieved that I could get a replacement at a reasonable price.
1,"I wanted to buy a Tap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Alexa enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphones.Sound quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. This is currently the most flexible implementation of Alexa and I recommend it."
0,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
1,Nice tablet for the price. Very easy to use and understand.
1,I bought this item ad a gift and would buy it again hands down.
1,Runs flawlessly...Love The Fact It's Not Just Wi-Fi Enabled
1,I got this for my class! I love the setting for it! I have a child account so my students can only use the apps that I put! Awesome tablet!!
1,Love this! Having a great time learning all the new things it can do. Also love that Amazon and Best Buy send me emails about once a week with new things to try. Be careful to check and make sure that Smart Home products actually are compatible before purchasing them to use with Alexa.
1,"I got this box specifically for Kodi, and Amazon prime, and I have not been disappointed! Super fast and no buffering! Love it!"
1,"I initially bought the paperwhite for myself, but gave it to my husband. I had read about the voyager, and they said it wasn't necessarily worth updating from the paperwhite, but if you were buying your first, go for it. It's a bit thinner and lighter, supposedly has a bit better font (don't know about that)."
0,"Can't download ""TCM"" nor my Cable providers "" tv on the go"" app"
1,Battery life is awesome. Works great with the lights off and goes to sleep after a few minutes of non use
1,"Perfect tablet, such a great price would totally recommend"
1,Great tablet for the money kids love it great sound ease to use
1,"I Purchased Three Of These For Family Members As Christmas Gifts On Black Friday For Only $34.99 each!!Pros ; Price Is Great, Responds Well To Touch and Running Applications, Small, Portable, Again The Price Is The Best Pro To This Tablet.Cons : Main Homepage Runs Ads In The Background?? Why?? , Apps Are Only Available Through The Amazon App Store Making A Very Limited Selection Compared To Google Play and The App Store For Apple But Again This Equal To The Tax I Paid On My iPad Air."
1,Everyone should have an Alexa in their home. She is like part of the family!
1,"I recently bought the Amazon TV because my PS3 was having difficulties streaming Playstation Vue. Therefore, the primary reason I bought it was to stream Playstation Vue. It works flawless. Additionally, after setting-up Playstation Vue, I began to download a ton of different apps and use it a lot more and for a lot more streaming services then I had originally planned. I would for sure recommend it for anyone wanting to stream any shows. It is a excellent device and easy to use."
1,The Amazon Fire TV is a quality product at an affordable price. Less expensive than Apple TV and more capable with a good app eco system. Also able to stream UHD.
1,"I love the product! It makes it very convenient for people like me who multi task, and it links to your phones and smart home devices"
1,Great product. Great for the beach or reading at anytime anywhere
1,"The box is fast, does what was advertised. Quick and easy to connect. Alexa and the voice activated remote is a really nice feature."
1,The echo works well. I have only gotten into the beginning of issuing it and it helps me a lot
1,"I seriously wonder why it took me to get FireTV for so long. I originally had a Roku XS and then I stupidly bought a Roku 4. Both devices were all right but neither could handle 5.1 audio from Netflix on my Vizio sound bar (essentially your device must be cable of handling Dolby Digital Plus and nothing less using Roku). I finally decided to give FireTV a try and I'm amazed. Not only does it convert DD+ to DD on Netflix and HBO Go, I can install XBMC (Kodi) on it! I wish I knew about this before I bought my Roku 4 and HTPC. I now literally have no use for my HTPC anymore... FireTV can handle EVERYTHING now and all with DD and DTS 5.1 audio. Even better, I have a ton of smart devices and 3 Echos... I can now control all of these devices directly from the remote. This is seriously one of the best purchases I have made in the past year."
1,"Amazon Fire TV is good overall, needs little more options like casting from phone and laptop and need to improve little bug in software to get better interaction and performance."
1,Best product ever my kids love them dearly!!!!!!!!
1,This is something I bought for a gift. They wanted this and as of now she loves it. I am considering buying one for myself
1,If your a amazon member get this you'll not regret it.
1,I love this tablet. It does a lot more then my previous one which cost almost 4 times the price.
1,Very convenient
0,"The first time I buy my first tablet it came on but it only showed that it needed to reeboot, it then shut off by its self."
1,"I'm no computer expert, so I appreciate how easy it is to use this tablet. Perfect for facebook, email, and online searches. It's fast and uncomplicated."
1,Great product for the price easy to use can download games for the kids to use as well
0,"It is ok to be a ""android"" tablet with such a low price. But the display is not good as they described.It hurts my eyes after long use."
1,"it can answer very easy questions, but anything more advanced it does not understand. You have to be very specific, for example you can ask whats in a martini, but you cant ask how do I make a martini. Its got room for improvement."
1,"Picked this up on the black Friday ad. $13 and it's one of the best readers I have in the house. I've got nook, iPad and Android devices which don't operate as good as this reader. But it only serves that purpose in my house."
1,I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
1,I've bought 4 of these items on different occasions as gift's. Everyone I bought it for LOVED it. Thinking of getting one for myself
1,"I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!"
1,The screen on this tablet is very nice- good picture.
1,I've previously owned a Nook and Ipad. This eReader is by far the best. The instant dictionary is a plus. Excellent for reading in bright or low light conditions. Easy out of the box set up. No complaints!
1,I absolutely love my Kindle...especially this newer generation! Great product!
1,I purchased this table for my 75 year old mom and she was able to navigate with little assistance.
1,I purchased the Fire Tablet for my father's 75th birthday. He loves using it to check his email and to play games. It's a perfect size to travel with too.
1,Purchased product to stream and it appears to be working well.
1,"Great e-book reader, soft on the eyes with no glare. will not buy any more paperbacks."
1,This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
1,My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
1,Pleasant to read at night while everyone sleeps. Great for use outside and inside. Like reading a book without losing my page
1,This kindle fire does everything you need a tablet to do. Great picture and fast processing.
1,"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
1,I brought one of these tables as a gift and they love it! It was easy to set up and great price.
1,"Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school"
1,So far I love Alexa I have orders stuff threw it.I can control my smart home from it. Set my alarms to wake me and water my lawn.Also does voice calls now.
1,Great product for night reading! Light and friendly.
1,Amazon Fire TV is the best box for watching whatever is available. Easy to set up and up to 4k viewing is available.
1,Very easy to use. Good to use at parties and entertainment.
1,this is the second paperwhite we've purchased and they are great especially for people who read in bed while others are trying to sleep!
1,Love this tablet have had several others but this brand works everytime..very happy with my purchase
1,"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
1,We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
1,I bought this tablet as a 13th birthday present for my niece. She loves it and takes it everywhere. She reads books and watches Netflix just to name a few things you can do with this tablet.
1,"I purchased it because my friends utilize a program that allows me to stream everything for free on the Firestick. I wanted to see if the connection would be better and so far it has been awesome. I also had him install a lot of old games like Mario Kart, Donkey Kong, Centierpede & overall I'm just happy with my purchase."
0,Had to spend 2 hours on line to make it work on line.
1,"Tablets are easy for setting up, & using. Thank you."
1,"For some reason I thought seven inches was a lot bigger, probably because I'm a man."
1,Great to read in the dark!! Purchased this and haven't regretted it since!!
1,Can't beat price wish the cases would fit from last one screen smaller but for the price I think gret .

1,A great tablet for the price--really no major complaints!
1,Easy to use and a lot of features. Perfect size screen.
1,Love the sound quality and ease of use and setup. It's very informative and helpful
1,This item is fantastic. Nice sound. Lots of things to use it for
0,"You cannot beat the price on this tablet, but there is no bluetooth. Also, it really hits you hard with advertising and trying to get you to do everything through amazon. We bought it to use in the kitchen with our digital cookbooks."
1,got this for my mom cause her other one died. Found out that these were only $50 which was a really good price from what she needed. The screen was a lot bigger than her last one and the screen was a whole lot sharper as well. If youre looking to give a basic tablet to someone who doesnt need to do anything business like or school related then this is the tablet you should get.
1,My granddaughter enjoy being able to download her games and music and it's real easy for her being 8 years pld.
1,It's a great tablet for everyone I would recommend.
1,"My niece is using this for her college, great for kids use in college, very versatile."
0,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
1,Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.
1,Echo does as it says. I haven't gotten into all that it can do but happy so far.
1,The Voyage is worth the extra money. It's a wonderful device. Very responsive and easy to use. I would highly recommend!
1,The kids love them! I purchased some tablets the year before off Amazon and they were cheap and broke quick I spent the same on these this last Christmas and they seem sturdier and better picture quality!
1,"I used to have the Amazon stick which I thought was good until I got my hands on the Amazon TV,Faster processor = less bufferingGreat picture qualityEndless choices for programmingIf you don't have one go get one you won't regret.Best Buy customer service in Signal Hill Ca 5 stars"
1,"Super easy to setup, I would even say you can cut cable tv if you put kodi on it. I have several thought the house and it never seems to be slow."
1,She loves reading books on it and it is very easy on the eyes
1,I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
1,"I don't use it myself, but it's my wife's favorite kindle ever. She loves the backlight. Easy on the eyes, but easy in the dark."
1,this is my second kindle fire I bought one of the first ones 6 years ago and when it started going down hill I didn't hesitate to go buy another one they last a very long time and work great. This time when I bought one it was much cheaper too but only in price not quality.
1,"Hard to beat for the price. Great for browsing, movies, web."
1,Best small tablet for the money. Good resolution for a small tablet. Does everything I expected and more.
1,Best thing to happen to my life !!! And got it cheaper being in the Best Buy program.
1,"I think the kindle is the best value for the money, this is my third. Each model gets better than the last, I'm loving my 10.1. Comfortable to use does everything I need and beautiful video."
1,This kindle is much better than the original version. The back light makes it easy to reader in low light.
1,"My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this ""big game"" as he calls it."
1,"Like the function as a Prime member - easy access to prime movies, books, etc.Its a tad slow - and every time you turn it on or unlock theres an Ad. Oh well"
1,The benefits of having the kindle fire with expandable memory has been a blessing. Everyone in my family uses the prime benefits and having a kindle for exclusive use is awesome! The benefit of adding memory is way better than the newer version with limited memory of 8 or 16G.
1,"I tend to read at night before bed and the paperwhite allows me to do that without over simulating me, allowing my eyes to slowly tire and fall asleep."
1,Great Device and Great Value for the price that is paid. Perfect for reading ebooks and general internet activity.
1,"The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application."
1,"Easy to use... I bought this tablet for my mother-in-law and she could use, without problems."
1,Great tablet for my kiddos they love these kindle fire kid tablets and they are very strong hold up to a lot. Price is great too.

1,the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great
1,I bought this item for my granddaughter she is twelve years old and very tough on electronic devices she has dropped an misplaced electronic items before so for the price I was very satisfied
1,I purchased the Amazon Tap when it was on sale for around $80. The sound is amazing (unlike my Amazon Echo it has stereo speakers!) and the battery life is great! It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device. Highly recommended!
1,Mostly use to listen to music and checking the weather.
1,The Paperwhite is so much easier to use than the classic Kindle. The Back light & touch screen are definitely worth the upgrade.
1,got it for my son to replace his old one and for the kids free time app good so far
1,I Finally decided to buy the Echo. Went to BB 10 days before Christmas and bought the last one on the shelf. Set up was a breeze and Alexa works great and not to mention I bought it on sale.
1,It took a couple days to learn to do small things on the echo. After going online and looking up various questions I'm really beginning to enjoy it. I like it so much I bought one for my son. Looking forward to learning and using it more. Just wish more information came with it as far as using it.
0,Tablet works wells for easy reading. It is also very lightweight.
1,I used to stream just about everything I watch. Beats paying a large cable bill.
1,"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
1,I use it mainly for sling but I do so much more with it and I love the remote that I can speak to Alexa
1,"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
1,"This little bad boy totally enables us to live our cord cutter dreams. Full of sweet apps that make you think twice about anything you thought you'd miss from real TV. Canceled my cable, onward to the future or bust!"
1,Bought this as a gift. My kids and I have these at home and love them. My cousin loves it as much as we do.
1,I like it. I use mostly for music.
1,i am so pleased with my fire tv ! Very easy to operate!
1,I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
1,"Easy setup. Works great.Music, news, sports.InformationTimers Alarms"
1,"I was looking for a tablet that will function well for basic web browsing and video playback as a gift for my mom. I initially purchased a Best Buy exclusive tablet that had a slightly larger screen and more memory than this Fire tablet, but it wouldn't comnect to wifi at all and took forever to load to home screen when powering on. Returned it and got this Fire and am so pleased. It does what I want it to do, although we don't use the Amazon extras lol. I just wish the screen size was a bit larger. This connects to wifi well. It does have a couple dead pixels that is really only noticeable when it displays what should be an entirely black image, but does not deter from our enjoyment of this product."
1,"This e reader is perfect! It is user friendly, holds a charge for couple days which is oerfect. The size is very compact I carry with me everywhere!"
1,"Good, inexpensive tablet that covers all the basics"
1,"Love it! I can't wait to get my entire house in SmartMode, I just love Alexa and I love listening to all the old music that she has for me to listen to you"
1,I bought this for my mom because she was having surgery and could not get to desktop. She loves it for what it is designed to do. It not an iPad but does what it's designed to do b
0,Not a bad product and for the price it makes a decent gift.
1,great results with this product. it is easy to use and exactly what I expected it to be.
1,Awesome fantastic super duper perfecto magnificent great
1,Great-----------------------------------------------
1,Really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service .....great
1,i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with
1,Purchased this for my mother in law who loves to read but can't always get to the library. It was easy for her to download books with simple instructions. Now she is hooked on some games. Best gift ever!
0,Any one who doesn't want to spend too much money and get a tablet for kids it is perfect for them.
1,The device is very useful and entertaining but if you doesn't interact with the Internet like Siri.What you see in the commercial is what you get.
1,"Extremely easy to setup. Good screen quality, good battery life. Extremely pleased."
1,"I got this to replace a Sony reader--can't get books for it anymore. That's all I really wanted it for, but I have played around with it to go on-line or check e-mail. Pretty easy to use (but it comes with next to NO instructions). If anything, it comes preloaded with too much stuff. But they are all freebies, so I don't care. I like being able to adjust the type face size, turning the page with a flick of my finger and always coming back to where I am in my book if I put the system to sleep. It has a back lit screen, so I can read in bed or in the dark even without disturbing my husband. I'm very happy with it."
1,Bought this because a family member was reading on an iPhone and wanted a bigger screen. Works well and is a fun tablet for the price!
1,"I have it integrated with the Philips Hue, and it only works about half of the time. The app is pretty weak, and really painful to try and play Audible books from. That said, I'm getting another one for upstairs, because it is insanely handy to be able to add items to shopping lists, todo lists, and do timers from anywhere in the house."
1,"Gave this as a gift. The receiver loved it and uses it all the time. I personally have an older Kindle, and I was jealous of the updates and find it to be much more like a tablet than the older Kindle Fires."
1,I slept on this item. Now that I have a Nest thermostat it is my new best friend.
1,I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's
1,My daughter loves this thing move than us she lives in it!
1,"Works as intended. Great inexpensive reader very convenient for reading at home or traveling when don't have the extra space for books. The kids & I both use it and I can separate our books so they're not mixed together.The only downside is the lack of color, but I knew this going in - it's not the fault of the product.We lose out a little bit by not being able to see the color illustrations and book covers. When getting my kids to read, the colorful covers is often what draws them in."
1,Great device very functional love it will recommend
1,this was such a super deal i bought 2. they work very well and you could not beat the price. i would definately recommend to a friend
1,Got this for my in-laws who are not tech-savvy and they are truely enjoying the ease of use.
1,"The idea behind this is great, but the technology might not be there yet. I've had some issues with dialog from TV shows setting it off."
1,This device has made me wonder why I didn't cut the cord years ago.
1,This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
1,"I used visa checkout for this kindle, so it's a bargain. Also, the product is amazing."
1,I love amazon fire tablets so I bought a tablet for each kid and they love it. You can't beat the price will differently buy more later on.
1,"Amazon fire tv has faster processor and more memory than firestick which makes the guide and navigation much faster, have sling tv app installed and scrolling through menus etc is really fast. Would recommend this to other people considering amazon firestick to choose this instead."
1,Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
1,"Once the drop in feature came around I knew it was time to get an echo for most rooms of the house. They serve as an intercom, and we can listen to music and ask questions. It's great."
1,Purchased the Amazon fire tv when it went on sale for 85 bucks and i am very happy with this purchase. This will surely replace cable tv in the not so distant future.
1,My 4 year old loves it. I love that she can use it unsupervised without worry. She has been learning her alphabet and this has been a great tool.
1,Purchased my first Echo and love it. It seems 'smarter' than other AI systems. Even my wife enjoys Alexa.
1,"My kid loves her new ""phone"" as she calls it. Clear picture and it is fast as well. Great item for the money!"
1,Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
1,"The purchase was primarily for my husband who is technology-challenged. He can now listen to the music he wants, when he wants. He is still experimenting with asking questions. You do have to be careful when talking about Alexa, because she will respond to your conversation."
1,got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now
1,Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
1,I highly recommend the firestick to any user. Great for any age
1,"I am a gadget guy and a big fan of tablets and e-ink readers. They each have their specialties and purposes, and e-readers are still best for reading. I have bitten a kindle supporter from the beginning, this latest model only further improves on that reputation.The back lighting is awesome and the touch screen is amazing. The clarity and definition is outstanding. I was do excited waiting for this to be released and was very pleased with the results!"
1,The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again
1,I would recommend this device for any child in school
1,Love that tablets bought the tablets for friend that love it
1,I purchased this as a gift and the child loves it!
1,"You really can't get much better bang for your buck! Great Device, a must have"
1,Good tablet for the money. Would purchase again. Very fast
1,I was looking for a basic tablet for normal use - games and music - and this tablet answered my need and to top it up fit my budget as well. I bought this during the thanks-giving season this year and is worth the price I shelled out. Bestbuy as usual shipped it in time and free shipping was just an icing on the cake :-). Would recommend this to anyone.
1,"I bought three and everyone loved it. It was a pain in the neck to set up with the wifi more than a handful of times. I had to look up in the net and resolve the issue. I learned, I needed to change the password for it. On occasion wifi needs to be rebooted. But, all in all, when is not having issues connecting, it is a wonderful product! You just have to be patient at times."
1,We listen to Echo every day! Great Amazon music. All types of music. Working on it turning my lights on and off.
1,"Bought for a gift, very good for a young child easy to operate"
0,Great Servive Best Buy and the price match is great I used it both at best buy
1,This is really cool. 100's of uses. Works flawlessly!!!
1,Love this gadget. Great product. Easy to set up. Sound is incredible.
1,I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
1,Love the larger screen and picture clarity. It is very easy to use.
1,I plugged it in and helps tremendously with the kids homework as well as let me change the light in my house hands free. Also has a great speaker so I can hear it clearly across the room
1,It is best for kids without any cell phone!!Great features!!
1,Easy to set up. Durable for toddlers. Highly recommend.
1,Love it every one should have one easy to use but need other parts to set this up to lights in your home
1,Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
1,I bought it for my son and it keep him going. I love it.
1,My girlfriend and I purchased this for her nephew and he absolutely loves it. He is able to play his games on it and his Mom is able to read books to him before bed. Great product for any age.
1,Awesome product and works pretty much as expected especially with my amazon echo and google home
1,highly recommend. we have both the google device and this one. both sre great. Alexa is mire versatile. Kids love it too.
1,"I bought 2 of these. I didn't want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars."
1,We bought this for our daughter so she has tablet she can read on that lasts a long time on one charge and doesn't play video games.
1,Amazon Echo is the bee's knees. You can talk to it and stuff and it talks back and does stuff for you. I use it mostly for playing music and making grocery lists.
1,Purchased for my 9 yr old nephew for his birthday. He had been asking for a tablet forever. I made his day! He loves his tablet. All he's does is watch you tube and play games
1,"Had glitches and screen-touch sensitivity issues with the previous kindle ( the basic kindle) however, this is definitely worth the cost for an upgrade above it. Very user friendly and hassle free."
1,"Easy setup, nice OS, no issues whatsoever, voice recognition in the remote is sweet and works well."
1,This device works well and however there is no clear way to tell what programming is free with subscription or what requires a fee.
1,I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.
1,Easy to use and great for listening to the music you want to hear.
1,It has good graphics quality and it is easy to use. Only complaint is when using the built in keyboard it doesn't always register they right keys.
1,Purchased as a gift for the wife. She enjoys it immensely
1,This thing is cool! Paired with smart switches helps my mom turn her lights on and off without getting up.
1,"I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
1,I like the amazon firetv more than the firestick...
1,I really enjoy this product. It's great with streaming pretty much everything.
1,Love the echo for everything from music to weather
1,Works great! I like it better than cable. My new favorite device to watch movies and tv shows. My kids like the games that are available.
1,"i bought 2 as gifts, but i had a chance to use one of them, and it is great, probably as good if not better than apple tv, and I currently have an apple tv in my house. The music app alone is worth the price. And the set up was very easy. I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom. It does not come with he HDMI cable, and that would be an extra $15, maybe cheaper depending where and the length you get, but it is still cheaper than an apple TV."
1,"I wanted a tablet for my son to play games and read books. I didn't want to spend hundreds because he is only 8. This is perfect, I can put controls on what he views and password protect my control profile."
1,Nice quick charge gives full power level. I like how it is labeled amazon so I can clearly identify it and not be confused by other chargers!
1,Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.
1,this is another gift for a friend who enjoyed very much.
1,The Amazon fire TV device is incredibly fast very cost-effective and super reliable. Great for gaming movies television and a lot more. I love it! Buy it now.
1,"Small and lightweight. Easy to use! I can read, search the web or check in on social media on this device."
1,We love it no need for cable! Just make sure you have really good internet!
1,Fast shipping and great product Would recommend to friends
1,The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
0,"This cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the Kindle. The metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the Kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my Kindle.I understand this new Kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover. I hope that over time, again, about a year plus it won't crack the frame in the same place again on my new Kindle.I am so thankful that Amazon replace both my Kindle and the book cover as a result of this problem.I would recomend that after about 6 months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your Kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact Amazon before the frame of your Kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your Kindle."
1,Bought this on a flash sale 64.99!! This is great especially when running the playstation vue app streaming!
1,If you want to cut the cable and go from your cable plan to a much more common sense one utilize this magical little box. Not only can it be loaded up with the standard TV apps it also makes a pretty great gaming system.
1,This is high quality stuff. I recommend it to everyone.
1,I held off for quite some time on buying this product being it seemed awful expensive for a tablet with only one purpose. I can now say Im glad I bought it. No more having to worry about reading on a bright sunny day and just in general seems much easier on the eyes.
1,Bought think would not use much lets try it out. We have used it everyday
1,So much better than the original one I had. I would definitely buy another one.
1,My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.
1,Great tablet Very good put together and easy to use Greatest for gaming
1,Great tablet Easy for a child to use Price is right and size
1,Easy on the eyes. Smaller and even better than earlier versions
1,I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I read it every night before I go to bed.If you love to read before bed - I highly recommend the Paperwhite vs. the other Kindles - the others are like computer screens - and it is very stimulating to your brain... this is just like reading paper - except you don't need a light on in the room because it's back lit - but you can adjust the light from fairly bright to very low. Battery lasts 10 to 15 days depending on how much I read.
1,"does so much at a voice command. music, news, weather, answers questions, but becareful. it doesn't distinguish voices, so someone could buy something and charge it to your prime or credit account"
1,"I was looking to bu an affordable tablet but with all the necessary features and this tablet is great. Good touch, display and speed. Very happy to buy this but would have been happier if I would have got some discount."
0,It's ok I would recommend it to friends for sure in the future
1,Kids love it. Does the job of an iPad but cost way less
1,This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
1,"I purchased this Kindle Fire 7 on sale. It was a no brainer. It is faster than my 2012 Fire HD 7 thought the screen resolution cannot compare to the 2012 Fire HD 7. Screen resolution is adequate and for my use as an every day ereader, web browser, email it is perfect. I haven't used the cameras so cannot comment. I tested them out and they seem OK."
1,"I bought the Amazon Firebox so I could finally get rid of cable. when I think of all the $$ I will save on cable I may buy another one for 2nd tv. A bit challenging learning how to operate it, Once I do I know I will love it. Thanks Amazon"
1,This was very easy to order online and pickup. Convenient and hastle free.
1,"Great product, small and barely noticeable on top of my DVD player."
1,Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
1,Works really well ! My kids love it and it's so easy to use !
1,Definitely an excellent kindle for the price. Cant beat it.
1,"It tells me news, weather and can listen to prime music."
1,If you have an amazon prime account this is the item for you!
1,Easy to set up and simple price is good cant complaint
1,"I wish you could keep DVR longer, but otherwise good."
0,"Works okay for what we paid. Not super speedy, quality is a little grainy as well"
1,"Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions."
1,The ease of the touch screen makes for easy use with arthritis old granny nurse
1,Great steelbook for a great movie. this steelbook is amazing
1,Very satisfied with it as wellbas the serv8ce received form sale person
1,"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
1,"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
1,Love my Alexia. I'm learning more and more everyday
1,"Haven't used it much, but so far I like it! Mostly use to play games on."
1,"My oldest loves it, the charger doesn't last long."
1,The size is just what I needed for my outdoors kit. I plan on using it mostly for reading. It fits in my pocket
1,"A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price."
1,"The product is very light, making it easy to read."
0,"This reader is purely for the person that simply wants an e-book reader, and very little else."
1,it was the first time that i purchased something like this and it was a gift so i asked and she loved it.
1,Excellent screen. Very easy to read. Easy to navigate. Love it.
1,What a value and so useful. We enjoy all that the Echo can do. The sound is excellent..........and it's so easy to set up and use.Thank you best buy
1,"Alexa will tell you the weather immediately. In addition, music, of your liking, is available in seconds. Your voice command even controls the decibel level."
0,Don't support google.. My son could not view his grade.
1,Great streaming device and it's a bit faster than the fire stick. Great buy.
1,"purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!"
1,"I love having this item in the house. It makes life easier when walking into a room with a hands full of a laundry basket or groceries, etc"
1,Alexa is like my personal assistant. She does it all! And keeps me company when I'm bored. Still learning new features but this is the coolest thing I've bought for myself in a long time!
1,"This tablet, although small, can pack a huge punch. It holds charge really well. The graphics are very high quality and there are so many amazon apps for the whole family to use. Love it. I use it all the time. Definately a great buy if on a budget."
1,Bought this for a Christmas gift for my mom I thinks she will like it
1,Works great for all of those little quick questions and even better if you are getting into Home Automation
1,"Love that this now has a sd slot. Its amazing to watch movies that we downloaded, read books. Its a little slow but for the price its amazing. Great speakers and picture"
1,"Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better."
1,Easy to use and set up! Package and arrival as great through Best Buy!
0,"Since this is an Android 5 based tablet, I sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an Android tablet, with Google play store, etc. The screen resolution, speaker, RAM are just only adequate. Otherwise, a good cheap tablet. Really need to ponder its utility before buying it."
1,"Would be better if you could use the Google play store, still haven t figured out how to download yet"
1,Bought Echo as gift for my (senior) dad. It's terrific & entertaining. A little difficult to install/ set up. The sound quality & voice recognition are amazing.
1,"I absolutely love the Echo! I tell Alexa what kind of music to play and she plays it. Great as a timer in the kitchen, controls my Nest, answers random questions you may have and even tells jokes! I plan on buying more ""smart home"" devices to get even more use from it."
1,"Alexia was a great Christmas gift for my daughter. It does take a lot of experimentation to get Alexia to do specific tasks. Other tasks like time, weather, set an alarm are no more than basic voice commands. Would definitely recommend this product."
1,"FireTV with the option for 4K opens the possibility to a new world. Not to mention that the android based software opens the door to use apps beyond the amazon store. if you have a prime account, your experience is greatly enhance. Good wireless connection another plus."
1,Firestick was laggy so i upgraded to the fire tv. Smooth and better then the firestick. Should have bought the fire stick instead of the firetv.
1,I bought it for work and play and it is working out great for both.
1,"would buy again , amazing product would buy again best has great service"
1,My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.
1,the tablet is great for kids. it's ok if it gets damaged because the are so cheap compared to an ipad. easier to just got get at BB
1,This is just as good for many of the everyday type stuff as the ipad but at a fraction of the price. The only thing that I would change is making the volume louder.
1,Awesome ereader for anyone looking for convince of paperless books. The ability to adjust the backlight is awesome!
1,gave as a gift along with the cover. person seemed to like it
1,Love my kindle. It's perfect to take with me on the go. Very easy to use.
1,Easy to use and lots of fun and very lite weight ..
1,"Tried the Firestick but was unhappy with processor and streaming quality. The Fire TV solved those problems. I like using Alexa, wish she could see content in PlayStation Vue app but otherwise this works great"
1,This tablet has pretty good resolution for reading and runs smooth on basic games
1,I picked this tablet for my sister It was reasonably priced and simple to use. She is really enjoying seeing her children and grandchildren's pics.
1,"This thing is great very quick streaming and no issues so far, love the voice controller on finding shows or movies."
1,"If you are looking for big banks for your bucks with an Android tablet, you can rarely go wrong with the Amazon Fire tablet. And if you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, you definitely should have this tablet."
1,"Quite simple: it's a kindle fire tablet. It does exactly what it should do as a tablet attached to a reader. I like that I can send things from my desktop to my kindle. It streams well, and it works well with my Bluetooth keyboard. This is actually what convinced me to do a year of Prime. Next year we'll see how it goes if I renew, but so far so good. The lock screen shows a different advert, but that's not so bad...it's only a lock screen."
1,Wanted a reader that I could just get and go on my way. Always have something to read. Apps are great. Easy for my 7 yr old grandson to enjoy too.
1,Got this tablet for a great price. Works well and has a fast processor.
1,Very reponsive processor high quality display expandable storage up to 128gb via sd card lots of free apps via amazon app store decent battery life and inexpensive price what more can you ask for!!!
1,Replaced an old blue ray cd player. Less space used and very fast response time.
1,I bought this for my daughter who uses it in her AP classes...easier to use a bigger screen than her phone screen in class. She loves it!Price was great!
1,Bought these for my boys and they love them! Tons of features and battery to keep the boys playing!
0,"I love this device for my kids who are way too young to trust with a $500 tablet such as an iPad. Works efficiently, my kids love it, & I love the parental control features. If something happens to it, amazon handles it quickly & if it were to break or get lost, it's cheap to replace. That being said, it obviously doesn't hold a candle to Samsung or apple's tablets. I'm not really a fan of the operating system."
1,"This tablet is much faster coming up to the start position than any other that I have had!So, I bought another one."
1,"We were hesitant to buy an electronic reader, but started to accumulate so many books we ran out of space to store or give away.So happy to have the KINDLE and can share on iPad so often we are reading and discussing the same book! Love it!"
1,This came with the Kindle Paperwhite I bought as a birthday present for the love of my life. See that review.
1,Meets the needs. very well designed and a good place to start for reading ebooks and watching online shows on the go.
1,"With an HD antenna and Fire TV, we said goodbye to the cable company. Everything you want to watch for a fraction of the price."
1,This is a budget tablet that I purchased during Black Friday and for the price it can't be beat I use it strictly for music and don't have any problems. Excellent for kids doesn't cost much and if they break it you didn't invest much.
1,"Absolutely can't get enough of my fire TV. Best purchase of 2017!! I highly recommend fire TV to anyone who doesn't want to pay a cable bill anymore. Hulu, Netflix, HBO is all u need and at about 1/10 the cost of cable, I love it!! Don't forget Kodi *wink*"
1,We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
1,Easy device for my in-laws who are not tech savvy.
1,I got this for myself. The price on this is amazing for what you get. Yes I would of liked to get an iPad because I'm very used to Apple an I have a iPhone but the price difference between these it pretty much a no brainier for me.
1,Love the new white kindle with the built-in backlight for reading in the dark.
1,"I bought this for my dad. He had my sister's original Kindle Fire and it died. So for Father's Day, I bought him a new one. He loves it. He loves that it is a tablet and a Kindle in one great bundle!!"
1,Removed from the box and put the device immediately into operation.
1,Does the job it’s suppsed to. Get it and enjoy life in the fast lane
1,Echo works well with a variety of different devices that have different protocols. It's an easy start to home automation.
1,Simple set up. Range of activities make for something new each interaction.
1,Perfect tablet for younger kids. It is inexpensive so when they inevitably break it you will not be so mad.
1,Works well in sunlight I love it! No pesky ads love it
1,"I bought 3 of these tablets. One for my dad, son and grandson and they all love it! My dad who is 76 years old and not computer lit at all said it is ""pretty easy"" to use (after it was set up by my son for him)."
1,This is a great Kindle. It has great sound and clarity of the screen. Easy to use.
1,It is a Great product and it was all I expected in this product.
1,"The main deciding factor as to why I got this device as opposed to the stick was that I gave me the option to either use WiFi or to use an ethernet cord. So far I can say I've been happy, the apps are vast enough to find what i want in regards to entertainment and the navigation isn't to complicated."
1,I bought it as a Christmas gift and the person enjoys it.
1,I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel.
1,"After breaking an iPad, this was a perfect cheaper alternative for my toddler."
0,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.
1,"I own three Amazon Echos: one at home and one each at 2 vacation homes. I use them mostly for grocery and to-do lists, weather, and music. We have also given four as gifts."
0,"The recharging port is not working consistently. I have tried other cables, so I know it's not the cable. Otherwise it works fine. I am looking forward to not having to charge it but once a week."
1,"Although the price is high, it is worth and useful."
0,Love the ease of using them for our grandsons and they enjoyed them for Christmas
1,"Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version"
1,"Great performance, prefer over the fire stick for the larger storage capacity, and processing speed. Also has the ability to be hard wired if wireless signal is too weak. Only drawback is the wires that run to-from the box."
1,Grand kids love it and it picked up the network in short order. They like the idea they have an iPad like the adults. Well implemented.
1,Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There's ways to switch it to kid friendly
1,use it for taking pictures of family for memories.
1,These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.
1,Love my Amazon Fire Tablet!! Perfect size to carry in purse
1,Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.
1,I got this for my 2 year old nephew he loves it and it is pretty quick the one down side is that Amazon charges you $15 if you want to remove the adds that are in the lock screen but besides that the device is perfect for him to play games and watch movies
1,"I like the fact that I don't have to carry books anymore, just this little device and I have a lot of books in hand."
1,I bought this for my grandson for his 5 Th birthday present . It is easy to set up and seems to be very durable.
1,"Love the Echo speaker! Great sound! However, you must be an Amazon prime subscriber to enjoy the full benefits of this product."
1,I got this for my one and two year old girls and I don't have any complaints! The battery life isn't great but I don't really mind that!
1,very easy to use

0,I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`
1,I like the tablet because it is a good size and east for a three year old to use.
1,"My 1st generation Kindle broke and I decided to replace it. The back light was the one thing missing from my first Kindle. The back light, long battery life, lightweight and ability to store 1000s of books made this an excellent choice for me. I almost never leave home without it."
1,I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase!
1,Purchase this kindle fo your child and they will LOVE you! Seriously!
1,"Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc"
1,"I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter, had some issues with the charging cable. Took it in and Best Buy replaced it because I bought the 2 year replacement product. Its nice because I can use a card and she can download whatever games she wants"
1,My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!
1,Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
1,This little Kindle was worth the money for sure. I would tell all my friends to buy this because of the great price that it is.
1,"A great tablet for a good price, it has the basics, works great for a child preferably."
0,Average tablet for general use. I still like Apple better!
1,Love it. Very happy with purchase. Does everything I expected .

1,High resolution screen with very clear and vibrant color representation.
1,Very cheap tablet that is relatively powerful. Makes good bathroom tablet.

1,This amazon Kindle Fire is of God quality. It's a lot faster than the one I had before
0,Good to have for your at home entertainment. It has every app known to man.
1,Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a tablet.
1,So many improvements over previous models. Love the new page turn feature.
1,"Able to read more and longer than I thought. Light is bright enough, but too bright to bother someone nearby."
0,the concept is great! We have had some issues with certain streams being unplayable and it is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. There needs to be an easier way to maneuver and find the things you want to watch.
1,Love the warranty that comes with this! It makes it very conducive for kids to use!
1,"I picked up the tablet Black Friday, intending it as a gift for my daughter. I knew beforehand that it had a crippled Android OS. I also knew that it wouldn't be top of the line for the price paid. However, for a sub hundred dollar tablet it is pretty good... After a little tweaking ( custom ROM with a few kernel adjustments)"
1,I saw that Best Buy had a great deal on this and I was looking for a smaller sized tablet for all the Kindle books I have bought or ordered. The item shipped pretty quickly and I did have issues setting it up but once I got through that I fell in love. I quickly downloaded my books to the Kindle and surfed online with ease. This was a great deal!
1,"I love it so far, no problems, easy setup and lots of skills to add on. Plan on using it extensively with home automation."
1,Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.
1,This was bought for a first time user of any type of computer/tablet. He found it very easy to work with and enjoys it very much
1,Was used as a gift. Receiver said was delighted and would begin using immediately.
1,Bought for my youngest daughter. She loves it. Will buy again.
1,Works great. We own two of them and love to watch our shows when/where we want.
1,Cool item for a great price! Purchased when on sale so was like $39.99! Great little tablet!
1,"Really good and solid tablet, especially for kids. Highly recommend that you buy the case that goes with it too."
1,It's a good device for kids and first time smart device users. Easy interface without breaking the bank.
1,"Love this reader. Small, light, easy to read in bright sunlight. Seems solid and durable."
1,"Awesome steaming device, compared to the Roku 3 I would give the Amazon Fire TV the edge. Great buy, I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about cutting the cord on their cable subscription."
1,Bought it for my 4 yr old nephew who loves it. Easy to use.
1,I want to get more automated items to hook up with alexa
1,I would recommend this to anyone that loves watching movies.
1,Very pleased and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this item.
1,Great price and value. Fast processing. Many games and user options available.
1,Bought two for my kids they love them. Great for the price.
1,"I've had the old kindle 7, but love this one more. It's a little smaller so it's easier to hold while using it. Great for playing on apps, checking stuff online, and reading books. Easy to travel which I love"
1,Now that playstation vue went nationwide I wanted something something for live tv to replace my ps3. I am now able to watch cable tv and ota(through an hdhomerrun) with no rental fees. The picture quality is great and has a great app selection.
1,Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay.
1,"I was streaming with my Sony Blu-Ray, and only bought this to access HBO Now, but it's turned out to have much more than just that to offer. It's really a fantastic piece of equipment. The Sony has a great number of streaming apps, but the Fire TV has much more, and lots of things I really missed, such as PBS and PBS Kids, as well as access to Amazon's music streaming. I'm very happy that I bought this."
1,"Product works like it should, not a fan of the adds when you start up."
1,"Even if your home sin't hooked up with all the technology to go with it, it will still be the best speaker you ever bought. And if you have amazon prime, you can hook her up to it! Love it, but be careful! cause once you get it,you probably won't be able to go back to other wireless speakers again!"
1,My husband is enjoying this tablet for reading and netflix.
1,Would like to be able to delete items to make room for more things I do want but otherwise I enjoy it very much. Easy to take anywhere
1,"It is easy to set up and start using. The Amazon Echo has an incredible wealth of programs at your disposal. But there are limitations. Once you understand the limitations, you can enjoy a world of music and entertainment at your fingertips. Just realize that it does not have access to every song by every singer. And understand that you have to work with Alexa's interpretation of your accent and pronunciations. Enjoy."
1,I'm normally an Apple snob but needed a cheap tablet and was very surprised how functional the Amazon Fire is.
1,Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
1,This device is very responsive and couples very well with an Amazon Membership.
0,Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
1,A great little tablet for the price. Works well. A gift for my wife to read e-books on but surfs the Internet nicely too.
1,This is a great tablet for the price. The Amazon OS is a bit sluggish but this is great for kids or to just keep laying around the house.
1,Already had one and I love it so I purchased another one.
0,I bought 3 of them as gifts for my nephews. It was really disapproval to learn that they were already linked to my Amazon account. I started getting notices everything's they downloaded something. I had to literally unlink everyone one of them from my account before they made a big purchase (which they did purchase Amazon Prime-which I cancelled because I wasn't ready for a $100 purchase).
1,He loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and I see no signs of damage whatsoever
1,i love the speaker sound and that I can talk to Alexa and ask her anything.
1,"Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
1,I found this tablet to be very easy to use and really liked the dual camera it has
1,I bought this for my aunt to play games and be able to use Facebook. She loves how easy it was to setup and use.
1,I like the way parents control what thier child and what programs they see or use

1,Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
1,i love this amazon fire tv box and best buy had the lowest price and they have the best customer service
1,very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
1,"We love Alexa and our Echo. If we need an answer, all we have to do is ask Alexa."
1,"We love this. Alexa is so intelligent and our son loves her. Also you get a discount on amazon music. You can hook the echo up to tvs, lights, and more. Just tell her what you want her to do"
1,"We use it to control our Hue lights and Nest thermostat, along with music and making shopping lists. The kids use it for all kinds of goofy stuff."
1,This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
1,"I really didn't think I'd use the Echo nearly as much as I do. It's unbelievable!!! It's my go to for questions, weather, news, and the family even plays games on it !! The music is great... such big sound from such a small speaker. I need one for every room !!!"
1,"I bought this for PlayStation Vue, and I am very satisfied with it. Highly recommend!"
0,"Didn't really do it for me. Being an ipad user, this unit was really foreign. If you are familiar with Amazon Fire products, it will be great for you."
1,The kindle paper white works perfectly. The battery life is amazing!
1,This is one of the best products I use in such a long time not only you could watch live television and movies you can catch up with the shows do you like both international and domestic
1,It's my first time owing a kindle. But so happy I purchase it. All my favorite books in one place. Love the light and how practical it is.
0,"nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs."
1,My 3 youngest boys got these for Christmas and LOVE them!
1,works great and you can customize it. very nice with the voice remote
1,"easy to setup and connect to your wi-fi. Performs numerous tasks when asked including playing music from Pandora and I-Heart radio, get local or another areas local weather forecast and much more, only problem I had is that I was unable to load my I-Tunes music into Amazon music to play through Echo."
1,Fun device for the whole family. Even the jokes are funny.
1,This tablet was purchased for a present. It is the second one that I have purchased.
1,The adults and children who received the tablet as a gift have thoroughly enjoyed it.
1,Echo has been a great hit with my children as well as my self. Ordering is so simple it is saving me time.
1,"I already own the Amazon Echo, so for smart speaker, it is one of the most handy devices out there. There is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing. Since the software update that allows you to use ""Always On"" voice commands like its big brother, it has become my go to device.Pros:- Wireless Bluetooth Smart Speaker - I take it to work and use it in the car, even when I travel for work- Sync's up with my popular music aps (Spotify, Pandora, etc)- Alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly- The best Alarm Clock- I sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips- Speaker is able to get loud- Control smart devices like lighting and my ecobee - Option to turn Off/On voice commands, can use tap button instead- Very long range for voice commandsCons:- Only single band Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz- Battery life when using ""Always On"" voice commands is short- Speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other Bluetooth speakersOverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs, with only minimal cons. I use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion.Tip for BESTBUY: You should carry cases for this device as I had to get my protector elsewhere"
0,Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly
1,great little box for streaming alot of media content.
1,Very happy with this kindle. I purchased this kindle over the paperwhite due to the physical buttons.
1,"Bought this tablet for my 4 year old and also one for my father. Both are able to use this for their own purposes and are very happy. Price is good, especially since kids tend to be a bit rough with electronics. Plus for profile creation and restricting access to features from kids."
1,"Surprisingly good and useful for the price. You really can't beat a $50 tablet. But remember, it still is a budget tablet. Tip: Adding anti-glare matte screen protector will great improve user experience and your interaction between finger and screen surface. Just like other budget tablets, Kindle Fire 7 lacks that coating finish on screen surface which will cause screen to attract smudges more than tablets with that coating."
1,Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
1,great tablet for the price. excellent gift for anyone
1,We have gotten new Kindle every year grand children love them
1,The Kindle Voyager has a very easy to read screen with great resolution.
0,"Probably a fine item for most but i bought it for a specific application, the best buy employee said it would work but unfortunately it didn't."
1,"Because my granddaughter's name is Alexa, I though it would be funny to get one for a gift. I took me a few minutes to figure out how to set it up but it worked well when configured. It was funny when somebody mentioned Alexa and the Halo answered. When we had music playing somebody as a joke whispered ""Alexa volume level 10"" and then we couldn't the Halo to hear us to shut it up. I had to turn the top of the speaker to quiet it down. I made for an entertaining time. I will probably get one for myself."
1,for the price it is worth it... for below usd50.00 you get a decent tablet
1,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas present and he loves it he's on it all the time it also teaches him to read and a lot of other things he has games on it and he would be on it 24 hours a day if we would let him
1,It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
1,Gift purchase for my son and family for Christmas.
1,"We have enjoyed Alexa tremendously. We have the echo set up to turn our lights on and off, we use it as a timer and play pandora through it daily."
1,This is going to be great fun and practical also. I chose this over the Dot (a smaller version) because I wanted the best audio.
1,Echo learns as you use it. As you learn how to ask questions echo's answers get better.
1,"It is an amazing product for beggnners, high quality materIals amd fast processor"
1,Great choice for amazon prime members that want optimum flexibility and resolution
1,"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want."
1,Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app.
1,I was looking from long time and good deal found on best buy!!!
1,"This tablet serves its purpose as my primary reader and mini computer on the go. Size is good, picture is clear, and the volume isn't bad for media either. Thumbs up"
1,Works well for my purposes. Wanted a calendar and contact list so all of the other things are a bonus.
1,It worked as it should
1,Streaming services run great. Multi-Tasking is terrible though. A lot of games aren't supported. Good for browsing the web and streaming only
1,This tablet does everything the Ipad Mini can do except that it is cheaper than the Ipad.
0,I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
1,Purchased for a gift. Person receiving it loved it and is extremely happy with it.
1,This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.
1,The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.
1,"The Amazon fireTV is a good Roku replacement. It does push Prime and Amazon fee based content, but the Fire TV is smooth and has some nice features like Alexa (when you push the microphone button on the remote), free games, and voice search. Overall, it's a pretty cool product."
1,Device is very responsive upon command. Easy to setup and is a companion when no one is in the room
1,Love my tablet best one so far. It's light weight and easy to use.
1,But I don't know if it is worth the additional money. And it does not allow for aux output. I have the full size in my bathroom were I do not have other speakers. I use the dot with my sound system.
1,Works fine. Carol
1,I bought this for my son and he.loves it. He reads and plays games on it all the time.
1,"System loads slow, but otherwise is ok. Be aware that you are not buying a full tablet. It was what I was looking for!"
1,"I use this table to control all of the smart devices in my home. Its the perfect size to do so. Also has the convenience of everyone in the home having the ability to do so with out have to us ""my"" phone."
1,BROUGHT FOR MY COWORKERS DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES IT. HE SAID ITS HER BEST GIFT.
1,Best small tablet on the market hands down. Easy bright great touch screen.
1,grandson really enjoyed it Christmas. very easy to use
1,"Even though is good with music, not so good with news and general information. Google is a better deal"
1,I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!
1,The best of the streaming boxes. I have used all of the major brands and like the Fire TV the best.
1,I did away with cable and was trying to choose between a roku and firebox. Decided on the firebox and so happy I did. Works with all my other amazon products.
1,Great purchase. Great customer service. Definitely
0,"I own 3 of these kindles, for my children who are young. They can take some wear and tear, but recently one of mine quit charging. The charger will no longer connect with the port inside the kindle. The kindle itself was working just fine, but since it can no longer be charged, it is no longer functioning. I am really disappointed, and plan on buying a replacement. My children love being able to play on the kindle and for the price you really can't beat the deal."
1,Easy and fast access to all popular apps. Appreciate the voice search on the remote.
1,"Had some remodeling performed in the house. Had to move the echo to another location. After the job was finished, moved it back and just needed one in both locations."
1,I have 2 of these in my home and love them. Alexa voice commands are fun to mess with. I use these for Amazon Prime Services and Netflix mostly. This model is more than double the speed of the sticks and have 4K support. I love the expandable storage and the fact I have KODI on these bad boys makes it all the better.
1,I got a Great price for an 8g Amazon Fire tablet. It works great. It works for what I need it for.
1,"The screen resolution is quite sharp & vivid, and the battery lasts a LONG time, but I found a major drawback: In a sense, it's like being confined to an AMAZON playground... big, yes, but accessing the BIGGER outside world can be a challenge. I often get sidetracked to AMAZON-authorized playthings, and getting around them, while doable, well, they don't make it easy. The only key is stubborn persistence."
1,"Great size, easy to read at night and no glare screen."
0,Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere
1,I play a lot of music on it and it sounds so crystal clear!
1,Echo is love. Echo is life. And I have to write 50
1,I had to purchase this item to see if it was really nice like I was told.
0,"I bought this and the kids version past Christmas. Its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. Don't waste money on this product. The kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. When they do work, the kids enjoy them. So I consider it to be a hit and miss. I'll be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up. Not wasting money on it."
0,I was disappointed that she can't connect to you tube. She's otherwise great. You have to be very specific when asking her something. When I ask about news in a certain region. She just gives the general news which may have nothing about the specified region.
1,Great for reading books and not having to lug around that weight
1,I would suggest this over the fire stick and over the android tv.
1,"I must say I have always been making jokes about Amazon and their devices, but after getting the Amazon Fire 7, I must admit I have been wrong. This little device is amazing for such a low price. You honestly get a lot for your money, and I can definitely recommend it to people who want a good tablet without spending $100+ on one."
1,This tablet is great for my kids. small enough for my toddler to hold and watch movies and play her games.
1,"The Paperwhite is my second Kindle. The back lighting and the ease of operation are big enjoyments and differences from my last (old) Kindle. The smaller size took a little getting used to, but, now it seems very comfortable. Very easy to personalize as well."
1,"I really enjoy my Fire Tablet! I am able to read, watch videos, tv shows and much more! It is awesome for my little ones but it do not have youtube kids. Instead, you can pull up youtube kids on the regular part of the table, using the internet. That became a plus with my kids. I like how you can customize it to fit your child age!"
1,We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.
1,My 10 year old love's the tablet she can play her games talk to her friends on Facebook and she doesn't have to use my computer.
1,I read reviews on each Kindle device and chose the paperwhite. It fits easily in my purse. I only wanted it to read books and did not need a device for other functions.
1,Brought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.
1,The Amazon Fire TV is really easy to use and installation was super easy. I have really enjoyed the voice search feature. Best purchase I've made in awhile.
1,I have cut my cable. I would have done this before but didn't know how to get college sports. Fire with Amazon and SlingTV has bridged the gap. I receive local channels with an antennae and the fire does the rest. Saving about $75 per month.
1,Bought one for myself and then purchased two more for my grandsons. Great price.
1,Love my Echo. Set up was simple and the range of music and information available is fantastic. I would highly recommend this product.
1,"easy to use.. I am not able to access any music, I am looking forward to getting the lighting package"
1,it is great. it's a lot better than hey Siri - it understands the whole families voice without any issues
1,This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out
1,Alexa became my new best friend along side siri. I ask her anything and everything. Shes great
1,it is nice works fast and good easy to use and looks good too!!!
1,"Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."
1,Kids love being able to use this item as well! Very good for their little hands to use.
1,Purchased the Fire TV over the Fire Stick because it os capable of streaming 4K. Device works great.
1,"Very good value. Perfect for checking emails, watching videos and browsing the Internet . Only disappointment is the camera is not great quality but ok"
1,"Best kindle ever, great for readings, the charger sold separately"
1,Good for basic things or as an e-reader. My kids love theirs.
1,"Works great in my kitchen, so helpful with tasks.."
1,Very nice product. Works great with my tv. The menu is simple and the software is very responsive.
0,I gave this as a gift and so I heard it has been working very well
1,"I upgraded from the 1st gen Fire TV to get 4k. Happy I did, 4k looks fantastic through Netflix/Amazon."
1,This kindle tablet has been amazing. I am so glad with this purchase.
1,"Arrived intact, and works well to charge my little kindle."
1,This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
1,"NICE TABLET, BUT IT WANTS YOU TO PUT ALL YOUR BILLING INFORMATION IN AND A CREDIT CARD TO DO ALL PURCHASES. IS A HASSLE TO PULL UP PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THIS. GOOD FOR A CHILD."
1,Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.
1,I would highly recommend this product. Easy to set up and use. Opens the door to see shows otherwise would have been overlooked. Will buy again.
1,Depending on what your using it for this is the best bang for your buck for online TV!
1,"Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!"
1,It's absolutely perfect for my needs!! I liked it so much I bought a second one!
1,I bought this Tablet for my kids and it is Amazing. They are always on U tube!
1,This is a great little tablet for little kids or people that only wants to read novels.
1,we bought this for my 11 year old daughter and we love it. So easy to set up and use. Much better than the one made especially for kids. This one has better capabilities.
1,"We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
1,The reason I bought this model kindle was for the backlight to read at night. The internet connectivity is great too. I've been reading a Russian history book and use the dictionary and Wikipedia lookup often to look up people and places with ease.
1,"I compared it with google home. Amazon echo has a lot of effort in it already, but google home has much greater potential when they update it over the next few years. Overall echo is a very good product."
1,Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
1,This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.
1,This tablet is very great because it's not harsh on the eyes when reading and the battery life is great. I like to read a lot so it's perfect for that. The touch screen works well too. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
1,"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."
1,"great tablet for children, lots of content. games books etc and easy for my 4 y.o to use."
1,I was pleased with features of this low cost device
1,Bought my 11 year old niece and my 7 year old nephew one a piece for their Birthdays and they love it! Great Tablet for all ages and very user friendly.
0,I bought this for Christmas for my niece. She loves it. She's four years old
0,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it for it's games and learning apps. As for navigating the app store it is not as easy as apple or android. But you get use to it.
1,Better than the fire stick crystal clear perfect gift for someone
1,Did not realize how small it would be but it seems to do the job...Still learning how to use but have a free Geek Squad appointment this week to review and setup. Love that about BB.
1,At the price pout you will not find a better product!
1,Someone recommended this to us for the 3 and 4 year olds. We bought two as gifts. Best Buy had the best prices. Kids love them and so do we!
1,"Fast, Reliable, easy to use. Best qUAD Core Processor"
1,"I had purchased an Apple TV, most recent generation, and hated it. The touch screen was too touchy, and ultimately it just never functioned properly so I returned it (to Costco). Instead, I bought this product because it had all of the online channels (except Apple TV but who cares) and it has Alexa, which frankly is better than Siri (and I say that despite being very pro Apple)."
1,It was really a good idea to buy it during summer. Kids had great time in between other summer activities.
1,"I have tried the Roku and Vizio streaming boxes, and Fire TV blows them away. I have also tried several streaming sticks. The Fire TV box is more responsive, has a higher quality remote, and Alexa adds fantastic value with speech commands that are fantastically integrated. For those wanting to utilize 4k streaming this is a great start with small investment."
1,I haven't used it yet because it is attached to my other tv set. but I'm sure i will be please with my purchase.
1,I bought this for a friend's birthday. He loved it. He is a heavy reader and he couldn't believe how amazing the kindle was.
1,Great little tablet for watching amazon prime movies.
1,I bought this and like it very much also love doing business with best buy I will buy from best buy from now on.
1,"We bought 4 of these, 2 for family and the others for our 6year old and out almost 2 year old. Overall a good tablet for kids, they don't quite understand the set- up of it. Because theirs so many un- needed, pre- installed apps. But they're getting the hang of it."
1,Amazon fire is perfect for kids and other teens. Its not that expensive compared to ipad while the quality of product is pretty good.
1,My nephews love their new tablets!! Great Christmas gifts!
1,Christmas gift for 21 yr old son..He loves it Great price was only able to find white one at Best Buy. Great service at Fort MYERS FL store also
1,Excellent product at a excellent price. I like the item that I have.
1,"This is my first e-reader. I like it so far. Easy to use interface. The ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower."
1,So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
1,I got this for my grandmother who does a lot of reading and playing games. She hasn't put it down!
1,I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.
1,Hands down the best. I had a nook for years and rarely used it. I have already read 5 different books on the kindle and it's a much smoother experience.
1,"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
1,"Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too."
1,"Can't say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get."
1,"Love this, does exactly what they said it would and more,"
1,A nice tablet for the money. I use the Fire as a secondary tablet to by iPad but I find I use it as much as the iPad. Great for traveling because of its size. I am happy with the purchase. I have found that it charges fine when using the cord/plug that comes with the unit but charges slow if you use a different cord/plug.
1,"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
1,"I love everything about this tablet. The look, feel, speed, and ease of use are perfect for my 8 year old. I bought several of these at Christmas time."
1,Love it's portability and and sound love all my Amazon echo items
1,My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
1,We love this tablet. I bought it for my 4 and 6 year old daughters for Christmas. They have been able to used them with ease.
1,This product works the same as the firestick but is suppose to have 4K and better quality. To be honest it looks the same on our 70 inch 4K tv. This product does not come with the cords to hook it up. So you need to buy an hdmi cord and an Ethernet cord which adds to the cost. But I do love the Amazon product compared to other devices.
1,Was reviewing offers across all the sites and ended buying from BestBuy. Service was fast as expected. Product was packed properly.
1,We hooked this into our control 4 system and just love using it to turn lights on and off ....along with tv's and tv lifts
1,I purchased the Echo as a gift for someone else who seams to be enjoying the product.
1,"This item is great to play music, news constantly changing and adding things to make it better. I have bought three of these. Absolutely love them. Take traveling with me also."
1,I have bought 3. 2 were for gifts and everyone loves the tablet.
1,This next to the fire stick I must say have been the best pusrchases ive made to date. This takes over your cable and you can cancel your cable right away. Even more when you get kodi on it.
1,It works great.
1,Love my fire tv. I brought a sock earlier but this more stable and quick. Definitely would buy again.
1,It nice and simple clean looks nice.I'm really glad the bestbuy rep suggested
1,The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
1,"very handy, should be included with the kindle."
1,As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
1,Love the paperwhite! Best Kindle yet. easy on the eyes!
1,Definitely a good learning tool for children. Easy
1,Connected hardwire to the home network. Added Playstation Vue. Very Happy. Some limits on live sports can be a problem.
1,Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She's have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it.
1,It was not expensive great for the price I'm happy
1,Overall I'm happy with this device (generation 2 )
1,Purchased it for my daughter. She love this very much. It is really good.
1,the amazon dot with alexa was the hit of the day at my back yard bbq. the over the hill group had a blast requesting oldies from our days of youth. music from all genres was available from the 50's up to today's country hits. we also enjoyed bantering with alexa from time to time.
1,"Alexa was so easy to set up and it has so many features that you can use. I like to do trial and error using Alexa, it is so much fun. I ask her to wake me up in the morning and it really worked. I have been having so much fun, since I bought it."
1,"First of ALL is Alexa understand me well especially with my diction accent not like Siri, Google, Cortana and other. They are all confused due to my accent but not Alexa. It answers all of my questions and inquiry in anything. Actually we now have 2 of this Amazon Echo, Home and Work."
1,Great tablet for the money. Good way to see if you prefer a tablet or a laptop without spending a bunch of money to find out. Works good to stream movies or surf the web.
1,It's a good tablet for a good price I also love the free trial of amazon prime
1,Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!
1,I like that you can set parental setting so the kids can't purchase without you knowing about it. Great warranty also as a separated for the kids and the parents
1,"excellent, good to handle easy for ant teenage to used"
0,"Good tablet but very limited in apps, only to basic surfing"
1,My niece and Sister loved this. It seemed to be a big hit and helped them with another way to watch netflix...
1,Wanted to get my wife an upgrade to her old Kindle and this was it. Works great and she likes the fact that it is in color.
1,Amazon knocks it out of the park with this Fire TV. Very easy to use and runs apps faster than Roku. Well worth the money
1,This is fourth one.As I upgrade I give my old ones to my kids and bought some for the family.
1,Bought for spouse and finally got her to give up her Sony ereader. She loves it and I'm a hero. Kindle is probably one of the greatest technology items of all time.
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
1,"I picked up three of these during the holiday sales as gifts for family members. We have many Kindles that we use daily the last few years and been satisfied will all of them and Amazon offers all the content you could need for a base tablet. Great for adults or the kids (with a proper protective case). Books, video, music, and games...performs well on all. The only con I can think of is Amazon is a little weak in the app variety department, nowhere near the offering of iTunes but for the price and performance, this tablet can't be beat."
1,Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
1,The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
1,Does exactly what it's made for. Nice and clear screen perfect for reading.
1,"El libro electrónico es muy práctico, puedes tener todos los libros ahí."
1,"I love the paper white kindle. Its exactly what I expected, I love that it doesn't glare and I can read anywhere."
1,This is a cool tablet for entry model. has everything you need to get going. Its a little difficult for a child but they can catch on quick.
1,Great for Kindle.
1,"Echo is easy to setup and use. Manage grocery lists, play favorite music, purchase items right off Amazon!"
1,Nothing beats coming home and reading at night before going to sleep. Plus not having to take the extra space for each books.
1,Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price.
1,I love my echo. Just getting use to the many applications it can be use for.
1,"Amazon Fire is great for people who use Kodi. Great varieties of movies, music, and tv shows you can access."
1,This is the best gift I think I ever got my girlfriend. She uses it everyday and reads more than ever! She loves it!!
1,"The Amazon Fire 7"" tablet is solidly built, dependable, and performs well in all areas. A great purchase."
1,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing."
1,"If you have prime membership, this is a must-have to maximize the benefits amazon offers to you."
1,Super device to turn any TV into Smart TV. Really good device.
1,This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.
1,I bought this tablet for my kids on Xmas and they really like it ..
1,This is a very good product. But if purchased this product won't use Google play stuff!
1,I have had a previous kindle before and so I already knew what to expect getting. Text is clear and the back lighting makes it crisper depending on the lighting of the room you are reading in. In the dark if I put the backlight on it is possible to read but personally it hurts my eyes. So I bought a separate LED clip on book light. I use Amazon all the time so it's the company I prefer to buy ebooks from.
1,Brought this for my granddaughter for Christmas...she loved it! No complaints...happy child.
1,The biggest reason to buy this item is the convenience and battery life. On those two items the kindle delivers. It is not as paper white as I would like. It does lag a bit but overall if you are a book lover this will be a good add on for trips and when you want to read outside.
1,I love my Amazon Echo. We use it on the outdoor kitchen/patio. It has a very good speaker and access to my Pandora Music. It does so much more including instant weather reports. Several friends have purchased one as well.
1,"Bought this ""cheap"" tablet not expecting much. This thing blows away many of the more expensive android tablets. The Amazon system within the android system works great and filters out many of the android bugs that plague most tablets. Perfect for kids and the ""I just want it to work"" crowd."
1,I love my fire tv. The only thing I don't like is my remote keep freezing. I have already change the batteries to brand new ones twice and it still freezes. I'm ready to buy a new remote.
1,"This is a must for anyone, i use it for music but it has so many more options daily added!"
1,"I bought one for my Dad, liked it so much I bought one for myself. Even better than the paperwhite."
1,Easy to setup and many addons to use.I now use my fire more than my tv.
1,Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.
1,I do not know much about this tablet and have not quite figured out how to use it yet but it seems like a great little tablet for a first time user.
1,My children love playing their games on this tablet. It works well.
1,Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome!
1,Awesome product. Lightweight and easy to carry. Love it
1,So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
1,This little tablet I bought for my dad who is totally new to the tablet experience. He now loves it. He is now top of news and YouTube. I think it's great deal the amount the money spent. Of course camera is bad but speakers are good enough
1,My daughter loves this. It isn't an ipad but it does all that a good tablet should do with ease.
1,"I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8"". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses."
0,I bought this Tablet for my son and he loves it. The pictures are clear and the battery charge holds a long time. Excellent Tablet for the low price.
1,I love this product it is simply amazing. I has so many options for adding games and apps.
1,"This kindle replaces a previous model. The size is great, fits easily into purse or gym bag. The touch screen is a nice improvement over my earlier model. The backlit screen is good. Bright enough but not too bright. Overall, I am very pleased"
1,The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
0,"It's nice & cool but it responds extremely slow. Compared to modern tablets & phones kindle is just too slow. My expectation would be to make it faster even if I have to charge it often that would be ok, secondly there should be a Home button & back button on the body of kindle."
1,"The new Amazon Fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. The performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. The biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of Fires.There are a few downside issues, however. First, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. There are numerous light/hot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. After a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.The software library is the second biggest issue. Amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the Google and Apple stores.The last issue I have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.Amazon developed the Fire tablet to sell other Amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. Web browsing is much better than my first Kindle Fire, and I think better than browsing on an iPad. The app that surprised me the most is the e-mail client, and how easy it is to use. In my opinion, it's a LOT better than the native e-mail client on the iPad, or a Windows tablet.If the build quality as good as a iPad or Samsung tablet? No, not even close, but for $50 it's pretty good device if you don't mind dots of light around the edge."
1,"Plenty of capability for e-mail, games and other app's. They each have one now and love them more than the standard tablets."
1,"From Out the Box she was Absolutely Wroth the Money, A perfect Addition to my Tech And Home!!!!"
1,Works great. Was easy to set up and has great quality output and plenty of apps that can run on it Only complaint is too much focus on Amazon content.
0,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product
1,I purchased Kids edition for a gift and got this one for myself. The price was great. This is my third Kindle.
1,"Amazon Echo, a great purchase for my home, play music, good home automation, and easy setup. Don't delay, purchase today!"
1,"Amazing box I love everything it offers, this is perfect for everything you are looking to stream live for :)"
1,I bought the kindle fire not to long ago but wasn't happy with it because of the glare and lack of a backloght which hurt my eyes. I was hesitant to but another kindle but im glad I did! This is exactly what I needed to replace the fire. It's a little small but so much better than what I had before
1,Solid tablet if you want to read and do basic internet
1,I bought 2 of these...my 7 year old twins love them. Amazon has a lot of free games that we have downloaded for them and they can watch amazon and netflix and i bought the kidproof cases.
1,"Buying this tablet, has been GREAT! LOVE IT. Now I can get on the internet, when I am in my chair"
1,Bought for my daughter for middle school reading. It's perfect
1,"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update."
1,This product allows me to save over a hundred dollars on my cable bill.
1,I've made my home into a smart home and the echo and echo dot we boght make it easy to control all aspects of the home.
1,Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
1,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO YOU. This product is really light and portable. You can carry it to café or library for reading. There is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. The only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. But this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. I think it is acceptable. I bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. So it really worth it.
1,Its a Kindle with Amazon and for only $40. Its a win regardless its for yourself or a gift for family.
1,I enjoy my fire tablet and I like it is HD picture
1,It does almost all the things the more expensive Kindles do for a lot less $. Screen resolution is decent and it is a nice e reader.
1,"My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
1,Very happy with my purchase
1,"This tablet is incredibly inexpensive. I have an iPad mini, a windows tablet and another older Fire tablet and this newest version is one of the best tablets I have seen! It's quick, has a great screen and the battery is great. I bought this to take on a trip to SF and used it both ways on the plane to watch movies I had downloaded and used it over the weekend while I was there and didn't have to charge it the whole time. I like that they moved away from the carousel and just have the app icons listed the way they are now. I have recommended this to a lot of my friends, especially the ones with kids."
1,This tablet is the perfect size for my kids. It has great parental controls functions and ordering apps is easy through Amazon.
1,We bought this to watch movies and read. It doesn't disappoint.
1,"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
1,Great features. Very smooth operating system. Better than Apple TV in my opinion
1,For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
1,Just the right size for travel and resolution is amazing.
1,Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
1,"Great options, but could always have more. More apps!"
1,Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
1,I love it! I also have a fire stick. I got the firetv box thinking if I need to run Ethernet I can. But I've had no reason to. Processor is great!
1,Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.
1,"A bit difficult to get working with other smart home devices. After Some trial and error with my smart things hub, and IFTT commands it works great. Would increase to five star review if it was a bit easier to get up and running."
1,I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.
1,This tablet is the best I have seen for $50. The screen is very readable which is more than I can say for anything else at this price.
0,"I wasn't aware of all the apps that needed a premium membership for playing music. That was a disappointment, but other than that I enjoy the product."
1,Nice for kids. Has parental control for apps and other functions.
1,"I own several tablets, and in my opinion, the Amazon Fire tablets most closely mimic the traditional desktop computer experience. They are perfect for those with limited computer proficiency. They are also much more user friendly than the iPad devices - and a lot less expensive too!"
1,"excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost"
1,I love this box. Family time with my family a a very low price
1,So this thing sucks not many apps work on the amazon fire stick. It is better than the box but still blows chucks.
1,The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
1,"For the price this tablet is a very good choice, purchased one for my girlfriend and I and are very happy with them. Good processing capability and resolution is what is expected."
1,Really like all the features. All the apps. You really don't need cable tv anymore.
1,Great product for great price. As described.pleased with purchase
1,This is one sweet little tablet for taking along with you wherever you.go. It is everything you need in an ereader. The color and resolution on a $50 tablet is impressive. My mother is able to use it without problem and she loves the portability.
1,Purchased the Amazon Echo for my sons birthday and he loves it.
1,This has a nice screen with good color. Also easy to manuever around the apps
1,I bought it for my mother for Christmas and she loved it and she has not put it down since she has gotten it
1,Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet
1,"works great easy to get connected and running, have not had any issues with buffering"
1,"Kids loved these tablets, and in not worried about them dropping them"
1,this thing has everything. i bought the box because it is way faster that the stick
1,Good product. Can add apps to it. Sister loved it.
0,Its an okay product. It is geared towards amazon users. Doesn't have apps that roku or apple tv have. I got it for the direct now and it froze every time I used it.
1,Since I purchased mine the wife thought she would also like one so we picked up her one and she is using it a lot.
1,"Excellent for avid readers, this has all the bells and whistles"
1,I love how my son continues to use this tablet on a daily basis and he is only five years old.
1,"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
1,Great for kids. Bought both colors for two of my kids.
1,Fire tv works great except for sometimes has issues connecting and staying connected to wifi.
0,"We purchased the tablet on December 4th, 2015 and by January 8th, 2016 the tablet shut off completely and does not work an will not turn on. This was a waste of money."
1,"Bought it for our daughter and she loves it. Great for reading, playing games, and research."
1,"I bought it for the options with the smart home integration. I am quite pleased with the 3rd party integration with nest, Lutron and others. I am not so into the skills with games that it offers. It seems to be the best on the market so far."
1,"At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.."
1,This has been a good tablet for my daughter to use for entertainment and for learning.
1,I purchased this for my son overseas as he had broken the screen on his last one. When he opened it he was amazed at the size and weight of this one. He also was very elated that all his books that he purchased immediately downloaded to the new one with his bookmarks in place. All in all a great purchase from an excellent company.
0,I like the tablet. Great price. But the charging cord is to short and there isn't an indicator light to inform you when the tablet is charging.
1,Excellent all the way around. Enjoy camera to take pics of surprised looks on peoples faces.
1,Great price .. great tablets for kids .. recommend the tablet
1,Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a tablet.
0,I bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. It's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. One feature I did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.
1,"This multifunctional device is amazing. After downloading the apps, your possibilities are endless."
1,My 6 year old loves it easy to use has lots of apps
1,Love my kindle. Good idea to save some space around the house . The size is great for my bad eyes .
1,This is my 3rd Kindle e-reader and it's the best yet. Text is clear and device is light. Considered the newer Voyage and Oasis but I believe this is a better deal. It was worth the upgrade from the prior Paperwhite.
1,"I bought this for a friend, Kim does are easy to learn on."
1,We can't get enough of it! We use it daily and even our kiddo can use it.
1,The screen is perfect for me to read all my favorite books.
1,I'm an owner of Apple TV. But for price and features this Amazon Fire TV beats it. Highly recommend it.
0,In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.
0,"Bought these for my 4 & 5 year Olds so I wasn't expecting top of the line performance, especially for 39 bucks. Pros- Good clarity Easy to useCheapExpandable storage with SD cardCons-Slow down loadsCheap camera (as expected)No mic for voice recognition. Would have been great for the kids to Google search."
1,"Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight"
0,"Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why Amazon doesn't include it with the Kindle. I know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. Amazon should include this with the Kindle. So, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the Kindle to get the real price of the Kindle. That is why I gave it three stars. Come on Amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the Kindle."
1,Alexa is a useful tool to have around the house and she helps us with simple tasks and needs.
1,"It took me a long time to buy an e-reader because I just love real books. But I am happy I bought this and so far, after a few months, I've experienced none of the discoloration that other users have mentioned about previous versions. Very happy with it."
0,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
1,Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
1,Very happy with the performance of the fire tv. I also have first gen fire stick and the load time and lack of buffering on the fire tv is great. I'm also a prime member and the quantity of programming is pretty god. Would definitely recommend.
1,"Easy to read in any light, Battery seems to last forever, size & weight easy to carry along everywhere."
1,This tablet is so great for school children to play and learn on.
1,I love my new Kindle. It is bigger than the last Kindle I had. This Kindle is much easier to handle and to read.
1,"The Fire replaces my Kindle reader and serves this purpose well. When using as a tablet with WIFI on, battery runs down very quickly but oh well just need to charge often. Really like the camera. Not the greatest pics but again serves my purposes well."
1,"This device is easy to set up. Paired with wireless router, and loads video content quickly."
0,"This tablet disappointed me from the beginning. I loved my previous Fire tablet. However, this new one disappointed me from get go. I do not want it to tell me what I like or want! I do not like ads that pop up, I do not want suggestions for me on books, movies or anything else. I know what I like! I definitely do not want it talking to me! In this day and age, with identity theft prevalent, I would like to be able to have apps without having to turn on features like location, etc.. All in all, I am ready to bust it up and throw it away!"
1,Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!
1,These are Christmas presents for my granddaughters. I am sure they will love them
1,"I purchased one for myself, then went back bought one for my niece. Then thought how much I love the ease and function of the Kindle got my sister one. I can't say how much I use my Kindle my niece and sister agree best gift I every gave them."
1,I got this as as gift and I am so happy with it. It is like having music on demand and so much more. Thanks honey
1,Great tablet so far. I bought it as a gift andhave heard no complaints
0,"It's fine, but not necessary. Had I known that I could charge my Kindle with my tablet and/or phone charging cord I would not have bought it."
1,"Good intro tablet. 8GB is not much space, but it is a good starter for someone new to a tablet. For those that cannot afford an iPad or similar, this is a step down of course, but its a good introduction."
1,Easy to read at the beach or in bed love my kindle
1,I enjoy using this product but doesn't get as many apps and games as the android!
1,The process of creating profiles and tweaking parental controls was easy and painless.
1,Every thing I've read about the fire stick is true
1,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
1,"Amazon Fire TV is really easy to setup. It also has given me an easy way to stream 4K media for any service, Amazon, Netflix, etc. The quality of the picture and sound is really good. The menu is easy to follow, and it is so much more advanced than the Apple TV. I especially like the App you can use to control The Fire TV from my I-phone or I- Pad."
1,"This thing is awesome next best thing to having cable. The tv show and movie content is great with the download of Kodi app. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It even has the built in alexa, which can give you local weather, traffic reports etc."
1,I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
1,I am glad I purchased the amazon fire tv. I get all the channels I want and more. Love the high def. I have been recommending it to all my friends and neighbors.
0,Great product. I bought it because I travel alot now
1,"This does everything a Tablet should do and more. The best part is that you get tons of Free, Apps that normally cost...The camera is really great, too. Battery seems to last longer than normal which is a bonus...."
1,bought this for the Grandkids they tell me it is great
1,Just what I was looking for. Needed a book that I could take on a vacation
1,Good: graphics & fast shipping. Bad: didn't like how it was like you couldn't get around putting in your credit card number.
1,Amazon Fire TV is great and works very well. Not disappointed at all.
1,I love the Echo -- plays great music and I love the sound. It's also great for turning on lights in the house. I also check the weather and news with my Echo. I also do my grocery shopping list with Echo -- it works great!!
1,Great item for each room. Easy to use and its very helpful!
1,"Once you figure out its language, you can have a moderate amount of fun, but the interactive experience could be much better."
1,Bought this to use on my travels. comes in handy surfing the web.
1,"Great entertainment,easy to use,very affordable,great education."
1,It is an easy to use tablet and my girl love it! Great price.
1,"No complaints, no issues with product. Works as expected. I use it mostly for music and controlling a few lights in my room."
1,This tablet is easy to use especially for parents who are not really good in using gadgets
1,"bought this for my kids new tv, it is very easy for them to use."
1,All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.
1,"The echo has great sound, and awesome microphones, but does not play music from youtube or find music easily even with amazon music unlimited. Bluetooth is a plus."
1,"Pleased with this purchase. Good for surfing, reading, games,email. Wish I could use it in the sun to read."
1,"I needed a tablet that both he and I could work with, and the Amazon fire has been a perfect fit!"
1,"Opened it to test it out, we decided to keep it. Awesome !"
0,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
1,Nice tablet with all the basic features needed for the daily use.
1,Love everything about this television. Quality is great!Price is great!Happy all around!
1,I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
1,Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend
1,The paper white is great after a day on the computer at work. It's so much easier on my eyes than a tablet. Love it.
1,First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week. I have Amazon prime so I get free downloads on books . It is easy to use . I think I would definitely recommend this product to others.
1,Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
1,"I love this Echo, when I need to remember something I tell Echo to do it for me."
1,We are happy with purchasing the Amazon Fire. Very easy to use and don't know what we watched without it.
1,"I haven't purchased a dedicated reader before, but bought this for a cruise where I knew it would be too sunny for an iPad, and this was easy to load up with books for my kids and I and it looked great in the bright sun while wearing sunglasses. Happy with the purchase."
1,"Durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books"
1,Got this as a housewarming for a friend who bought a new house.
1,"Bought 3 of these for Christmas presents and one for myself. Other than not allowing Crunchyroll app it does everything quite well! Internet, photo storing and editing, movies, email, games - great!! App store covers all the needs and mostly free! Love em!"
1,"As expected, light and easy to carry around. Also easy to order books with an Amazon account"
1,I love it!!! This product has been awesome for my 8 year old
1,"If you're using an older Kindle Paperwhite model (like I was), the higher resolution and additional font choices available in this model more than justify the upgrade cost.I'd recommend the white case if you can get it. It's a lot easier to find the microUSB port when you're trying to plug in a, charging cable."
1,"I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone ."
1,"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
1,Awesome product and it controls my new Sony LED Television. I only wish I had waited to purchase my first one because of the amazing sale price on this one.
1,My only problem with this tablet is that after 6 months of use it stopped charging.
1,I bought the Fire for myself and it is user friendly. We put some games on it about 1 yr later for my daughter and she actually can navigate it pretty good. So we bought her her own Fire which she is proud to be able to listen to music and play simple games.
1,"I love this tablet. It is a perfect size, works great and was very affordable."
1,"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
1,Reason I wouldn't give it a full five stars is because of the fact that is so loaded down with adware for Amazon but an awful lot of that is what makes it affordable so $49 can't beat it
1,Bought it for a gift. I do not know what else to say!
1,Great tablet! My niece and nephew love it. It is a great product for the price and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great and affordable tablet.
1,"I would have given this product 5 stars however the only thing I do not like is the limited amount of local storage space (8gb)... Other than that this is honestly my favorite piece of tech that I have ever purchased... The performance and speed is second to none, especially when connected to the internet via via hardwire Ethernet cable.. I recommend this product to everyone. Thank you."
1,Have owned several roku models and now trying firetv. Definite improvement especially after recent software upgrade. Works great with my prime account & amazon video library.
1,I brought this to upgrade from the fire stick. I am very happy with my purchase. It streams shows and movies very well.
1,Very easy to use and easy to understand. Alexa on it is awesome.
1,"This little tablet is amazing for my 7 year old! He can play games, watch movies, and read books! Most everything is free but there are some games, books, and movies that you have to buy. I'm super impressed! Great battery life too!"
1,"My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great."
1,Good size for my toddler and resolution is very good.
1,Played with a little but it's a Christmas gift. No problems with so far
1,Amazing device! Makes life easier I use it all the time
1,Purchased the Amazon Fire Box to enjoy movies. I really love the device. I am looking forward to purchasing another.
1,"We were curious about the Echo for a while, but not entirely sure how it was supposed to complement the household. Now, we know! In ways that didn't even dawn on us initially, Echo and ""Alexis"" have become a steadfast companion and assistant at the house. I'd highly recommend it!"
1,My son loves his tablet. It is very easy to use. Very stutdy.
1,"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
1,"Nice, lightweight tablet for reading and occasional web surfing. Mostly used for reading."
1,"When I first got echo for my wife and I, we really didn't have the highest expectations. It was really something we got to entertain guests. Now that we've had it for a few months, we've found so many uses for it. Turns on lights when we come home, ensures doors are locked before bed, controls the temp in the home, plays music. We love it"
1,Really really really really really really awesome.
1,I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
1,Nice screen. Time limit for kids is a nice feature.
1,Love my new music!. Wow all I do is ask and I get whatever I want. Love this new technology!
1,"This is my 2nd Echo, and I also have two of the smaller Dots. Amazon has now enabled multi-room music playing, with all your speakers that you've designated perfectly synced with each other. It also serves as a good quality Bluetooth speaker so you can use it with any other app on your device for sound. I also use it to control my connected lights and can even operate my entertainment system through a logitech hub. And, the voice assistant Alexa is just getting smarter and smarter with every passing month. Get it on sale when it's under 100 dollars and it makes one of the most useful electronics purchases you could make!"
1,This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
1,Excellent for beginners. Or anyone that wants to start with a tablets.
0,We use this as an extra tablet for the coffee table and it does everything we need for a basic tablet
1,"I've only had one box failure since I cut the cable cord years ago and Amazon stood by replacing it because it was an odd occurrence. I have several of these -- they work great not only with Amazon features, but with Hulu, Netflix and other streaming media options. I tried a Roku unit from a friend once and didn't like it. The Fire TV, on the other hand, is very easy to use."
0,"Once connected to my wi-fi, it would not connect to daughters wi-fi when I visited her. The loading time for programs is really slow. Oh well, what did I expect for only $49??"
1,"Very lightweight! Just as nice as the next one up that you can only buy online. Would recommend this to all my friends and family,"
1,"I use this item mostly for music but I love alexa. She is very knowledgeable. The downside is you have to use the Alexa app for some functionality but I don't mind. I just don't like that you have to say the app when using some skills. Like, ""Alexa, use tracker to find my phone."" Instead of ""Alexa, find my phone."" You have to remember what the skills names are."
1,To date I've experienced 0 issues. I'm a cord cutter and Amazon Fire tv has helped make that possible.
1,Granddaughters Christmas gift. She loves it & the external micro SD slot enables her to download a bunch of stuff.
1,"Neat device, plays music with decent audio and allows me to control my WeMo devices."
1,"The display is even better than the paperwhite, I didn't think they could do that. The page buttons take a minute to get used to but I love them now."
1,It is as expected. For a tablet that cost $50.... Not bad
1,this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
0,Q: What's the difference between a 19.99 Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Supply and a 5.95 5V 1A (1000mA) USB port power supply - UL ListedA: 14.04 Calling it a 5W charger rather than a 5V 1A charger is a distinction without a difference.
1,works like it should
1,This is the best purchase. It has everything and 4k is amazing
1,I love the price and also the navigation. It was easy for set up very Convenient and light to carry. The screen is also very visible not blurring like other brands.
1,Lots of fun and entertaining. Bought this for my parents to keep them active in the technology world and they love it. Great purchase that works great for them. Especially when they tell it to control the lighting I setup in their home.
1,"easy to use , sound is great, i use it any where in the house"
1,"The fianc wanted one because she's a heavy reader and it's easy, convenient and portable. Was a only 40$, probably the best money I spent too make her happier."
1,"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
1,"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
1,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
1,Great gift for any age. Parentallocks awesome. Expandable sd slot too
1,I like the tablet. This is my 2 and tablet the first was a zeepad. Zeepad was a piece of you know what. I like the Fire though.
1,"Much more than a Bluetooth speaker. It is great to listen to music from Pandora, Amazon, etc with it streaming directly from wifi. Saves the battery on my phone. As others have said I wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but I guess they didn't put that in to save battery life. Maybe something for the next generation TAp"
0,"It's going to take more work to get her up to useful capacity, but she has a nice speaker for music in the kitchen."
1,It's a great value for the price point of the tablet
0,i bought it as a replacement for my son's tablet that got broken. he likes to watch kids youtube app in the evening when we are winding down but with amazon you cant get any youtube apps just some terrible knock offs which was the point for getting to begin with. the orice was great though!
1,Glad I decide to purchase it on black Friday . You can do anything on it.
0,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
1,Bought this after reading and watching a number of reviews. It was a mother's day gift for my wife. She loves it. She gets to tell it what to do - and it listens. Highly Recommended.
1,"Love the compact size, ease to read, ability to easily access library and back lighting makes this a great product."
1,Great value for the price grabbed 2 of these for the kiddos. They are capable of playing games and with the know how you can put Google play store on them.
1,Got this on Black Friday for $35.00. Bought it for my wife and she loves it for Web surfing.
1,"my son uses it to learn about the internet. down loaded some games. that he can play and have fun with. was a little small. I wish I got a bigger one. but it was a good price. still need to figure out how to do more with it. like take pics,"
1,"Great for surfing the web, books, You Tube and email so far. Love the size too ."
1,Its very good tablet for the price. I have owned previous versions
1,I like it because we move it around the house &I to the garage and pool area.
1,"I reviewed many similar products to help with our cord cutting. For it's price and good reviews from many independent reviewers it is the best for the money and easy to set up and you. It has such a wide variety of apps, you can get more than what you get on cable for less."
1,I bought as a gift and it seems to be a pretty good tablet the only down side is the quality of the camera. The picture quality is not great
1,"My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose."
1,Haven't had any issues until recently my son's tablet won't charge anymore. Called geek support but they couldn't locate warranty so I'll have to go in
1,My grand daughter has her educational apps on her tablet and enjoys them tremendously!
1,I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.
1,Great item for the price. Love the fact that you can hard wire to your internet for lightning fast streaming.
0,I wasn't really impressed. The remote broke within 1 hr of using it and had to return it.
1,Perfect gift for friend or family member!!! Very easy to use!
1,This is a great inexpensive tablet for beginners. It also has access to Amazon Prime's Library for Music and Video. I would highly recommend it.
1,Bought it for a child. He works it very easily. Would recommend
1,This is an excellent product especially for the price
1,I have four siblings and it keeps them quiet days they're home
1,"Picture is top-notch...4K capable. Also, something I discovered on my own that the ""experts"" in the stores did not know or tell me: even though you don't have a 4K capable TV, the Fire Box may still be what you want instead of the Fire Stick...here's why: when you watch live news or sports they are broadcast at 30 frames per second. The Fire Stick only can produce 20 frames per second, so the picture looks somehow ""previously recorded""...jusy not like a sharp, high-def pucture. So I replaced the Fire Stick on my 1080p capable TV with the Fire Box and, BINGO!, perfect...because it can reproduce 30 frames per second! You'll see the difference, trust me!!!"
1,Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!
1,It's a great product I enjoy the amazon fire stick
1,"I like the fire tablet. It is great for checking emails, playing games, etc. Without the expensive cost."
1,Anti-glare is awesome. Clear and bright. Touchscreen is nice!
1,"Great phone for any level of android user, starting from a beginner to an advanced root user, camera can be better though"
1,This is my 4th paper white. I travel A LOT and i never leave home with out it. Its ez to use and set up.
1,"Because the devices are very popular, they work great for tying different devices together that otherwise wouldn't be compatible. Our smartthings hub with haiku fans for example. Takes a bit to get used to talking to your house and devices, but helps when people come over and don't have the apps on their phones/devices."
1,Love the fire. I run it nonstop 24 hours a day for my business and it runs flawlessly.
1,I bought this as a gift and it has performed perfectly. Can't beat at this price.
1,Great little dash cam that does not get in the way. Bought two and 1 was defective out of the box but returned and got another. Nice color screen and a lot of bells and whistles for something this small
1,"This is my second Kindle (the first one lasted several years). I enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light. The backlight works very well and does not have the eye strain that a tablet may have. With the touch surface, I find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several pages. The side page turn works very well. Much easier to travel with this unit than a large book."
1,This is my second purchase of an Amazon Echo. I use the Echo for everything from an alarm clock to a radio to a source for news and weather. It is an intuitive device.
1,Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I want one now.
1,"I'm so glad I purchased this! I did have the older version with the smaller screen and what a difference it makes having the larger screen! It's volume & clarity are great, it's light and easy to use. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is on the fence and thinking about purchasing it."
1,Needed something smaller than my Samsung 10 inch tablet to carry around and this worked great.
1,Love this tablet. Easy to use. Battery life great!
1,Great for a beginner. My son used it like a pro. .
1,Perfect compact and powerful.. The Amazon Fire Tv is an amazing piece of hardware.
1,I started the set up process and it automatically pulled over the ebooks I had on my iPad app. Then I started adding more books. Just wish I would have bought more memory!
1,"This is my first kindle purchase, and I couldn't be happier with it. Before I bought it I was very concerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on, but my concern was soon expunged. I have always read books, then as I grew older and my eye sight grew worse, I moved to reading on my iPad Air because I could increase the size of the print. The downside to my iPad though, was that it would get heavy to hold as I read, and after a while I would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device, even in night mode to a point, even though that was much better. So I decided to try the Kindle Paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type. I couldn't be happier with it. It's light to hold, even in one hand, which I do a lot, I can still adjust the type size to what I want, the type is very crisp and easy to read, and I find that I don't get the eye strain that I used to. One other benefit to the Kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside, which can not be said for the iPad.Another benefit to the Kindle is that if I still feel like reading the book for a while on my iPad, using the free Kindle app, my iPad syncs perfectly with my Kindle, so that it will start on the same page that I stopped on with my Kindle, so that I can seamlessly move from one device to the other.The only slight disappointment that I had with it, was that the battery doesn't last as long as they lead you to believe. I found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book, but realistically that's no big deal to me.If you are debating on whether or not the Kindle Paperwhite would be right for you to read on, my recommendation is to buy it. I don't think that you will be disappointed."
1,Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks
1,If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
1,I love my new kindle. It is everything that I want. My only concern was that the store didn't carry the right case or the screen protector.
1,"I absolutely love this item, it is very easy to use and works well in my office"
1,I bought this for as a gift for my daughter. she love it!
1,The fire tv works well with wifi or hardwired. Great for streaming netflix or sling tv.
0,"She is like my personal assistant, but I wish she is as smart as Siri... but since there is no one else like her, she will do for now."
1,"Great sound, love all of the things that connect with the echo.I use philips hue for turning off & on lightsWish it had a built in battery like the tap does"
1,"I just love my kindle fire but it's a little heavy to carry with me. That's why I wanted to buy the kindle paperwhite. It's light weight so it fits nicely in my purse or my work bag.I just love the no glare, I'm able to read at night or outside, at work on lunch break. It's great glad I did buy it. Worth every penny."
1,"Have the original fire hd, but wanted another one. this one is great because of the camera."
1,My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
1,"This is a very great product, I love all the movies"
1,"I didn't expect to receive a premium tablet, but with this device it's great. I got more than I bargained for great job Amazon"
1,Very useable device for the low cost. The screen is very bright and easy to read.
1,"Kindle fire is an awesome tablet for reading, browsing..Color is amazing"
1,I love the fire sticks and this is definitely the top dog. Very fast.
1,It works well and you can do a lot of things on it.
1,"The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it."
1,"Works really good, highly recommended. Would definitely buy to a friend or family member."
1,I use this everyday. It's a great buy. Everything you need is ready to go as soon as it turned on.
1,I love the fact that I can play my favorite music and ask anything from silly questions to definitions of things
1,"You will not regret this purchase! The kindle holds a charge for more than a week, is super light weight, easy on the eyes, and allows you to define words with the point of a finger! It even adds defined words to a vocabulary list, so you can review them! ♡♡♡♡♡"
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is great for reading books on the go. The battery lasts me for weeks between charges based on my light reading habits. It is very easy to just close the cover when I get to a pausing point, and knowing it will open immediately to the same page when I resume reading. The back light makes it easy to read anywhere, from full sunlight to dark rooms. I'm resuming my voracious reading habit now that the Paperwhite has made it so easy."
1,"Compact, great playback quality. Heard about this device through a friend and I love it. Clarity is great! Understands commands quickly and concisely."
1,purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.
1,Does everything I need and has a long battery life.
1,"I absolutely love the versatility of the Echo. Make calls, play music, traffic reports, the skills are great. We have a couple Dots in other rooms so we don't have to yell throughout the house to tell the kids it's time for dinner, just use the ""drop in"" feature."
1,It's great. This was a gift but my son loves it. Recommending it.
1,"I love my new paperwhite. I had previously had a generation 1 and a generation 2 kindle. This is a tremendous step up. I usually use my kindles for reading on the beach. I love that it is small and fits in my beachbag or purse. I like the back light on it also. If I had to make one constructive criticism I would have liked the page turning to be more like turning the page on a book like the kindle app on my phone works. Occasionally, if I don't hit the page turn in the right spot I get other ""stuff"" that shows up. Not a huge deal but I would like it to be more intuitive in that regard."
1,"My son loves this, uses it for internet access and listening to music."
0,I have not personslly used this item but it was a requested gift for family member so they obviously were aware of benefits. No complaints so far so guess it's good
1,Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
0,"The reason people give it 5 stars is because they don't give the product enough time before they review it. I purchased this along with my kindle dx on August 12, 2010. I can honestly say that I don't recommend this product as it will damage the kindle. The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better. One thing I can honestly say is that I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted it to work. I'm looking for a slip cover now."
1,"We are thrilled with our ""Echo"" Alexa is a wonderful and useful addition to our family and daily life. We continue to find new ideas and uses for her all the time and are amazed how helpful it is to have her close by.thank you so much for this ""genius"" ."
1,This is an excellent product - speaker quality is amazing.
1,Great tablet. My kids love it. Great for the prices.
1,"I've had my Echo for a few months. Set up was easy. The voice recognition has been excellent. Alexa hears and responds to all of my requests, as well as the TV occasionally! I love its capability to connect to other speakers via BLUETOOTH. And it is a lot of fun for the family and parties!"
1,"Once this is hooked up to your wifi it is a great little product. I tried hooking it up on my computer but it went much more easily on my smart phone. You can ask it almost anything and she will respond. Plays music tell you jokes, etc. You will have to subscribe to a music service. Pandora is free as are many other services. Once subscribed you just have to ask her to play your favorite music and it will play all day! Oh it can also be used as an alarm to wake you up each morning."
0,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.
1,"When my Kindle Paper White was damaged (my fault), I was looking for a replacement. After reading many reviews online, both from ""experts"" and normal users, I chose the Voyager. I've been very satisfied with it. I particularly like the pressure sensitive edges for turning pages."
1,"Picked up the Amazon echo on sale and have loved it. It's great to have Alexa play an artist or band I want, here how the weather is, or current news. It's been a great addition to our house."
1,"Kids love it I don't get to use it they take it over , really want the other things to come with it but to expensive they should have bundles for them ."
1,"Very easy setup, I recommend hard wiring, if possible, it has all the apps we use, including Sling TV!"
1,"This is a great tablet for the money. It works for what I need it for; checking emails, downloading books and magazines. Great price and very lightweight. I was able to Facebook Messenger my sister who lives in Alaska, which is something I had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop. So I am happy."
1,Nice tablet for a great price as I purchased per black Friday sale on-line
1,Love using it! What I like best is the fact that more than one person can be registered.
1,Works with all my smart devices.. and the white looks cool
1,"Exciting for the family entertainment, enjoying all music"
0,"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store."
1,"Had been thinking about purchasing this for some time and decided to take the plunge. It was easy to set up and the sound is very good, which was surprising. It's in our kitchen, so we use it in the morning when we are getting ready to leave for work and at night when we are preparing dinner. It's useful for getting a brief rundown of the news, listening to some local radio, or playing some tunes. We have it set up with our NEST, but don't have anything else really automated so I can't comment on that. I probably paid more attention to Alexa initially when we bought it, but now can go days without speaking to Alexa. Can't we all?"
1,Just Love Alexa and all she does and can do with additional technoilogy!
1,Wife enjoys using the Kindle reader so much that I may have to purchase a second one for me!
0,This item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge. We may have to return. I assume it is this unit and not all.
1,I had the older version. This new version is definitely faster and it support 64 bits apps
1,My daughter loves her kindle and it's larger than the previous one she had. She enjoys it!
1,the item is good but keep frozen I need some advice
1,"Ask Alexa ANYTHING and she'll search the web. I love being able to control my lights, even when I'm not home."
1,"TWC digital adapter now returned. With Black Friday pricing this will pay for itself in months using TWC app, plus already a prime member. Have stick, but needed a little more oomph for gaming on the big screen"
1,"I bought 4 of these tablets for my daughters. I won't lie I was a little nervous every at first because of the price, but they turned out to be awesome! My kids love them. I haven't bought their cases yet but they seem to be very sturdy tablets."
1,Got it for my grandson and he really does like it.
1,Use it for reading my online textbook for class. Easy to read on and like how light and compact it is. Battery life so far has been great but I have only had it close to a month.
1,Easy to setup and use and now with voice search. I recommend it with even 4K content. Best Buy had it on sale as well.
1,"Bought it as a gift, I love mine and think everyone should have one!"
1,"This is the perfect product for listening to internet radio at the gym without having to buy a smart phone and an expensive data plan. I selected the gym's wireless signal, downloaded the Sirius/XM app, put in my earphones (purchased separately), and began listening. Since this item was part of a Black Friday sale, my total cost was well under $50. It's small enough to carry with me, and the screen is easy to read."
1,"If you are a hardcore reader, this is your Kindle! The light makes a huge difference to read under any conditions, its a big improvement from the standard Kindle, if you are unsure between one or the other, go for the Paperwhite, its worth the extra money."
0,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
1,Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games
1,"Brought 1 for my neice, nephew, and child they  it"
1,Perfect for taking on vacation and with memory cards I can take all the pics I want.
1,Just wish there were instructions in the Box instead of having to go online
1,"The Echo is not just functional, but fun. Our kids love to pick music for her to play, she has taught them to play Jeopardy, AND she keeps us organized. :-)"
1,My daughter loves this Kindle. It is so easy to upload new books and doesn't hurt your eyes while reading.
1,"Nice in the night, you can adjust the light, and does not hurt you eyes."
1,the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
1,My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
1,I am still discovering what my Echo is capable of and learning more each day. I do wish it came with the battery pack as I thought it was rechargeable.
1,"I had the dot, but it wasn’t loud enough. I’ve used my sister’s and fell in love with this one. She has the black one, so I got the white one & I love it. It blends in and works great."
1,i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
1,very good product............I would recommend this to a friend
1,I have bought 3 months ago and it is working very good. my kid is enjoying on holidays
1,"extra tablet for the price well worth it using it for everyday extras ..eg weather app , face book, kindle,"
1,"I love it. It charges quickly, great display. This is my 3rd kindle, and it holds its own in comparison to my other two. Now I have one downstairs, one at bedside, and one to travel. The grandkids love them too. Now no more arguing when they visit over who gets to play."
1,"I am a long time Kindle user, but a few years back switched to a Kindle Fire, then a Lenovo Windows Tablet, and while the tablets worked well for reading, nothing beats the experience of the Kindle screen, and the paperwhite is a great upgrade on the original Kindle's screen."
1,"This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.."
1,It amazes me that this tablet is less than fifty dollars. Is it going to replace an ipad? No but it's not meant to. It is great for watching hulu and net flix. Amazon underground is pretty amazing also. Well worth $50. If you are on the fence about it just buy it. You won't regret it at all.
1,"U can do so much with this tablet, compare to the more expensive ones"
1,I had been using Fire stick which 1080P cabable. When I bought Fire TV then I saw the difference. It can stream 4K content. It comes with plenty of free apps and now I always have many options to watch. Great product.
1,Its good product with the $ amount. I feel its little slow but okay.
1,Its great to use for you're everyday work and recreation
1,Perfect reading light and long battery life. I really love it.
1,"My husband has been a kindle fan from the first generation. This one was purchased on Black Friday for a discounted cost and using BB points. So, it was a great deal for a Christmas gift given to my mother in law. Great intro level tablet and for someone who reads more than works on their tablet."
1,The processor and speed of this unit is unparalleled. As long as you have fast enough wifi (and a docsis modem) you will only get signal loss once in a great while; and it won't be the FireTv's fault. Love the plethora of apps available for various channels and the use of SlingTv with this box is a great option in place of cable/satellite.
1,"First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. ""When is the cubs game/how are they doing"" and ""What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond"" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the ""skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor. But the potential is there and it looks like Amazon is working on it."
1,"Love this product it does everything, answers questions, plays my music from iPhone plays games tells jokes etc ..."
1,The device is great to have in your home...like asking what the weather would be like...playing your favorite sound etc.
1,It does its job
1,I bought this in order to read on it while waiting for appointments. I have a larger Samsung which I love but it's bulkier and doesn't fit in my pocketbook. This is the perfect size and battery lasts longer.
1,"That's an average tablet, with considerable specs for the price, it stars fast, run apps fast, and the battery lasts for a while, around 4 hours of average use...The only limitation for me is that it doesn't have google store.If you have bought any app from that store, you'll have to buy them again from amazon store.But there are tutorials online teaching how to have google app store working on this tablet."
1,Functional for anything you want to do. Not extremely fast but works pretty great
1,This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you.
1,"Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - BlackVery cool, light weight and easy to use. Thank you."
1,"I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use."
1,"The echo can't natively control my tv and the intermediate fixes for this don't work well either. The Google home has similar shortcomings but more base when playing music which I prefer. Other than that, it really is pretty great"
1,"But, fast forwarding through content can reset the cursor and put you at the beginning of the content. And, occasionally can get you out of the application. Perhaps additional memory in a future version of this product may fix this. However, watching subscription free content is always a treat.Good solid product. I also own Roku and its interface slightly easier for elderly and those with not much patience."
1,Kindle Fire meets the needs of kids and/or adults-
1,This item was meant for my mother in law but decided to give to my 17 year old daughter she absolutely loves it
1,Really happy with this new Kindle and the fact that I can read at night and not have to use a reading light.Highly recommend
1,I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.
1,"I purchased 2 Fire tablets for my foster children, and I must say , I love them! The Fire give parents so much control over what the kids can do it. The best feature is the curfew it has on it. You can set it for a time to come on and off, and more than anything, you can set it so, they will have to spend a certain amount of time on educational activity before it allows them to start watching videos or playing games, etc. I love it!"
1,"I dropped cable tv entirely, and I purchased this device to use with my sling box. It works wonderfully and is very easy to set up. It also integrated well with my harmony remote."
1,"It is a must for Christmas gift, excellent product and price."
1,I purchased this for my girl friend and she absolutely loves it. She reads around 3-4 books a week.
1,Echo is a great addition to our home and its easy to use!!
1,Our 5 year old grandson loved it. Bought it for him to play educational games on.
1,Brother in law loves it. He's not very technical so perfect for him.
1,Can't beat the price on these tablets. They are a wonderful tablet for the money.
1,Bought two of these Dots for my granddaughters. One had asked for one - the other did not but both were very happy and excited to get them. Hope they don't use them to do their homework.
1,The recording quality is very good. I would recommend this product.
1,Nice easy to navigate and simple enough that my grandkids can learn. Also can set limits on use very important
1,Great for night reading. No bright light to hurt eyes.
1,Great for music! Speaker quality is excellent! Can listen to Pandora and also through Amazon Prime...Haven't attempted to order from Amazon Prime yet though. It will do other things as well...we are still learning!
1,"Easy to set up, Amazon gives lots of help and new ideas for using it! Fun and very helpful!"
1,I have one of these tablets so it was a no-brainer when it came to purchasing one for a friend's birthday. This tablet is small and delivers a multitude of functions.
1,300 dpi screen is impressive. The only drawback is the front-lit is not even.
1,Great tablet for destructive toddlers. My son has dropped and thrown it several times and it still works!...
1,Great product.....................................
1,"Great tablet for younger kids. Bought 3 of these as Christmas presents and the kids love them. They can play games , download learning apps, and watch shows on them."
1,I enjoy amazon TV and is easy to use that my young children can navigate it without my help.
1,This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set
1,Really enjoy our day to day interactions with Alexa
1,"I replaced an older tablet with this new version, all of my e-books transferred to the new one and I love it."
1,"Purchased this for my mother-in-law who wanted a basic tablet for FaceTime, viber, email etc. and it has been perfect for her so far. Camera is decent too and you really cannot go wrong for this price."
1,Wish it would be better at Internet look up. Or have better response to some questions that may need the internet.But it's fun and easy to use.
1,"Was looking for a device that I can load Kodi on. This Fire TV is more than capable of doing what I needed it for!!! So glad that they were sold out of the fire stick when I was looking for it, the extra memory on the Fire TV is coming in handy"
1,"This isn't going to replace a tablet or an ipad, but if you're looking for a great display to read books and magazines, you can't beat this for 50 bucks."
1,Perfect deal for Black Friday weekend. Easy to buy on line and pick up in store.
1,Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick.
1,This is my son's 4th kindle. It is reliable but the charging plug area wears out quickly
1,Bought this for a family member to get her school books on as well as entertainment. She loved it and didn't put it down.
1,It's amazing how quickly Alexa has become a central component to our household.
1,"I was hesitate to buy it since it was too cheap to be true. however, it is better than my $49 dollar Chinese table that I bought to my kid."
1,I love my new Kindle Paperwhite! Love the lighted pages and the ability to change print sizes.
1,This is definitely the Rolls Royce of the e-readers love all the new features that it has. Upgraded from the paperwhite to the voyage.
1,"Alexa is for me an amazing product that gives you facts, plays your music, can read to you and do lots more. My family loves this new electronic assistant."
1,Love the echo! Great voice recognition and very helpful for my every day life!
1,The Echo is a great product. You can ask it anything. I can not even to begin to list everything it does. If you have a tech savvy house the sky's the limit.
0,"Echo is Ok, but I am just not seeing the product value provided for the cost. Many times Alexa doesn't understand what we are saying and is extremely frustrating to my wife and child. Speaker sound is good quality, but not at all impressed with the AI capabilities."
1,I just plugged it in and connected it to my Amazon account. Super easy to use since it is voice activated. I check the weather and traffic every morning plus ask Alex almost anything.
1,I have used different streaming android boxes and Apple TV over the years. Love this one. Starts up super fast and remote is very responsive. I mainly purchased it to use it with Kodi but I like how easy you can browse Amazon prime videos. I recommended it to a few friends and family. They all love it.
1,In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price
1,"The new voyage is so much better. They've made some major improvements. I love that you can swipe, or use the side controls. The writing is crystal clear. The batter life lasts forever. I recommend this to anyone!"
1,"This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!"
1,"Really like this tablet, price is right and perfect for browsing the Web and reading books. The books on Kindle are cheaper in digital format as well so win win all around depending on whether or not you prefer a book."
1,It works great with the our new Kindle.
1,"This has been really good, easy to read and easy to transport."
1,"Its a nice product to use, very light and a long battery life."
1,"outclasses other tablets at this price point, only downside is the need to use the Amazon App Store instead of the normal Google Play Store. Great tablet for the kids though."
1,I love my new Echo! I use it daily. Great product!
1,Was nothing like i originally thought when in ought this . You have to put some work into it to get tor to work and does an ok job not perfect
1,"So I decided to pull the trigger into buying the FireTV, I've use the first version and liked it ok, I've also use the FireStick and don't think it's fast enough. You can get a lot of apps with this box and find it a bit faster than the first version. Pretty good buy in my opinion."
1,Great tool to start a smart home. Interfaces well with current apps
0,Alexa functions until yopu attempt to connect to multiple devices. Then technical suppprt is WORTHLESS!
0,very slow device for most adults. probably fine for a child
1,"This was for an employee appreciation event, the prize winner was very excited about winning the Amazon Fire!"
1,Got it for my daughter. Great tablet. It replaces a fire HD 6.
1,Alexa works beautifully and has fine quality sound.
1,We bought 3 of these on Black Friday! They work great and the whole family is happy!
1,got the new e-reader for my wife to replace her orginall 1 from bestbuy they no longer make. she said that she likes it much better it has a light in it. misses the key board
1,Lots of options and features. Can be used anywhere.
1,"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
1,"she loves it and uses it. easy to adjust type size, she is computer illiterate and needs help loading books"
1,perfect christmas gift for my mother in law. easy to use and great for reading anywhere. she loves it
1,I have had the amazon fire tv for about a month now and I think it's solid. I had the apple tv for about 3 years before this and compared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when I made this choice. The services I use (netflix and hulu plus) were available on both but since I am also a amazon prime member and the shows are generally cheaper via the amazon store I chose the fire tv. The set up was easy and I like the user interface. The system response is snappy compared to the older apple tv but I am noticing a bit more random resets and freezing with the fire tv. I suspect it's software related and can get worked out with updates. I think it's solid and would recommend the fire tv to anyone asking.
1,I like it it comes in handy to watch netflix with thank you
1,"I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups"
1,I bought the kindle for my son he go to the college he like
1,I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!
1,Tablet works great and you can't beat the price. Will do everything you need it to do and love being able to add extra memory.
1,I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars
1,"I like it a lot. Got it just to be able to get on line while husband was on the laptop but there is so much more. Very user friendly. A few basic directions and you breeze through most set ups. I can check the breaking news, weather or look up an address etc.& be out the door meanwhile the laptop is still booting. The Fire shut down (Moko case) is merely shutting the cover. Weak spot; For listening to music has rather poor sound but movies, shows, voices etc are clear & fine. Will be getting the Fire Stick shortly. No opinion on camera/video yet."
1,Great price. Easy access to apps. Simply love it!!
1,It was for my niece she absolutely loves pink. And has been playing it since I gave it to her
1,The music is great. Phil cannot read or write but loves music.
1,My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
1,"I love my new Amazon Echo, Alexa. I hooked her up with my new Philips Hue Lights and it's amazing to tell her to turn on/off lights throughout the house. I love when I walk down into the kitchen in the morning and say hello to her, she gives me a history lesson, a joke, the weather, etc."
1,"The Amazon Echo was a wonderful Christmas gift. Anything you want to know, just ask Alexa and she will answer!"
1,I love it! We have them for all our children and they love them
1,SuperFun to use.easy set up and great product.
1,"We love the fire tv so much, we have one on every tv jn the house!"
1,"We are really loving our Amazon Fire TV. We use it mostly for streaming Netflix because we haven't gotten into any of the Amazon episodes yet. We also use it for watching movies off our Amazon account. The picture quality is great and we haven't had any issues with streaming - no buffering and no freezing has occurred in the 9 months we've had the device. I like the parental control feature that requires you to put in a code before watching something. I'm not completely electronic savvy so I haven't really tried any other features on it yet. I have a Google Chromecast as well and it's my go-to for when we're traveling, but for our TVs at home, I'm very happy we got the FireTV and that it has a remote vs. using our phones or tablets. All in all, a great purchase."
1,I just love this product. This is my 2nd and this is very flexible and open as against apple TV. I replaced my apple TV with fireTVs and I just love them.
1,"This is a well made box, perfect. It uses android so there is almost nothing you can't do with it"
1,"Purchased this item for a friend, keep it for myself. Best purchase ever!!!!"
1,I bought this for my dad for christmas. He works long hours and like to watch movies and play games when he has a little break and this is perfect for just that.
1,Bought this for my son & he absolutely loves it!!!
1,I purchased for my 2year old. So I could keep her off my phone.But I use it also. It is our first tablet it is user friendly for both myself and 2year old.
1,Defiantly worth upgrading from the fire stick does not freeze nor does it get hot and need a cool down time.
1,"For the price, it cannot be beat. The screen isn't the best quality but for the price it is sufficient"
0,I bought this for my daughter during the holidays and after four months of use it would no longer would charge. I tried other charges as well and it's definitely the tablet. Now I have to go through the hassle of seeing if I can still replace it under warranty.
1,Fast shipping and very happy with the amazon fire tv.
1,"I didn't need one of these, but it seemed so cool, I took a chance. A year and a half later and I don't think I could get along without her. Shopping lists, to-do lists...I never get to store and forget why I went. You can be in your kitchen while you're throwing out an empty egg carton and just tell Alexa to add it to your shopping list. When you get to the store, it's there. No running around making lists and forgetting them. Check the weather, settle arguments. It was easy to set up and just gets easier to use."
0,"acts up a lot , but has a lot of good features. but then again i should go over the instructions."
1,For 35$ to get a reputed tablet is a no brainer. I am enjoying it!
1,This item is a must have for everyone. Very easy to use.
1,Enjoy being able to use this box to stream 4K content even.
1,"I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10"" tablets before, and this one is just the right size."
1,Its a great thing to get all the information I want really quickly and easy. I love my Alexa!!!!!!!
1,"Great, would recommend this to anyone!!! My husband will not put it down! He loves it! I also have one! The price a Best Buy was excellent!!!"
1,Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
1,I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.
1,"I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music."
1,This is very easy to use and lightweight. Very convenient
0,go for a google if you want proper answers to any of your questions.!
1,This device is lightweight and comfortable to hold. I love being able to read it in the dark
1,I specifically got this Kindle for reading outside without glare.
1,My second kindle. Paper white is really as good as old with advantage of being able to read in bed without needing extra light.
0,It was ancient technology and did not keep up with the internet.
1,Cut cable down to basic cable and now rent any shows that I watch directly from Amazon. Didn't realize how little TV I watched until I cancelled and went to Fire TV. My house is wired for LAN and I connect directly into the wall using a cat5 cable and have 80mps speed to the Fire TV. No issues with lag or buffering at all. 4k movies is a plus as well.
1,I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
1,This cute little tablet has all the great features of an iPad mini plus more. Great for kids and adults!
1,"Great little tablet for around the house . It is only WiFi capable but it is inexpensive $35.00 bfs. I use it to catch up on emails, recipes, calculator, games and so much more when I just don't feel like starting up the desk top computer. It's portable and convenient! So happy the BestBuy employee Jessica Lee suggested it, she was awesome. To think I only came in to buy a movie."
1,"I have a few Amazon Echos and Echo Dots but there are a couple of spots in my house where the original black Echo looked out of place and the white Echo looks great. Works perfectly, just like the black version."
1,the sound and pictures are great and easy to download apps.
1,"So much better than my previous kindle, I've used my new kindle daily and I'm not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well"
1,It is actually very fun and useful. Music information and helpful.
1,Better than I expected. Alexa is my new best friend.
1,I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday. Her sister already had one and the family thought it was a great tablet.
1,"It's fast, it's 1080p and you can do more with it than the others"
1,"The best streaming box on the market, hands down...just buy it, thank me later!"
1,Great product for listening to Pandora and Amazon music
0,"The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one ."
1,"Bought as a Christmas gift. I got it on Black Friday, so the price was very good. My daughter can use this in her classes and it's a great size. I even bought another one after Christmas because we liked it so much!"
1,It does the job for me. Its small and portable. Keep it in air plane mode with the wifi for longer battery life.
1,"I do most of my E-reading when we travel. I always used my I Pad, but finally replaced that with the Kindle (for reading). Nice to be able to read in the sunlight, which is not possible with the IPad. The light is also not as harsh as the IPad when reading at night. So now I travel with both."
1,This was exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to setup and to use. I found it even better than an actual book for reading. If someone is looking for a product just for reading a book this is the product to get. The only issue I had is it did not come with a recharging electrical outlet product so I had to use my computer to recharge until I got one. Now I can charge wherever without the need for a computer. If you want to just read a book this is the product to get. Can't go wrong just get the electrical outlet at the same time.
1,My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!
1,"A friend gave me a Dot, which I enjoyed. I decided to explore the other devices. I was torn between the Echo and the Tap. After reading a CNET review, I chose the Tap because it is portable. My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word ""Alexis"", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household."
1,One of the best purchases i have ever made. It works seamlessly
1,I absolutely love my kindle fire. I received cash back for purchasing a new MacBook Pro Retina laptop and purchased the Kindle and cover jacket.
1,"Great little tablet, but I was disappointed it did not wake/sleep with productive cases."
1,"I bought this tablet to use while I'm on the go. I am retired and have used a desktop my whole life. I have tried the Apple IPAD but did not want to spend the money as I have a desktop @ home. So this works just fine for limited use. I use Google, surfing the internet when waiting for something away from home, etc. Keep myself entertained!"
1,This tablet is affordable and easy to use. I highly recommend it!
1,"The Kindle Fire is el Fuego! That means it's good for what I ask it to do. I watch movies, read books, search the internet for ingredients that allow me to make delicious oatmeal cookies, and when in a pinch, this thing is just the right size to serve the cookies on also!"
1,Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
1,Nice for watch nexflix play games best item i buy .
0,"She never has an answer for anything, she has to always be connected to an outlet, too hard to connect to other devices"
1,"The Amazon Fire TV is a tiny, premium quality box that connects to any TV with an HDMI cable & provides the most intuitive & powerful interface for Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu & many more.LIKES: 1- Small, unobtrusive size 2- User friendly remote 3- Internal memory is 2Gb Flash, 16Gb Storage + Micro SD Card slot that accommodates up to 128Gb external storage! 4- Ethernet or WiFi connected. Ethernet will provide a more robust signal than WiFi, to reduce the buffering so commonly seen on lesser boxes. 5- Very easy to use6- Beautiful on screen interface / graphics7- 4K Ultra HD capable 8- You can download and save apps, movies & music on the optional external storage card 9- Voice Search on the Remote lets you speak a movie, actor, title, etc. & let the search begin!10- Alexa can search your photos & can even look for a specific individual in the photos by name DISLIKES: None! COMPARE to AMAZON FIRE STICK: The Fire Stick is a very inexpensive device that is WiFi only & has 1/2 the Flash & Memory as this Fire TV. It has no provision to add additional memory. The Fire TV connects with Ethernet cable or WiFi. Ethernet provides a much faster & stronger signal, so your movies don't freeze up. With 2X the Flash & Memory of Fire Stick + an external memory slot, the Fire TV makes skipping & frozen movies a thing of the past. CONCLUSION: I recommend a Fire TV for every HDTV you own! It is truly an amazing device & converts your existing TV, whether a Smart TV or not, to a VERY Smart TV!"
1,"I always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. But now I am loving it!"
1,Present for my husband. He is enjoying trivia questions
0,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
1,I got this for my dad for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. !!!
1,Purchased for an3 year old that wanted this badly. Appears to be rugged. Links up with my amazon account for content and access. 2 year warranty. Win!!!
1,eady enough for my 3 year old to use by herself. Can turn it on and choose her app. Comes with s protective case. Great product for kids to learn on.
1,I read reviews on Amazon some bashing it because they said the screen wasn't paper white. Well it isn't IF you have the back light off. It's white with the back light on. Even with my back light on durning daylight I still got a few weeks of read time out of this. It's amazing don't let others tell you it's not. And the adds only on the lock screen.
1,"I owned 2 Fire Sticks. I wanted a device I could hardwire my Ethernet connection and have the ability to stream 4K content, so I purchased the upgraded Fire TV Player. I'm a Primer Member so this device is a no brainer for me to fulfill my streaming needs. Highly recommended."
1,"Works amazingly! Very fast, high quality. I've already recommended to many family and friends."
1,"I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don't need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well."
1,"Alexa is pretty fun. I feel as though with updates and more"" skills"" to come in the future she will be even more helpful. As an actual speaker or sound system it's just ok. You don't really get the deep rich tones that you would with a larger higher quality system, but for like $80 Echo and Alexa is a good deal."
1,It was a Xmas girt for my granddaughter but read on it's abilities
1,Was pretty simple to use. User friendly and pretty lightweight.
1,Fire box is great. Easy start up and also to navigate thru for beginers in the streaming tv world.
0,Nice for books and games on the go so you don't have to use your phone battery
1,I got this to try out cutting the cable. Being an Amazon Prime member I knew that I had some content already available but there are so many options when you get to looking. I really like the Ethernet port that I can hard wire from my modem to make sure that I am running at max speeds.
1,I especially like it's versatility and ease of use.
1,"This does anything you can imagine, you really don't need cable"
1,Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
1,This was very easy to use and set up and it's fun to have around the house
1,"I mainly used this device to control some home automation items in the house and to watch quick youtube videos. For its price, it is a great device, do not expect it to be the greatest tablet out there."
1,This is our second Alexa unit. This one was for our son. He loves it and can listen to his own music.
1,"Love this tablet. It's perfect for kids, teens, and adults. I have 5 in my home. We all love them. Perfect for searching the Internet, playing games, keeping up with the news and TV shows you love. It connects right to my fire stick and I watch movies without hooking up all kinds of cables. Could not believe the price. Best bargain on a quality tablet. Thanks Best Buy!!"
1,The kindle paperweight is a nice sized tablet good for reading in any lighting. You're able to see it in the bright sun light as well as the dim lit room
1,Sets itself up. Has everything I need. Will buy several more. Far better than the stick.
1,This tablet was purchased for my son and was a great gift. Very kid friendly offering child safety options. Great price.
1,I bought two of these this year and I love my Fire TV it's very fast and fairly cheap the customer service was great when I bought my Fire TV. I can watch my Amazon Prime Hulu Netflix everything from one box. I will be purchasing one more cuz I love them so much specially when you stream using an ethernet cable which the best. This box is really fast it does not buffer
1,"Affordable, and it gets the job done. Not the most cutting-edge device, but nice nonetheless."
1,Cant believe a solid tablet for 34 buck. works great with amazon prime
1,I love this kindle for just relaxing and reading a book. It's easy on the eyes and easy to access your books.
1,Heard about the Echo and had seen it on tv. Absolutely love the product. Very fun.
1,"This is indeed a great product. Touch sensitivity and overall performance offcourse cannot beat other top brands, but it is with a very good price."
1,Great product compact easy to use fits right into the back of your TV. has a video tutorial that makes set up an installation very simple works great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a streaming device at a reasonable cost
1,Great product and easy to set up. I have recommended it to others that have seen it in action.
1,"I had an original version of these 5 years ago. I never used it then but have been reading more lately. I figured it was cheap enough lets give it a go- it has been amazing. I live in Hawaii so I bring it to the beach and read constantly. The back light it perfect for night reading. The only weird thing about this is that it saves all of your highlighted areas in one document, but it gives the full citation for each underlined part, which makes it extremely useful (if you read different books, but unnecessarily tedious. But either way, great feature."
1,This tablet is great. I purchased two for children at Christmas and they love it.
1,"affordable for the kids and quality is good not like other cheap tablet, amazon always make a good product."
1,"awesome little tablet with lots of functionality. my biggest complaint is the lack of power in the volume. besides that, there are too many apps on the home screen that gets in the way and looks cluttered. i have not found a simple way to remove them yet."
1,"Nothing like turning on your music, checking the local weather and traffic, getting world information and controlling the lights around your home all HANDS FREE!!! I purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day and I use it myself all the time! This is a Must Have..."
1,"it's got a few glitches in the system but overall, it's so great not having to deal with any cable company. I've got everything I need all in this neat little package."
1,The paper white can hold many books which is great for traveling. The back light is easy on the eyes.
1,"Replaced my Nexus Player with this. Much snappier and better network connections (mostly due to the wired ethernet). Have yet to try it on the 4K TV, but it's very easy to use and works well with Netflix and Plex."
1,I love the Amazon Echo. Can use it for a lot of stuff. Love it.
1,LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN
1,I purchased the tablet for my mother in law to use to read ebooks and play online games. It was very user friendly and a great price and product for our needs.
1,"These are great tablets for anyone wanting to get into the tablet game. A friendly UI for just about anyone. Not to mention, for the price and being able to add an SD card for additional memory, makes this a great tablet."
1,"This was a graduation gift to my son, who is going to the 6th grade! He loves it, and so do I! He had a Samsung galaxy Tab and he loves the speed of the Kindle tablet!"
1,"4K, quad core, 4GB ram, USB and MicroSD, voice remote...this box is a monster. Bonus if you are part of the Amazon Prime world...if not, still get one, it runs circles around AppleTV. Plus, these can be modded, if you are savvy enough."
1,We are enjoying our TV with the surround system. The picture is great as you can see detail's in people and back ground we didn't notices before. We need to get a new dish receiver to move the TV to its new location were we will be wireless.
0,This Tab is not for grown ups... neither for work nor for entertainment... the Amazon Fire OS has a long way to go..!!
1,This is the second one I have Purchased. I purchased the 16 MB version for less than 50.00. As long as you understand it is an Amazon product it a darn good Tablet for the money
1,"Alexa is amazing. Music is easy to get, either from Amazon or Pandora. Alexa easily understands commands. Wish others in my family responded as well as she does."
1,This product is easy to use and is better than any tv service u could get
1,This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
1,It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
1,A great e-reader have had no problems with it at all.
1,"Compared to previous generation kindle, this one is much user friendly and overall a good ereader."
1,Needed something smaller than a laptop to carry around. This is perfect.
1,This small tablet packs a lot of power. I can use it for many tasks including checking email and paying bills.
1,With the outdoor antenna and Fire stick - we were able to get rid of our Direct TV.
1,Loved it... great for streaming movies and tv shows. bought several of them for family and friends.
1,Great bargain for money. Easy to read in sunlight and while laying in bed.
1,Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.
0,"A reader, but the processor is not fast, react slowly"
1,"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out."
0,"Bought this an an auxiliary pad instead of a second iPad, which I have had for years. So, far, other than reading books on it I haven't been able to accomplish much. Most of the apps I use on my iPad don't have a compatible version. But, it was cheap, so even as just an e-reader I decided to keep it."
1,We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
1,Really like this tablet. It's easy to navigate and use.
1,"Tablet needs an extra storage card quickly if kids are downloading games, but otherwise it is a very good buy for kids that have never had a tablet before."
1,I love the kindle. My kids love playing their Disney movies on it. They also have a ton of games we downloaded for free. I highly recommend!
1,we love our fire tv. we highly recommend fire tv so much we cancelled our cable!
1,"The person I bought this for really loved the product, it was compact enough to carry to the beach, yet large enough to read from. The price when purchased was amazing and you can't beat it for speed and ease of using."
1,Love this amazon did a great job with design for it
1,"New to streaming tv, but Amazon offers many good channels and features. Easy to set up and use."
1,Good gift for my grandchild. She loves it. I'm a little unhappy with the navigation of the tablet from exiting a screen to return to the home screen. Especially when wanting to exit a game or video screen.
1,Love it. Purchased a second device for upstairs and downstairs. Good buy!
1,Bought this as a gift for my 7 year old niece and she loves it! It's entertaining and easy enough for her to navigate through!
1,I bought the tablet black Friday. Best buy had the same price as amazon. So I got it. The tablet was a gift for someone else. the recipient to this day insists that I should have gotten one for myself.
1,Nice tablets to take on the go!!! Also great for reading books.
0,"This is a competent tablet at a bargain price. Unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system. Amazon's take on Android essentially removes all functionality that makes Android great, to force you to use their services and apps INSTEAD of Google's.If you're a tinkerer or don't mind doing some software hacking, this is a pretty easy fix. You can hack Google's apps and services back into it, resulting in an amazing, and amazingly cheap Android tablet.Unless you're willing to do, or hire someone to do, those software modifications, you'll probably be disappointed. If you are, it'll be the best cheap tablet you'll ever own.It looks like it might be great for kids, even in its stock state. I don't have kids, so I could not test that. But I added a star for that possibility.Unmodified: 2 starsModified: 5 stars"
1,"This item is a deal at $49. Does everything you need for simple Internet browsing, email, social media and also takes great pictures!"
1,"Bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. She really enjoys it."
1,"I had one of the original Kindles and gave it to my daughter when I got an iPad. As much as I love my iPad, it's not ideal as an E-reader. After a trip or two this summer to the beach with a good old fashioned paperback, I figured I'd try out the New Kindle Paperwhite. I'm so glad I did! It is small, lightweight, and holds a charge for days! I love it, and have been reading book after book since my purchase."
1,Bought this for my son who enjoys watching videos and listening to music. Good quality tablet and good screen.
1,Purchased for 10 and 8 yr old for xmas. They loved them. Excellent price as well. PErfect for this age group without buying a child tablet
1,"Definitely has nice features, however, I prefer the navigation on the Apple TV."
1,"I purchased three of these. One as an upgrade to my old Kindle and two for Xmas gifts. The battery life seems short, but otherwise I have no issues. I used it primarily for reading on the train and browsing the internet."
0,volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
1,Needed to upgrade from the fire stick as it was too slow and dying from at least a years worth of being used
1,"I bought this for my Mom for Christmas, she is not tech savvy and she loves it and is able to slowly figure it out."
1,We really enjoy our Alexa. I always have it for music. Lately we been movie times. The kids like to ask it silly questions and they can't get enough of it
1,"Purchased for my 3yr old to play games and watch movies . Obviously with a little help, but the durability of this product is hands down great . It's not going to break that easy ! Plenty of memory and picture quality is good ."
1,Fantastic Excellent Purchase. Definitely buy another!
1,Bought the Kindle Fire for my granddaughter. She saw the one I purchased for another granddaughter and asked for one for her birthday. I like that it's much more than just a reader.
1,"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses."
1,Excellent TV box that brings you all the latest shows from Amazon and other venues..superfast with 4k
1,Bought for my granddaughter she loves it. She is starting her first series
1,"Love this product! I bought 1 about 6 weeks ago and quickly knew this was my favorite new ""gadget"". So when the discount was offered, I snatched up another one!"
1,Once the tap was able to be activated by voice I started to have some interest. Having said that I notice I do use the 'Tap' button when I have it in my hand. We use it mostly outside and by our hot tub. Took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point.
1,"I like this tablet, great features and functionality for a good price."
1,This is some advanced ass technology.
1,"My wife was using her iPhone 6 Plus for reading at night, but she is absolutely loving the Kindle Paperwhite!!"
1,Got for my grand sons for Christmas and they had a blast. Uploaded favorite games and loloaded music.
1,Great price works great I have no complaints about the product I would recommend to any one that loves kindle
1,See above review summary Bought for my Grandkids and they love watching TV on it learning how to use. You should see their faces when the TV came on with Mickey on it.
1,My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they're a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!!
0,"I didn't expect a lot at this price, but I also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with dead/stuck pixels right out of the box. I have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that I am at least good for 1/3. Waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for return/replacement just in case that one needs to go as well. Maybe just bad luck, but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a return.Everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues, but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been corrected.I am sure if you don't have these display issues that the product deserves more than 2 stars, but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being. If the display did not have these pixel issues I could see this easily being a 4 Star recommendation. If you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others, so this is not just a rare incident. If it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location, do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home. :)"
1,"I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.."
1,Purchased this tablet for a 9 yr old and it's perfect. Easy to use and very durable. He is very happy.
1,"Gave it as a gift, and they loved it. It's perfect for anyone"
1,"The functionality of the speaker is great, sound is good."
0,This table is realy nice for starters. This table have lots off free apps. It's easy to use and u can put in an sd card for more space.
1,Love it! And I don't even know all the bells and whistles yet! Would definitely recommend!! Learn something new about it every day!
1,So much fun but still have a lot to learn about Alexa. A friend of mine loved it so much she also bought one .
1,Love my echo and so does my 9yr old! He has more experience with it lol but the volume has so much clarity and Alexa understands everything you say
1,Best buy had this product when no one else did. Ok
1,Great product especially for the price! It exceeds my expectations and then some.
1,"I like the tablet for basic use, but definitely enough for any kid"
1,I am no longer sitting alone in the basement watching Netflix using the kid's Xbox connection. I can watch Netflix upstairs and still remain somewhat involved in what the rest of the family is doing!
1,"My family and i love it,its now a member of our family."
0,"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
1,"Simple, easy to use. Keep all the tv apps in one place"
1,Alexa is phenomenal. Intuitive and witty. A must have.
1,Super fast response. Cool remote. Great menus and navigation
1,"I was hesitant to buy, thinking the tablet would not be very good, but for the price of $49.99, it's been great for my teenage niece. She uses it to watch movies, FB, You Tube, and web."
1,Bought this for a 5 yr old to showcase all her photos. She loves it
0,The fire is a good product for its price. We bought it for travel and it worked like we wanted it to. The volume was lacking though. Trying to listen to a movie an the plane was very difficult.
1,excedes my expections is easy to use and Amazon sends me e-mails keeping me informed of things that Echo can do which i find very helpful
1,Purchased it to watch/stream movies and tv shows on Amazon. Wish I would had bought the 4K fire stick. This is still a good stick!
1,Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
1,Great price for the product you receive. Great way to cut cable bill.
1,"The Echo hub is slick and very easy to set up. The built in mic and speaker are very good. Alexa voice service is totally awesome! A nice perk is that you have access to over a million songs if you are an Amazon Prime member, otherwise you can use any of the other popular music apps."
1,Would buy again. First tablet. Having the time of my life with it.
1,"Great Xmas gift, every one loved it. It came within 2 days of ordering.. I should have ordered one for myself."
1,Great product. Easy to read on without feeling like you're staring at a computer screen. No glare at all no matter where I am. Very easy to hold whether reading sitting or laying down. Highly recommended!
1,"Light weight, adjustable brightness, no glare, long battery life.This is a great way to read a book!"
1,Good tablet for kids. Can use for gaming and school work
1,Overall - good quality for the cost. Ease of use; functionality is beneficial and allows for great entertainment.
1,Ordered a white Echo. Made a great house warming gift.
1,I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
1,I love Amazon Echo with Alexa. It can answer any question. The only downside is that it cannot play ITunes music. I'm hoping Amazon will change that in the near future.
1,great price and great birthday gift for my son.no complaints so far. my son & his sister enjoy playing games and watching videos.
1,Best tablet on the market for the price without a doubt
1,This is really an awesome and useful gadget. Even our four-year-old has learned how to use it effectively. And each week I get an email describing new apps and benefits on it. I can't wait to see what comes out next week.
1,This is one of the best box out there in the market. I purchase many different boxes but this is far suppirior quality then others. Good value for the money. Only complain about price should be more compitetive otherwise you will not be disappointed.
0,"My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me."
1,"This is the 3rd Kindle we have purchased and they keep getting a little nicer with each version. The light on this one is a really nice feature. The battery life is better, the page turning options are better, it is lighter... there are just a lot of nice little improvements. If you like to read in an electronic format I cannot imagine disliking the Kindle."
1,It's the best and closest you will get to a book but I still miss that feel of holding a book.
1,"Build quality-- very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling."
1,"Kindle paper white is a fantastic e-reader. It has great contrast, is easy on the eyes, and the backlight is just right for reading in darker environments."
1,"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc."
1,Thanks for making the purchase easy The product is good
1,This is my second one because my first froze up and stopped working.
1,Great price for the tablet. My granddaughters love it.
1,Great price! Got it for my kid for Christmas. He loves it! He plays games on it and streams Netflix with ease!
1,"The Fire Tv is fast and reliable. With the ease of setup and expandability of this product, it's a no brainer BUY!"
1,"G'kids came over early for Christmas, ages 7 and 10. They opened basketball hoop and backboard, a camera, Lego toys BUT they went ""CRAZY"" when they opened the ""FIRE"" tablets. By the time they went home they had already downloaded game apps to play. Thanks for a great Christmas ..."
1,Alexa is a great gadget. She is fun and can be very helpful. A great companion
1,can't beat the price on this great starter tablet. purchase this as a gift. many happy hours of use by recipient.
0,This Tablet anonymous me so much simple apps like You Tube are a hassle to get and unless you know about .apk you are lost. Great for readers and simple web surfing. I do like the free games from underground. My unit arrived damage. Amazon replacing let's see how that goes.
1,"All I have to do is speak, and I have music and news. It keeps me company."
1,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music
1,Android unfortunately always is buggy and whether its nexus or amazon they have the task of cleaning up the bugs and unlike some people I am not complaining. The bugs will be fixed soon just like the first one. Anyways...this device is giving more everything at the same price. Thanks Amazon
1,"Picked this up for only $35 during BF sale. Functions smoothly and I can't find any other knock off tablets in this price range that is as smooth. Bought this for my 7 yr old to play games, stream media and such. It gives me relief that I won't be losing hundreds of dollars if she breaks it. It is cheap enough to replace if it happens."
1,"Bought this Tablet around Christmas Holiday, easy set-up, download apps, & can download e-books, great for under $100. Highly recommend to pick this up!"
1,"Got this for my 15 year old who swore she wouldn't use any tablet. To her suprise not mine she loves it. She can listen to music, watch videos, and play games any where in the house. I got this on Black Friday for $35 so it was practically free but even at the full price of $50 it is well below the average price of all knock off tablets."
1,I like the new kindle I purchased. I like the home screen better than older versions.
1,I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
1,"I got in on the initial deal with DirecTV Now and after the frustration of dealing with the Apple TV I received for free with the service, I tried this box. What a difference. It streams 4K (yes I have a 4K TV) and performs everything fast. It also has all of the services I use. Forget the Apple junk and pick this up!"
1,Overall this tablet is great. Feels great in your hand(s). In my opinion it'd be great for a light user or a child.
1,These amazon kindle started off great and are only getting better. I really enjoy all the new features the new ones have.
1,"Good for reading!Price ($90) is good, e-ink is good for reading."
1,Easy setup with android. I have Amazon prime. Great with music.
1,"My husband got one for his birthday and I'm the one that uses it the most, I have it paired to my spotify and I just ask Alexa for a song and she plays it for me. I get daily news, weather and I can shop on Amazon. Its awesome"
1,"Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet."
1,"I bought 2, hardest part was going from iOS to learning to use the kindle fire. My daughter and brother love it!"
1,my son loves it and is easy to use and has parental controls so he can't buy stuff without permission
1,"Excellent bargain for the price. Very compact, will fit nicely in a purse. Lot of storage capacity...can carry a small.library and give you notebook features with all the bells and whistles of a Kindle. If you're a reader on the go this is a great buy!"
1,"I love Alexa, Great way to search. Home screen is organized well lots of options but more with Amazon prime. Spend the money if your prime member."
1,"I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out."
1,This was one of my best purchases hundreds of great movies and shows available.
1,"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!"
0,"This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed."
1,This thing is pretty freakin cool. It's a gadget but a useful one. It's literally Siri for the house. Ask it anything and get the answer or just listen to any type of music in great sound quality. Awesome little thing.
1,"She loves it, its her first tablet experience and tells me all the time how much she enjoys using it. She couldn't be happier."
1,Has great abilty to perform at high levels e as sy to operate . Very simple technology
1,Son loves this tablet kid friendly tons of games very pleased
0,Very easy to setup up and can be used to automate home using smart skills. I use to control hue lighting and nest products. Only complaint is she is not as smart as they say. Constant updates are making her better but lacking a lot of information when asked. Emails are sent with update info. 90 percent on voice commands. Wish it came with optional remote for when you are out of range of voice
1,Bought for my grandson and the programs that were included with the device give a wide variety of education tools
1,Great tablet with reasonable price. Best one from amazon
1,Enjoy all the features of the tablets from gaming to pictures. Battery life is good as well
1,My daughter can never put her fire tablet down she really loves it
1,Paper white is worth every penny! I was upgrading from the regular kindle to this and noticed that my eyes are more relaxed...
1,"""An inexpensive 'Tablet""' was the request on the Angel Tree at my son's middle school and we didn't even have to think twice about it. Unfortunately we get no feedback on the performance of these gifts but we hope and pray that it brings some happiness to the recipient. God Bless Us everyone!"
1,Got this to replace a fire stick. It stands without buffering and I love the voice remote.
1,This works as described and Am very happy with it.
1,"wanted to bring computer life to big screen. don't have smart tv, so this was perfect"
1,This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well.
0,Returned it.. didn't work like we thought it was so supposed to. Pain on the butt.
1,Love my Echo! Still learning what I can and can't do. Was surprised to get a message from two friends the other night on Alexa!
1,I wish it were a little bit bigger but it's just right for what I need. It's light weight and compact. Very easy to use and priced very reasonably!
1,"Echo is awesome. A talking computer of information, music, knowledge of light bulb apps, furnace apps. garage door app. Simply amazing. Give yourself a gift you will love ""Echo"""
1,"Simple to set up. My husband isn't tech-savvy, and this was easy for him to set up."
1,"Easy to use as it is intuitive. Love the Alexa remote. You can just say ""Alexa Tom Hanks""and it will pull up all the Tim Hanks movies available."
1,"I LOVE THE AMAZON TV, THEY SHOULD CALL IT THE AMAZING TV BOX!!!"
1,"Top movies, anytime, just your choice. Old movies!"
1,"Love Alexia, answers questions and plays music that I don't have to pay for"
1,I love it it was a good investment but hard to set up.
1,So far it has done exactly what I want it to do. It is much faster than the fire stick
1,"I never had a legitimate reason for owning a tablet. I prefer watching shows and movies on my TV and I prefer reading actual books as opposed to a tablet. However, when I learned that Best Buy was selling this Amazon tablet for $34.99 on Black Friday, I knew that I had to get my hands on one. Even with the aforementioned reasons for not getting one, I couldn't argue with that price. I think it's a great starter tablet. It may not have the largest screen or HD quality but then again I don't need all of that. The quality and size of the screen are perfect for that price. 8GB may not be a lot of memory but there is also an option to get more storage via a memory card. I very much satisfied and recommend this tablet to anybody, especially those who are curious about tablets and haven't purchased on yet."
1,Never thought I could give up a real book! The lightweight easy reading on the beach does it! I'm a believer
1,"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
1,"We bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. The kids love it and it is simple to use. The ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. We can switch to our profile to watch Netflix or use other apps if we want. Comes with a great warranty and device protector. We're very happy with the Amazon Fire Tablet."
0,Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
1,Nice tablet will seriously think about getting a second one.
1,"I already had purchased a Fire Stick, because I am a gadget nut and, well, reasons... *heh*. I decided to move up as part of a cord cutting drive, and this unit really shines. With more compute power and buffering space, it does a really nice job, even on fast moving source material. I also like the voice input."
1,"Amazon - Echo is a great device to use at home, it helps my kids in their home-work. I am enjoying it, some day I am planning to do some automation of light with that."
1,I ordered the extra case not knowing the device came with a case.
0,Honestly the worst tablet ever owned. Was very slow and unreliable would switch off
0,"Everyone knows ""kindle fire"". When these went on sale I grabbed a few up to use as kiosks for our PTA. Little did I know that fires run a ""special"" operating system, not a standard android. The 2 apps I needed to run were not available on kindle store. After much research I found a work around but it was very frustrating."
1,"Great tablet for all ages, easy to navigate, charges fast. Great resolution"
1,My son loves this tablet!! He's 13 yrs old and this thing does everything. Great battery life also
1,Awesome! My cousin had one and I loved it So much that I bought one for my husband and sister. Good features and easy to use
1,"Much faster than the stick in every way (wifi, processor, and ram). I like this a lot more than the stick it's just snappier.The voice remote is useless. I still prefer the Apple TV 4, over AFTV."
1,Store employees were very helpful. They had enough knowledge to help me select a great tablet.
1,Loved the Amazon tablets. Able to take anywhere and it fits in most bags. Can play any games and able to use social media website with ease.
1,Well received as it was given as a gift to a person who likes technology
1,"We have the echo in our kitchen, it is so handy to ask Alexa to play music, set timers, the news, weather etc"
1,"I love the kindle, although do then to drop them. Always get the insurance and best buy makes it easy to replace them"
1,Very good buy going to purchase one for all the family members.
1,"I love the amazon echo! You just talk to it and ask it questions. It plays any song you would like to hear, checks the weather, creates to do lists, orders things off amazon, checks traffic, looks anything up off the internet. I love it! We have 3 in the house now!"
1,Awesome device! Using it to cut the cord and it works great
1,"The Fire works better than I expected. For a $50 tablet, I have to imagine it's the best on the market. Good battery life, fast response and loading times, nice display. The only problem I've had so far is that I have to restart it if I let it sit for over an hour before it will handle a wifi signal."
1,The Fire is a great tablet for beginners. It is easy to use and it works perfect for me.
1,I really enjoy the versatility the Alexa is. It has so many posibilities.
1,"This was a gift, actually bought 2 of these for the grandkids and they love them. Easy to set up and get going-they are solid and well made. Very pleased with this purchase."
1,Got this as a gift for my mother. It is a great little starter tablet for anyone wanting to surf the web or play some games. I also like it because it is small and portable.
1,Cheap an easy to use for my 6 year old sun to play. Easy navigation lots of games to choose from along with apps.
1,"This has been a fun and intuitive way to play music, get the weather report, find out game scores, etc. I'm looking forward to integrating it into my house with lighting and temperature control. The speaker sound quality is excellent for such a small machine."
1,Very impressed with this tablet. I usually only purchase Samsung products but I needed something affordable for my children that wasn't terrible like the other knock off brands. This tablet is fast. Needs me memory but it is perfect for my kids. I bought 4!!!
1,"We've had so much fun with this thing, we just love it!"
1,Well worth the money. It does everything it say it will do and more.
1,"Use it every night to watch amazon television in bed, play games, read books. Great item."
1,the amazon fire tablet is a fantastic deal for the price. the amazon app store is great and this tablet has speed and a great screen for the price point you can't go wrong
1,"Does everything that are claimed, the speaker system is wonderful."
1,Great little tablet. Price was great! Can do almost anything on it just like an ipad but cheaper!
1,"Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
1,Kindle is just like a real paper book. It also save my book spaces and easy to organize.
1,This is great for reading books or letting your kids play games and keep them off your phone.
1,Brought it for my husband and he absolutely loves it
1,Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.
1,"Got this for my children and grandchildren to give my mom. She thinks she needs an electronic device like all the kids have, so this was perfect. She can play games and have email and the kids help her with books and videos. Perfect for grandma"
1,"Great interface, 4K and below output. It is well worth the money! Has a multitude of well made apps, and is a well designed unit. Easily upgrade able via a micro SD card!"
1,Easy for 3 year old to navigate. Like the adult to kid use.
1,"Easy to use, does great job of adjusting the background light for reading. Takes a little adjustment from my old keyboard kindle, but not a problem."
1,"The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
1,Product does not disappoint. It does what it says.
1,"Alexa is fun and witty and. Very convenient,, especially when I need a timer when cooking."
1,This item is perfect for my son. Now he has his own game system no more low battery for my phone. Price is the best part you can't go wrong with this choice . I am very satisfied .
1,I love it!! I would buy this again! Not enuf space
1,"My previous generation Kindle Paperwhite got scratched a little on the screen, so I debated about picking up a new Kindle, but it was worth the $120. The 7th generation Paperwhite has twice the memory, runs a bit faster so it's noticeably quicker in response--making highlighting and annotating easier, and the uneven screen lighting problem (the older Kindle had ""shadow"" spots on the bottom edge of the screen) has been solved.My only complaint is that Amazon continues to put ads on the Kindle, which you have to pay $20 to get rid of. It's almost necessary because I use the Kindle to view books in church. Very inappropriate when the ad for a murder, crime, or romance novel pops up as a screensaver."
1,"A lot faster than Siri, very responsive and helpful in the kitchen playing music Multiple timers and measurements"
1,I like the ease of this electronic. She helps me everyday
1,"Great for kids or adults. Can't beat the price for what this tablet can do. Just as good as the more expensive tables, just need to buy extra memory"
1,"Much better than reading on my iPad, especially outdoors and at night. Portable size, great battery life, and must have for any serious reader"
1,This is my first kindle and I have been very pleased with it for what I payed for it.
1,The Alexa is awesome! It's nice to be able to tell her what I need at the store and it goes to my app on my phone.
1,I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
1,The product came as described and has been working great
1,We have it set up in the kitchen. Mainly use it to play music and give us the weather forecast. She really is amaxing at answering general questions
1,Exactly what was expected. Ease of setup is a definite plus and you can't beat the price for a streaming device.
1,"Works amazing and offers a lot of apps, games and music."
1,I have always had a kindle fire but I had one that was just overloaded with books and so I bought a new one with more memory. It is awesome and so fast. But also the battery charges very fast and hold a charge for a very long time.
1,I'm very with this kids friendly tablet. My daughter she uses my iPad and I decided to look one perfect for her...two years warrantee.
1,"This tablet is limited in functionality but it gets the job done, especially for the price"
1,"Already had one Alexa. Went and bought another and a couple of dots. Now we can ""drop-in"" to different rooms."
1,I loved that the kids enjoyed it and I would be getting another one
1,My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
1,I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8. It has everything you need and more and so much less expensive.
1,For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn't buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself.
1,Yes I did it. Got me Alexa. Best thing ever. Nice to get music.
1,It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.
0,"OK, I bought this with high expectations after watching the commercials. I thought it's going to be better than Siri, but no. It can react or answer some of your calls very well, but it's very limited. Now I use it to play prime musics only."
1,Thought it would be fun to have one after reading the reviews. My alarm clock went south and I was shopping for a new one. Echo is a GR8 alarm clock GR8 timer + all the other amazing things it can do. It's just fun!! I have 2 Echos and 1 Echo Dot when I say play everywhere the whole house is full of music of my choice!
1,"This is a great inexpensive disposable tablet. It does run on Amazon's Fire OS which is based on android and designed for Amazon's app store. Technically you can side load it with other Android apps to get around some of the restrictions/limitations should you desire. If you are a big Amazon Prime fan (often using Amazon video/music, doing Amazon shopping), or need an inexpensive yet still very functional tablet then just get it. For the price, you can't beat it. If you are expecting a big major functioning tablet that uses the Google Play store or is comparable to an Apple iPad that is 6x the price, then this is not for you but you won't find that in this price range."
1,I cannot wait to link my house to this device. I'm only using the factory settings and am thoroughly impressed.
1,Nice
0,"The Kindle is a great tablet for minor tasks and games or for a child. I haven't had it long, but I'm able to use it for what I bought it for, e-books for school."
1,A fast and good quality tablet for the money that you spend.
1,pros - light compact bright fast response from touch screencons- hard to navigate. I use my old kindle with buttons to browse. This kindle can be frustratingwith its overly sensitive touch screen.Overall a very good reader but no need to purchase if happy with paperwhite versions. For someone new to kindle it is worth the price as long as have another electronic device to browse the kindle site.
1,"I really like the fire tv box. This was recommended to me by an Amazon sales rep stocking the store. My favorite part about it is that it plays 4K uhd video! Very fast and smooth, and actually takes advantage of the AC side of these new routers! Much better than using the apps built in to the tv!"
1,"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
1,Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each
1,The fire tv is worth every penny. I have not had any issues with my device
1,"I have both Google Home and Amazon Echo. I also have a Harmony Hub and several smart home devices. I love the smart home integration and once you activate lights and your entertainment center with your voice, good luck going back. For now, the Echo has better integration with my smart home, but once Google Home catches up, I will be switching to Google for the sole reason I subscribe to Google Play Music.But to be honest all of these devices have limited uses and the ""fun"" or ""cool"" appeal wears off soon. It's fun to ask Alexa questions or ask her to tell you a joke, but that gets old quick. It's also cool to order something from Amazon, but I rarely do so because I like to look at what I'm ordering. The sound quality is passable for a small speaker. I prefer to send music to my receiver through other means (i.e. Google Home and Chromecast Audio). At the end of the day, it's a fun device to have that provides some useful ""skills"" (ordering Dominos is cool, but I've only done it once) and games (I like Jeopardy) but it's true usefulness is its ability to be the voice hub for your smart home, if you're interested in having one..."
1,Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
1,"I love controlling my Phillips Hue lighting, and the music on demand is awsome."
1,The adjustable backlighting is perfect for reading in any light or no light at all reducing eye strain.
1,"This is my second unit, this one is 1080p with 4k ultra high definition built in and I love it, if you buy one, you will also love it."
1,A gift for my grandsons. They love it! Easy to use
1,was a great buy for my mom. would recommend to anyone who read a lot of paper backs.
1,The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
1,Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
1,Great item for my kids are you recommend it to anyone that wants to replace an iPad for their kids
1,"I bought this tablet so I had a smaller tablet to take places, I absolutely love it!"
1,"So far the echo has been great...but there is a limited amount of skill and a lot of them are very useless. Once I add the accessories tonmake my home ""smarter"" I can get more use out of it. The speakers are incredible. Hope to have one or a dot in more rooms."
1,"My son's previous Kindle Fire HDX 6 broke and I needed an inexpensive replacement. This Kindle Fire HD 7 was a great replacement for only $50.00. Great resolution, perfect size for a 10 year old boy."
1,This is a great simple tablet for the price. Can't go wrong. Bought two of these for my teen daughters. Love the fact that I can easily restrict what they are able to view and download.
0,"Slow, advertisement plagued. Save and spend money on something better."
1,"I have been researching the different Kindles, and decided on this one. I think I made a great choice."
1,easy on the eyes and no trouble to use. had a little trouble setting up but once we did there has been no issues. great for traveling or curling up in your favourite chair
1,Works great for watching tv shows. Plugged right in. Easy to use.
1,"This device, which has the latest version of artificial intelligence, is the smartest one I've seen yet. While security questions are a hot topic, I have learned how to mute the device when necessary. Don't let that stop you from having the best multi-use device on the market. Did I mention it has a great wireless speaker too?"
1,"The better choice from the others, especially if you are a Prime member. Easy to set up and to use. Voice remote and now with Alexa built in, the better choice"
1,"For under fifty dollars this little , durable , expandable tablet can't be beat!!!"
1,Got this for my dad who is not good with electronics. It's so easy to use he is already on Netflix!
1,My computer crashed and I bought this tablet to get me by during repairs. The tablet allowed me to keep up with my e-mails and events. I used it to surf the internet as well. It will be used for similar purposes when my wife and I go on a three week road trip in the near future. A very compact and versatile unit.
1,"I've had my echo since the initial launch date and I love it more and more. Alexa does everything and she learns more and more every month. She controls my home (lights, thermostat and garage door) and with IFTTT she can do things like call my phone or email my shopping list (you can create your own triggers) Her possibilities are endless. She's also a very handy alarm... she wakes me up and when I saw goodbye she turns off the lights and turns down the thermos."
1,"Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games."
1,I loved the movies and the tabletPerfect for my purposes. Jbl wireless were greatFor music but wereLacking for phone use.
1,The echo was easy to set up and works as it should. It is useful when you have a question just ask and it will normally answer you . My 9 year old uses it for math homework
1,Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
1,No buffer issues and fast. Comes loaded with apps. Basically plug in and use.
1,This tablet uses the Amazon version of the Android operating system. Not all apps and functions are available for use on this device. Tablet is reasonably fast and responsive. Screen is sharp and bright with a wide viewing angle. Speaker is minimal and lacks fidelity - external bluetooth speaker (not included) or hard wired audio system(not included) work well . Bluetooth works well. WiFi (N) works well. Both cameras are weak and grainy. Check to make sure the apps you want to use are available and also check to make sure they work well.
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is my first ereader and I love it. It works as advertised and is very easy to navigate. I haven't tried it in bright sunlight yet but have had no difficulty seeing the screen in all other situations. It is lightweight and easy to hold. I have a cover on it which I find increases the grip.
1,Easy to install. Easy set up. Would recommend to friends.
1,"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
0,"It's technically sound, but not extremely useful. Perhaps future updates will make it more useful."
1,"Fun item that actually helps, hands free around the house"
1,"Amazon Echo is i great device to assist in home automation. I use it to turn on lights, arm my security camera and set thermostats. Also great with Amazon Prime for music."
1,"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
1,this is a great product with several streaming options.
1,I liked the ease of use and how quickly we could get it set up and is great for kids to use as well
0,"I purchase a fire after my nook died. I had problems with the first one saying I was connected to the web , but not being able to connect. Took it back and the geek squad looked at it and after trouble shooting for a while, they decided there was something wrong with it, so I exchanged it for another one. We set it up and it worked initially, then I went home and the same thing happened as with tg first one. So I took it back and got my full refund . While not happy with product, best buy customer service made me happy."
1,Got this as a gift for my bookworm wife and she loves it. Typically she likes physical copies but the kindle is a space saver
1,we get what we paid for but at $49 this machine is much better than any of the cheap tabs that are in market. the screen resolution and the performance is pretty decent for this grade of tablet.
1,i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading
1,Great product for a great price. Can't get any better.
1,"She's fantastic! Love that we can get the weather, play music and play jeopardy!"
1,"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
1,Enjoying my Alexa very much. A very cool idea that works
1,my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
1,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet."
1,I can get rid of the old stereo/radio in my family room. I use it all the time.
1,I would recommend this product to anyone that loves reading e-books.
1,They've done a great job with the voice recognition and it works with so many different services and has so many capabilities. Loving Alexa
1,"I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet."
1,Charger has worked well for charging my Voyage. Comes as a separate purchase from the Voyage which I found. Think it should be bundledwith the purchase price of the Kindle Voyage.
1,"I am still learning how to using it. I use it for Facebook, e-mails,play games on Facebook, eventually I want to be able to use the camera which I haven' t figured out yet. Once do I will be doing a lot of picture taking!☺"
1,For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.
1,"As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last. Ive never had one break as other brands do, I just keep leaving them in random hotels and airports while traveling and have to buy another! If you are looking for a solid and longer-lasting charger for your tablet, I would recommend this one."
1,It's a bit smaller than my original. Backlight makes it simple to see ANYWHERE. Wish there was another option other than touch.
1,My son loves his Amazon Echo. It is a cool gadget to have.
1,I shop on amazon and watch Amazon shows. Does great for what I wanted it for.
1,"Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media."
0,feel it should have come with paperwhite kindle and that I should not have had to buy it
1,"I bought this for my wife's birthday, she uses it all the time, she looks up recipes, used Alexa to set timers hands free, checks weather and news she is finding new uses every day."
1,"I had bought a Nabi for my granddaughter and she finally broke it. Out of warranty, I just fugured I'd purchase another one since she is familiar with it. After reading reviews, decided kids are pretty sharp and can pick up new things quickly ( she's 4!). She had no trouble with it at all and my daughter says she loves it! So far no complaints from a technical standpoint."
0,It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together.
1,I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
1,"I wish I purchased the warranty, this kindle is glitchy and pixelly (if that's even a term) and also freezes"
1,The fire TV is a nice upgrade if you have the fire stick. Its fast and has expandable storage. Best for TVs with high resolution.
1,I can watch tons of stuff in my TV who needs cable now days
1,I bought this for my grandma so she could use it in church to read the Bible. She loves it!
1,This is the 4th one I have bought 3 for my kids and 1 for my 1 wife. They all love them they are perfect and for a amazing price.
1,"Fast interface, great for people with prime membership. voice search working well. It would have been nicer if the menu is flexible we can see third party apps along with the apps installed from amazon store."
1,Love this ereader; very convenient. Very easy to use.
1,This is terrific. What a joy. Easy to install. Easy to use.
1,My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
1,"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
1,Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
1,Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.
1,I chose this product from my daughter's this is a great product keeps them from fighting and misbehaving. I think everyone should have one for their child this is a great product to help them learn and really affordable the people at Best Buy were really helpful.
1,I like this speaker.great product from Amazon.all what I need
1,Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
1,Easy installation and usage. With the Fire Stick I don't have cable bills any longer.
1,"The Kindle Voyage 6 is better than the real thing. After wearing out a first generation Kindle in our home, we knew we wanted something with versatility of the original with a few added features. The background light is a big plus as it allows my wife to read at night without having to keep the lights on. It's a great ereader at the right price."
1,I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
1,"Works good, easy to install and would definitely recommend"
1,Every morning I ask Alexa about weather updatesShe has not failed me yetLove my purchase
1,This is a good tablet. The only thing that would make it better is it being HD.
1,Affordable introduction to data centered assistance. Does pull you more deeply into the Amazon ecosystem.
1,"I have to admit that I am very pleased with my Echo. It was easy to connect to my Amazon Prime account so we have been enjoying music around the kitchen. It is amazingly easy to use. The speaker is great and we are finding it much more than the gimmick I thought it would be. We have enjoyed it so much that we added two Dots, one for each floor."
1,Accomplishes the tasks of a bigger tablet at a much lower price.
1,Very satisfy with this device. It does everything that I want it to do.
0,Good product for $50. External SD card is nice option.
1,"This is a great product, works with my Hue lighting products and Ecobee3 thermostat. It is fun and the sound reproduction is good considering the size of the speaker. I would buy the product again if I had the need."
1,I bought this tablet mostly because the price was extremely affordable. I like that it's easy to use and set up easily to my Amazon account and all my books.
1,Great for use with the family and it's hard to figure out everything it does!
1,"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no ""accidental"" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts."
0,This device is OK for reading or listening to audiobooks via Overdrive app. Wouldn't recommend it though really. Waited to buy Kindle for years. Would suggest doing research before buying this device.
1,This was just the right size for travel and there is no glare. I especially like the dictionary feature.
1,This a great tablet for kids ...my twins had them last year but one of them broke because my daughter dropped it...so she is requesting another one for Christmas ...it serves its purpose for the price
1,"This product requires significantly less buffering than the fire stick.For sure would recommend over the Fire Stick if you are planning on using this for streaming, especially for movies or live TV.This product also incorporates Alexa so you can control your smart home from the comfort of your couch."
1,"Great for books, netflix, or social media. Real handy!"
1,Gift for my husband who hates reading on the iPad. He loves this so much better!
1,Love using my Kindle Paperwhite. The best feature is the ability to adjust the backlight when reading in different locations.
1,This gift was given to a relative who is hospitalized for an indefinite period of time. Perfect way to stay connected; great alternative to purchasing hard copy books.
1,"I bought 4 already and So far my cousins love it. Still working great, easy to use, great size for kids."
1,great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!
1,"Your music, Pandora, etc, alarms, weather.. The entire family loves the echo and its various uses. Easy to set up and start using."
1,"Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves Alexa and speaks to her daily. Can't imagine how he survived without the Flash Briefing or Sports update. The Echo speaker is not as good as our Sonos, but it is great to get the weather or set a timer without touching a device."
1,"This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!"
1,"I love it, use it just about everyday! Wasn't sure if I would like it and use it that much but find I do."
0,Bought this for my 82 year old dad. It was to complicated for him to use. I couldn't figure enough of it out to be able to explain it all to him in the time I was visiting him. Returned and bought a different kind.
1,"Streaming box that does the job, I can access My Prime videos and other streaming apps, good device for a good price, worth the money."
1,Love my kindle sleek and easy to use! Love that I can control the brightness of the backlight
1,quick shipping great price..... great product..... all great... very happy with the kindle....
1,This device meet my expectations. Fully recommended.
0,"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad."
1,My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.
1,This is by far the best thing I could have bought.
1,Same content but better. I wanted another one for my other tv.
0,Does not have answers for a lot of questions. But is fun to have
1,Love the box and the stick both. They are easy to use as well.
1,Great box better than the firestick and other boxes
0,"You have to pay for every thing -any thing you want to do --you do not pay for the tempter, time and joked. You owe your money to amazon. A unique toy for the rich. What a bargain???????"
1,"Love being able to access all the apps we stream from. Like the voice remote, can be a real time saver especially when you can't remember which app the show you want top watch is on."
1,Incredible download speed bigger remote super responsive in selection Increased wifi range better bandwidth Definitely would recommend if you are in the market to buy a streaming media device
1,I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you
1,I have about every single streaming player on the market. This one is not better or worse than the others. I got it only for using 3rd party apps. For that it works flawlessly! If you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill.
1,"Perfect device for making music, weather, scheduling all easier day to day"
1,"This is a nice little unit! Very portable and easy to read, or watch movies except in bright sunlight, it is easy to change the tablet light to not bother others in low light conditions"
1,Great e reader! Would recommend this over the other kindles.
1,"I bought this to take on vacation and I love it! I use it to read ebooks, watch Netflix, check my email. Definitely gets the job done."
0,I didn't see that much of an improvement from the fire stick so I don't think it worth the extra cash. Decided to go with fire stick to save a bit.
1,This is such an awesome product… I highly recommend it – very easy to use and capable of so much!
1,Paid $35 on sale. This tablet offers great capability for most people. Very good item for Amazon Prime members. Not the greatest specs but works fine. The ads aren't too annoying. The micro-SD slot allows you to put lots of music/video on this unit.
1,this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon
1,"Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?"
1,Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it.
1,This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
1,"These make great gifts. It encourages reading, and the camera is a great addition."
1,I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
1,The Amazon Echo is a great product. It was easy to set up. The speaker produces excellent sound.
1,She is great at controlling hue lights and harmony hub. Voice command smar home!
1,just what i expected and just what I wanted. thanks.
1,Sounds amazing and very responsive to questions and orders
1,This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. I received this generation to replace my older generation. The screen is even clearer than the previous version. Previous version still worked perfectly. Paperwhite is so easy to read and the backlight is great for bedtime reading.
1,Bought for my grandson for Christmas. He loves it so much.
1,A good product that provides the services I desire.
1,"The Fire TV is much faster than the Fire Stick. It's super-compact. It has a better antenna, so it can pick up the wifi signal from farther away than the fire stick. It also supports 4K streaming and has more memory than the fire stick (this means gaming capability). The only downsides are: you must sign in/create an Amazon account (which is free), it doesn't come with an HDMI cord (which is required for use), and it doesn't have expandable memory. Overall, it is well worth the price and I would suggest spending the extra $60 and purchasing the Fire TV instead of the Fire Stick."
1,Our family streams movies and tv from amazon and direct tv now and this is great
1,Cut the cord with DirecTV and so happy that I did. Lots of content to watch and crystal clear. Quality Streaming & Sound. Thanks Bezos.
1,I purchased my mom one once I got mine. I also convinced my uncle to buy his wife one. That's how much I love the Echo
1,This a great upgrade fir me. Just replaced the fire stick and difference is huge.I love it
1,Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :)
1,My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life
1,"Value, Performance, ease of use, lightweight, what more could you want."
1,Just as you would expect it sounds great and works.
1,"These things are the perfect box for streaming shows, with a voice activating remote."
0,"Got both Echo and Dot. About 5 times a day I loose connectivity. Worked with tech support 3 times. Now, they suggest I have to adjust Motorola router settings to make the router compatible. More time!."
1,"It is basically what you want in a tablet. It has everything, just buying the ads to go away was a bummer."
1,"I bought this product for my son to use for school, its easy and battery is really good! He loves it"
1,So far the best streaming box out there you can easily download third party apps and run Kodi etc... Can't beat it
1,Fun to sit around and ask Alexia questions and getting her responses
1,Good for beginners. Small for little hands. My 9 year old son loves it. He can read books on it. The video quality is great.
1,I'm having so much fun with Alexa no glitches so easy to work
1,When I purchased my device and synced it. I was excited until my voice commands were not detected. One I pronounced Alexa name right (LOL) the she woke-up. The more I used commands with Alexa the easier it became. I am so happy about the purchase. This was a GREAT gift to me!
1,"Works well, especially when its given for a gift for someone for the holidays."
1,It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
1,"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this."
1,The price is outstanding it works great for my use surfing the web. Little slow and the image is not super sharp but you can't beat the price. if you're looking for an inexpensive tablet this one is great!!
1,Works great for getting info and weather. Good for playing music also
1,"This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
1,Got this to use with my SmartThings home automation system. Use voice commands from the Echo to trigger automation. Much more convenient than getting your phone out and loading the SmartThings app. Sometimes it has a hard time understanding what I say.
1,has all the apps and functions the kids will ever want..
1,"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price."
1,"My Kindle is fast and clear. I can change the size of the font, making it easier to read."

1,"Wasn't sure if my non-techie family member would get much use out of this, but still gave it to them as a birthday gift. I was so wrong to underestimate how much they would enjoy this product. They can't stop raving about it. They loved it so much that they also bought the echo dot to use in their bedroom. They like how simple and easy this is to setup and use."
1,I bought a firestick for every television in my house. I can watch whatever I want and it also decreases my cable bill.
1,Bought this as a gift for a wedding and the couple could not be any happier. Very easy to use and fun to experiment with.
1,"The Amazon echo began as basically a speaker for music. I waited until it started getting more and more features and skills before I bought it, but I'm glad I did. I actually bought 2 echo dots first, mainly for the home automation skills, but then decided to get the ""big"" echo to leave in the kitchen to use with both skills and to listen to music. It works great and the speaker is of decent quality."
1,"This has been user friendly for my dad, who is 78. Always provides entertainment and meets his computer needs."
1,"I just got this a few days ago, and very impressed with how lightweight it is! The device has taken all the best things and compacted it into a stick that take up minimal space."
1,i actually purchased for a friends daughter and she is very happy
1,Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
1,It is really a nice addition to our kitchen. My wife loves the timers and I love the music. We also like the various jokes and interaction.
1,"I bought this just to listen to music with my daughter but I use so much more, shopping lists, reminders, timers etc. I recommend anyone to get one"
1,"This is an inexpensive kindle that works great. It is a little slow loading which can be annoying, but I do love it - especially because of the price."
1,"I was looking for ways to cut cost from a raising cable bill and a friend suggested I try the Amazon Fire. At first I didn’t know if this was something I could do. Once I was able to maneuver through the process, I love it."
1,Converts any TV into a smart TV. Added Kodi to mine and works great.
1,Love this device would definitely recommend love it
1,I bought this for my mom for Mother's day. It is easy to use and she likes to play games and read books with it. You can do lots more as well. This is a great product for a nice price.
1,"Received this for a christmas gift. Actually never heard of it before then. Have been using it for traffic information in the mornings before heading to work, quick homework questions with the kids, and music. Really a nice adult toy."
1,Easy to use and good quality .....................
1,It's great for reading books. I like it because you don't have to buy real books anymore
0,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
1,I love it for reading magazines and checking my email.
1,"Alexa is lots of fun and can do a lot of things. The only thing I would add is the ability for alexa to call 911. This would be a great feature for seniors and people with disabilities, or for anyone in case of emergency."
1,My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
1,Great tablet for the price if you don't want to spend a small fortune
1,I love having Alexa. We have 3 echo and one dot. Love that I turn off my lights.
0,"Not what I expected, I am not satisfied with the product"
1,I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
1,My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.
1,The only complaint is that you get a year free of Amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel.
1,"Very convenient, easy to use, excellent quality. Love it!"
1,The sales person was very helpful and informative.
1,Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good
1,You couldn't get a better buy for $59 than the Amazon fire 7. Paid the extra $20 to get the 16gb. Well worth it.
1,"Just as I thought, works flawlessly as described by Amazon. Moving towards automation."
1,This is the best device for streaming very fast....
1,"et me start by saying, please do not buy this tablet expecting it to be comparable to an Ipad or Samsung tablet. I think the people who expect that are the ones who are disappointed by its features.I personally love this tablet. I wanted a tablet so that I could read, check emails, watch shows ( Hulu, Netflix, AMC), shop online and do some web surfing. I am a pretty simple gal. I did not expect much when purchasing this tablet. I assumed the picture quality would be fairly poor, that it would load pretty slowly, and that I would be unable to download most of the apps I wanted. It wouldn't have bothered me, being that I believe you get what you pay for ( and I could not afford an Ipad or Samsung at the moment). Boy was I proven wrong.I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality from the moment I turned it on. I have had other tablets ( and paid about the same) with terrible picture quality. I actually love watching my shows on this tablet because it is as if I am watching them on my television.This tablet loads pretty darn quickly. I have never had an issue with it loading slowly or getting stuck.I have been able to download EVERY app that I wanted, except Instagram ( oh well, no biggie). And me being the Amazon freak that I am, I was happy to see Amazon apps pre-loaded onto the tablet ( shopping, music etc. ). Speaking of music, the sound quality is pretty great too!I am very very happy with this purchase, it really is a steal. I would buy another for sure."
0,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
1,I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.
1,A lot of fun it is great I can wait to try all the features of it on my home I'm going to get the lights
1,"My wife loves reading, and being able to have so many books to choose from is great. The price of the kindle is also great. If you factor in the cost of books. This was a great investment for her."
1,I recently bought it and it was my first kindle. Previously seen the color version (kindle fire) & comparing the kindle paper white vs other tablets I like that you can read ebook only so there is no distraction. Usually when I grab an iPad or any smart tablet the least I do is read since there so many other things you can do. The kindle paper white will put you to read the minute you grab it leaving the last page you left off on your ebook. It's lightVery clear (easy on your eyes)Back light for night use( adjustable brightness)Comparing all the models this one was the best pick for the money.
1,"Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints."
1,Bought as a gift as I have had one for years and love it.
1,i always buy from best buy. they have excellent products.The workers are very knowledgeable of what they sell.Thanks

With my new Paperwhite, I never have that problem, and I can even carry around more than one book! I absolutely love my Kindle Paperwhite!"
1,"Love the idea that this tablet is expandable to 128GB. The Ipad Mini 2 that I also have does not compare even close to this tablet, as it is not expandable beyond its 16GB. Overall, just an outstanding tablet."
1,I bought this tablet for my ten year old son. It's perfect for him! He loves to download music and games on it.

1,We love it so far. We are still learning more about it.
1,This product did not disappoint me. I purchased it on the deal of the day and do not regret it for a second. Great sound quality and unbelievably accurate with voice commands.
1,"Not much new to be said. Beautiful screen, long battery life, great to own if you love to read."
0,Alexa is not able to answer more than basic querys
1,We love the Echo. You ask it questions and you will get an answer

1,I purchased the tablet for my Christmas Angel. He loved the tablet and case.
1,the recipient of this tablet uses it often and loves it so much that I'm buying one for myself.
1,"I had previously purchased the first kindle fire for reading but I would get distracted with all those other apps you can get on it. When the kindle paper white came out I decided Ill give it a try. I love reading in the dark with it and that it looks like the pages in a physical book. I also love the word wise it helps to review words you didnt know later if you want, growing your vocabulary."
1,"Wonderful graphics, it met all my expectations. The camera and the price were a great bonus."
1,Amazons fire tab is amazing entry level tab. just go for it.
0,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there

1,great for simple use of only reading. and able to read in the sunshine.
1,"I love it! If I ever get to where I can use even half of its features I'll be satisfied. I bought it because my wife reads all the time, and wanted something that would read to her. We didn't even know about the Movies and other things that are available. The Camera is so nice! All of this and ALEXI too! GREAT!!! Bob Jones..."
1,I wanted to give something to my younger brother without being precarious
1,"Have a 7"", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great."
1,"The Amazon Fire 7"" tablet is a good value for the money. You can do all the things you would do with most other tablets. It is pretty simple to use. You can take photos, play games, access email, Facebook, etc."
1,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo."
1,Great new tablet as always due to new techknowledgy
1,excellent product for the pricelightweight user friendly
1,having fun with it would tell a friend to try this one great sound

1,Bought it for mothers day and she hasn't put it down yet.

1,"Recognizes any voice including our grandkids, no training required. Much faster than surfing the net for info, amazon provides great capability, can't wait to add gadgets."
1,Good size for kids. Recommend buying a case for it since its small
1,"I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
1,"It's light and convenient to carry. I can, in fact, carry it in my jacket pocket. So it's good when I am moving around by bus. Book downloads are instant and don't take a long time; something I was concerned about. And the screen is truly comfortable, no strain whatsoever. The functions within the Kindle are also convenient enough to use. I bought it for $99 during Black Friday deals."
1,I have to admit I actually like this thing. I wish it would browse things on the internet a little more but oh well
1,I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.
1,Works as advertised. Amazing product! I would highly recommed this product.
1,"I love that I can check my text from my watch, rather than pulling my phone out at inappropriate times. It helps me stay organized. There are so many features that are helpful. I reviewed the Apple Watch and I'm glad I choose this one instead, even though I have an iPhone, this watch works for all my needs."
1,I really enjoy the kindle fire.It is easy to use and fast.
1,"Having the echo is great, especially for playing music, searching web. Love it!!!!"
1,"i use this tablet for everything. facebook, youtube,and games! the screen is so crystal clear. plus it has expandable memory!"
1,"This is a fun and convenient toy, but I'm surprised about some of the limitations. I keep hearing the same NPR news clip when I ask for news or headline news. I would like more news highlights. When I ask for 80s music, Echo starts with the same 1 of 3 songs each time."
1,It's processor is super fast plus plays movies & tv shows so clear! I love it!! Best money I ever spent!!
1,This is a great device to have and use. I have two
1,This is a great buy I would recommend to anyone looking for a tablet.Plus a year free of Amazon prime

1,My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
1,"great tablet for kids but a lot of ads , for someone who wants a cheap tablet that more or less can do all stuff this is a good choice"
0,Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better
1,This product is great for regular use. I like it. It is good as a gift.
1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenage son. He's been very pleased with it. The battery lasts long, it is small and light enough to fit in his jacket pocket, and the selection of books is awesome. Great product."
1,picked this item up on Halloween nite. Great content and shows-will recommend to friends and family
1,My wife really enjoys the amazon fire. Has very good picture quality. Very easy to figure out how to use because its similar to our smart phone.
1,"This kindle is so good on so many levels. Not sure it is worth the price premium over the paperwhite, but you will definitely have the best reader on the market."
0,I was quite disappointed when I began working through the menus and discovered that my 2 year old Roku 3 was far more intuitive. Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it? I am a fan of Amazon services and a Prime member but I also don't want to throw my money away. Roku is still the best.
1,"Fun to use, great speaker. Easy to set up and use."
1,"This was purchased to have a second Echo in the house. The first one I have was placed in the living/kitchen area, as I use it to play music, add notes (a lot of items to my shopping lists) and appointments/reminders to my calendar. I love having a second Echo in the bedroom to give me the news brief in the morning, give me a status of the traffic and weather conditions, play music, etc. I've noticed a lot of imitations popping up by different companies, however, Echo is the best and has become an integral part of our house and lives. It sounds dramatic, but it's definitely true. Amazon constantly updates and adds new abilities/features. The ability to link it to lights, thermostat, etc. let's me think we are keeping up with the Jetsons! Highly recommend buying an Echo!"
1,"Loved it so much I bought another one. The hands free is so good. I use it in my shop, when I am busy I just tell it to stop and it does."
1,"I would not recommend it as a primary tablet, but its ok for reading and simple games."
1,"Bought this to compare to my Fire TV Stick. No comparison! No buffering, quick responses my button presses, and I wouldn't trade it for nothing!"
1,"I bought this Kindle Fire for my daughter for Christmas, and she has completely enjoyed it. Build quality seems good, and I have been impressed with how Amazon has increased the functionality of its basic Kindle Fire over the iterations of this product (I also own a first generation Fire). It remains a very viable product and a joy to use."
1,"This tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. This was purchased to replace a 4 year old iPad mini, and I could not be happier. This work great."
1,Good price for a high quality product. Easy to use and navigate.
1,We now have 2 of these in our home because we love this model kindle

1,What can I say but out of this world. This thing is so cool.
1,I gave this to me niece as a christmas gift and it she was very happy with it.

1,Love my kindle. It work so good i take it everywhere i go
1,I purchase a tablet at best buy and the price was and it was it I love my tablet thank you so best buys
1,"I don't really care about the built in Amazon apps. I use this tablet for Xfinity TV streaming and it works great. Since it's Amazon, I don't expect them to abandon updates like the cheap Chinese tablets. It's not speedy fast, but for the money it is hard to beat."
1,"Note, the information on the Best Buy site is wrong, this is not a 4G device but rather a 3G device. It really makes no difference but just for clarity, lets get it right. Very light and small e-reader with a very good display and the squeeze functionality for page turning is a nice addition. Not a revolutionary device but evolutionary."
1,Exactly what I needed at an affordable price! GREAT purchase!
1,It works for just what I need it to. Reading. I also love how the camera works & the games.
1,Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great.
0,"While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose."
1,This was the perfect gift for Mother's Day!! Awesome and easy to set up!
1,"Buy this for my friend Have one at home... good sound,fast response and easy to setup."
0,I thought this product would be a lot better than it is. It is not as smart as they say it is. It has a long way to go.

1,"Great tablet for kids. Big choice of apps, great price."
1,"Was using the fire stick, but they get hot and loose performance. The Fire Tv is faster and so far has had no problems what so ever. It's a little pricey, but you can watch all your internet shows with out interruptions. This unit came with voice commands."
1,Got it as a gift for my son to replace his old kindle.
1,"I was hesitant to buy this before but now feel that I made the right choice. Alexa syncs well will spotify and smart bulbs.Apart from listening music and too lazy to switch on/off lights, i can get an update about nearby traffic, weather before even getting out of the bed."
1,Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...
1,I like it but can get more info I use google. Can't answer very many questions. The music feature is works well.
1,Love the color just the right size easy to set up works well for what I needed it for great price
1,"Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new"
1,I got this echo for my mother for christmas. She likes asking it things. It has a lot to learn though. Goggle seems smarter

1,Amazon Echo's are great. Easy to use voice control.
1,The kindle is amazing and I love everything about it.
1,Great product and service at best buy great to help me purchase
1,This Echo voice activated speaker made life so much easier. Also the sound emanating from it exceeded my expectations.
0,"I bought this product for traveling for its light weight and paper like reading. It was fine with e-books, but I had some PDF file I wanted to read on it. I could load the PDFs, but hard to read. No font enlargable for PDFs. Plus, the screen is not very responsive as screens in tablets. I ended up return it."
1,It was good. I like it. Easy and simple to use. Better than apple ipad
1,i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net
1,The item works great wish the speeds were faster like the fire box but it still gets the job done just the same.
1,Easy to use and lots of fun. Was easy to purchase.
1,Kindle Paprrwjite is the best e-reader out there. Go for it!
1,"The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time."
1,"We don't do as much with the Echo as we could - and should - but so far it's been fun, and works well. There are some things it can't do, of course. Alexa cannot provide stock market information, for example."
1,I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed my Amazon Fire TV. It hooks up to your television seamlessly and provides a wide assortment of viewing options. This device could easily replace your cable television.
1,"I like it. However, when reading the page number is not shown. Also unable to use the dictionary. Still in the 'new' stage."
1,Love my firetv box... who needs cable. Even better then the stick!
1,A really low price for an amazing little pad. Quad chip
1,"I did a lot of research before jumping in and buying the Fire TV. I am glad I took the plunge. I haven't had any issues at all since day one. The speed is great, with no lag, and the recent update just kicked things up a notch. I love it!"
1,I'm really enjoying my Amazon FireTv. It's everything I though it would be.
1,Better than nook also cheaper. If toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice. Great for reading and basic searching.
1,"I bought for my son, and He love it, He is 8 years old"
1,Mom and Dad already have Kindles. It was time for the 9-year-old to have one of her own. This was perfect: Great size and an even greater price!
1,Easy peasy to install and operate remote controller!
1,Fast enough to play videos and movies . Also esay to install
1,Great functionality and quality for the price. I've bought several of these for customer giveaways and have yet to hear a complaint!
1,Good for price. One should not expect the quality of iPad from this product
1,"I can't believe how well the far field microphones work. It can hear me over music, TV, or noise from our kids. It's been a great addition."
1,Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
1,"The 7"" screen is a good size and I really like the touch screen. This is a great tablet!"
1,Even as a speaker alone this item is worth the price!
1,This is the best tablet I have bought. It is better than the $200 kindle fire I bought a few years ago. It has wonderful apps for children as well as the great amazon apps I like!
1,I preorder 4 for my kids and they love it. The use it to connect with families in Mexico. They use it for school as well when they need to use the web.
1,"We prefer the Google Home; it has easy setup, and neighbors communications are not transmitted to us."
1,"Works great, makes a great gift! ................."
1,"My family love how easy it is to ask ""Alexa"" to play music and some information. My 5year old daughter love to play songs on it all day! Fun product!!"

1,Very Happy with purchase. Only getting started....

1,I love my kindle fire. It does exactly what I need it to do and more
1,This is an excellent tool to help our granddaughter advance her learning skills and also allows her an opportunity to play educational games

1,i really love this product i have down loaded many many books and i like it because it is big when i brought mine my sister returned and purchased her one too
1,Great product for the dollar. Recommend this item to others.
1,"Been dragging my feet to get one of these. Once you learn everything it can do, you'll love it!"
1,"We usre the echo alot in the house, even connected to our Harmony Hub and Home Automation to control the house."
1,I have the fire stick and now the box. Highly recommend.
1,"I am looking forward to getting one for myself. The person I got this for for swore up and down he din't want a tablet or need one. Now he loves it, even for reading. I thought he would never give up paperbacks."
1,Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice
1,This tablet makes reading and watching video more enjoyable.
1,We purchased two Paperwhite's and gave one to our daughter. So far so good.
1,Product works as described. Product was also very easy to install and set up.
1,"I like the overall performance, especially the remote. User interface can be better/improvement needed ... purchase of apps is automatic and need additional layers of checks/authentication"
1,Great purchase. Good for entertainment. And it talks
1,This is a really great tablet me and my kids love it.
1,"Best bang for you buck tablet. Running Android, but without the Google services. If you have Amazon Prime then this will be great for your traveling needs. You can expand the memory with a memory card and the Amazon App store has plenty of apps."
1,Great product very easy to use. Very good for programs such as Lodi.
1,This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.
1,"This is my second kindle & its lighter than the 1st, & nice to read my books on"
1,"For what I need, this unit works great. I use it mostly to catch up on reading and looking at photos that I load via MicroSD card. Great resolution."
1,I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
1,"Once you can figure out all the apps you can connect to the echo for entertainment you'll be set. But it wouldnt just play a song if you asked Alexa to play a song, she would say something like: it's not in your playlist, you need to update your Amazon acct or something to that extent. But...very entertaining..."
1,"I had the Fire model befor this one & it was ok, but way too locked down. This one is basically an Android tablet, with some key features added for Amazon. Little too baby for reading though, prefer my Paper White for that. But, great tablet for surfing, games, and movies/YouTube. The ONLY downside, won't connect over 5ghz (Wireless-N), stuck on the 2.5ghz connections."
1,"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
1,"I upgraded from an older, no-backlight Kindle and this one is much more comfortable to read. Overall a great value. The battery charge lasts forever and you can load it with enough to read for years."
1,"Its a great tool, however it was hard to use in the beginning. Not sure what happened but I had a hard time connecting to the WiFi at the hotel I was stating at."
1,"Installed easily. No issues so far. Using it for netflix, amazon prime, and playstation vue."
0,I love that my son loves to read and all so the Kindle is perfect for him. It updates and is very easy to use. I don't like that it's as fragile as it is. My 12 year old has plenty of electronics but the screen has already cracked on this one. I'm not too happy about that.
1,I own a larger Kindle but find it hard to just throw in my purse or travel with. This was a great price & perfect size. My granddaughter even got to use it to watch Netflix on while confined to bed after surgery. Very pleased with my purchase.
0,I love reading books on here. Playing games are also nice for the kids with the free time kid app. Only thing I don't like is the sound is not very loud. If the sound was louder it would get a 5 star rating.
1,It is just the right size for my sons and daughter!!! They even know how to work it themselves!
1,This is my second Kindle purchased. First one was 15 years ago and now the Kindle Voyage 2. I love my Kindle. You can read anywhere even outside in the sun. I read more than ever :)
0,"Alexa works great for listening to spotifly (only if you have premium) and very basic information (time, weather). She has a tough time answering questions. This is not a Google machine. She consistently would not understand simple questions. The volume is very loud and can be adjusted manually or through voice. She also can learn skills which some are hit and miss. I'd still recommend this product if you have a smart home (smart outlets, locks) or if you have spotifly premium."
1,This a very good little tablet for my young boys to use
1,this speaker is the coolest thing since sliced bread. you can ask her anything and she will answer you in 1 second and play any music you ask her to.
1,"Best Buy was supposed to give me $20 for the purchase of the kindle and I was told that I would get an email. I never did. The Kindle does what it says however I prefer the buttons to turn the pages that were on the 1st & 2nd models. Also I prefer to have the name of the book listed rather than a picture of the cover of the book. The picture is too small and unclear which makes it difficult to see which book it is and you only get three on the first page. I prefer to see as much as possible at first glance. Also, I love the lighting that is adjustable and allows you to read in bed and does not disturb my night's rest. Overall, I really enjoy using it."
1,My internet is so awful that streaming music is so choppy and sporadic it reminds me of vinyl records #likeabroken record
1,Great for reading in bedNot to heavy with great screen
1,My kids read books play games take pictures they love this.
1,So easy to read and very easy on your eyes. Recommended for storing your books.
1,I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
1,"This is a great tablet for a good price. I bought this for my mother that has no clue about computers, tablets or anything technical. It's basically used for her to play games and she is able to navigate thru with a tutorial from me."
0,I needed this for my two six year olds to be able to use during our drive to Disney. You are unable to get most apps that are offered on iTunes and android market so I returned.
1,This little box is awesome. If you have Amazon Primeits a must have and even if you don't it's still worth it's weight in gold. Sure just about every device can play Netflix or any of your other streaming services but this thing is quick. With Prime you can also add Starz or Showtime for an additional fee and that'll give you access to all there content from this things native interface no other apps needed.
1,"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
1,Excellent product as reviewed and very convenient for vacations
1,"Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great."
0,"This is an excellent device and easy to use. 5 stars if you have Amazon Prime and want to use what's included with Prime. But if you don't have Prime, any Android TV Box would be better at half the cost."
1,"All your services in one place. UI takes a little getting used to, but becomes 2nd nature."
0,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I was excited about this new product and downloaded the Alexa App. I am not an Amazon Prime member and I did not joined the free trial. I asked questions to my Alexa and it usually did not provide any answers, or couldn't understand my questions despite giving simple commands. The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant. I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills. It also provides more answers to questions and I was surprise by the detail of the answer at time. I highly recommend to Google Home device. I have not tested it with chromecast, Smart TV, or with Smart home appliances such as Nest, etc."
1,"My daughter is away at school, and she uses this inexpensive Amazon tablet, which she won't is should something happen to it, and it'll be easy to replace. It has all the functions she needs, though it doesn't support some apps, but it does support all the popular social media and has a decent camera. It's easy to use, big enough to read on, but it's not huge, and it's easy to hold, store and carry. My daughter enjoys the orange cover."
1,Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Nice screen and functions well.
1,Me: Alexa...right this review for me. Alex: Write your own review.Me: I guess Alexa can't do everything...or maybe she just chooses not to. Hmmmmm.
1,My order was sent to quickly and had precisely what I asked. I will order by these means in the future.
1,I got this product for my 2 year granddaughter to play games on. I am currently checking into purchasing the monthly $5 kids mode for her as it now has many pop ups.
1,I have been very pleased with my Voyage. It operates as advertised and has been a pleasure to use. Very well pleased with battery life.
1,This table was use for watching YouTube and it's perfect with awesome stunning picture quality comparing to all other expensive ones. This is very affordable.
1,This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold.
1,I bought 5 tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas. They loved them. Ages ranged from 5 to 12. Made shopping easy for this grandma.
1,I am very satisfied with it. It is exactly what I was looking for.
0,The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.
1,My eyes feel good with paperwhite when lights out.
1,"Great tablet, excellent price. Kids and adults enjoy watch movies, play games, internet, etc."
1,very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff
1,Use my amazon fire tv everyday for everything tv shows and movies listen to music and play games
1,We love our Amazon Echo so much we went back and bought one for our daughter for this upcoming Christmas! Ordered a dimmer smart switch along with a Samsung smart things hub. This is a awesome device and is always learning. Can't wait to use it more to its full potential.
1,Good product with good features. Like the suggestion books in email.
1,This is my second Kindel the old one gave out after many years of service
1,The paperwhite kindle is the best option for someone who is just looking for a kindle to read on and download books. Would not have chosen a different one at all.
1,Such fun. Always new ways to get information and have fun.
1,"I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point."
1,"I ordered this from online and was worried that it would not function as well as the Amazon Kindle Fire. To my surprise, my children love them! The product was well priced, as well as having great features. I couldn't have brought a better Christmas present for them. I allowed them to customize and wrap their Amazon Fires. They can't wait to open it on Christmas day, as my 5 year old asks ""is it Christmas yet"" every day now lol...I would definitely recommend the purchase of this as well as the protection, it's worth it!"
1,I heard about it from a friend. It's awesome. Saves you a lot of $$$$$
1,Alexa is an excellent product. My family uses a number of options that are available through it. The sound quality is extremely good and it stays on all of the time. So glad we have Alexa!!
1,Performance and interface are great!!! And you can add most of Android apps too!!!
1,Whole family has there own and we all love them no matter what we want to do
1,Good if you're looking for a no frills internet experience. Very affordable.
1,GAVE THIS TO MY WIFE. IT SERVES IT'S PURPOSE GREAT PRICE.
1,This streamer box is very easy to set up. It finds the WiFi quickly. A nice and enjoyable addition to cord cutting.
1,Got it as a gift for my grandma and she loves it!!
1,I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money
1,"Bought this for my hubby. Loves it- great for music, recipes, etc."
1,Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
1,"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price."
1,"I bought this kindle so I could read in the sun without having any glare. Great purchase, can read anywhere I want to."
1,This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle.
1,I bought two of these as gifts for Christmas. One for my mom and one for a 9 yr. old. I'm a tech geek so I think these are great to introduce to and older parent or small kid just because of the price alone (Not for us tech guru's). I got them on black Friday for $34.99. Great e reader and awesome for games like candy crush. Only downside is the 8gb but for $34.99 that's not even an issue!
1,"Alexa is really fun to use and i just bought a smart outlet that she works with. It's great, because you can use her for so many things."
1,I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
1,"Have several in my home and my dad was intrigued by them and how they can be used for the smart home. Got one for him for Father's Day and he loves it. First step for him in setting up his own smart home. Next is the Samsung smart hub, hue bulbs, schlage connect and nest thermostat."
1,I bought this as a gift for my four year old to read onand play educational games on. She loves it and it was a great price.
1,Kindle fire 7 is a great affordable tablet has everthing i need.
1,It's a very nice tablet. Still learning how to use it. Always something new to learn on this tablet
1,I bought this for my son. He likes that he can take it with him where ever he goes. Great quality for the money. I paid 3x this for my kindle and this one does everything mine does. I'll be purchasing more as Christmas gifts.
1,My grandson loves this tablet kid friendly .He plays with this all the time .
1,He plays his games and we can put parental controls on this tablet.
1,My grandchildren enjoy their Fire. It is great for any educational problems
1,Excellent tablet for watching movies and TV. Get the extra memory SD card and you will be good to go.
1,"Having all that information at my fingertips is so handy. We were always looking up info on our phones, now we just ask Alexa. Tying it into the home makes life so much easier. I don't have to get out of bed because I left the lights on in the other room or adjusting the temp. in the middle of the night."
1,I got this for my three year old for Christmas and she loves it!
1,"Great kindle for my needs, it is easy to use and comfortable."
1,"Unit is nifty for some functions, it would be good with a prime membership. I expect a little more usable content without additional purchase for the price tag. Still have not fully explored the unit."
1,This is what I wanted. Easy to use. Can read outdoors or indoors. Easy to add books that I purchase. I would recommend to anyone looking for a similar devise.
1,Works as expected without any glitches.Very happy with the purchase
1,"I love my echo and use it to order takeout, news briefings, weather, Jeapordy and to control my lights. Awesome tech gadget."
0,"I bought this tablet on Black Friday and it was on sale. It's incredibly slow, and the screen quality is mediocre. What bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet. I only really use it to watch Netflix- so it's fine, but don't expect anything above that to function well on this device."
1,This Fire is a bit smaller than my Kindle Fire from a few years back. I still seems to have all the features and is 1/2 the price.
1,The tap is amazing. portable and connected to all amazon content
1,Works great for all my steaming needs. I was able to transform my non smart tv.
1,Love it! Great Tablet!! Lots of ways to download lots of fun games and apps.
1,"Love waking up in the morning & easily getting my calendar & the weather from Alexa. Then I can tell Alexa to play my fav morning radio station. In the evenings, she helps me cook with measurement conversions & we play daily Jeopardy:). And I keep discovering more that we can do with this fun device!"
1,firstly when I installed it. felt not much things to do with fire tv. but I am getting new features everyday by googling. a lots lots lots of features. I am enjoying mirroring feature of the product now.
1,Easy to read screen in a small light package. Excellent battery life and even fits into my work pockets.
1,Great size for on the go to do basic needs. Also great for kids to be accupied with.
1,This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!
1,There shouldnt be an 8 gig tablet. Not enough internal memory. Kindle Fire tablets work on a modified Android operating system. But other than that a good tablet for the price.
1,"Amazon, did a good job with this box. The factory andriod allows for plug and use or modify it up!"
1,"I love the quality on the streaming is my first box I have 2 firesticks, amazing box from amazon."
1,My kids are very pleased with their tablets and i was please with how easy it was to set up and use right away
1,The new Kindle Paperwhite is such a great improvement Love it so much!!!
1,Easy to use and easy to order books. Now I just have to join amazon prime for the lending library and look into the books i haven't read but want to.
1,"Great product we love it, buybuyby good good good product"
1,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV and placed it on my TV in the bedroom, this is a great product and I really enjoy it."
1,"I like it, but don't like the add screen that you can't get rid of. Also can only download apps from the amazon store."
1,This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.
1,Goog!I would recommend this to a friend!!!I like it
1,Bought this as a gift/prize for a Project Graduation party. The winner was super excited!
1,This paperwhite works well. It is easy to use. I would recommend. It is lighter than the fire I was using to read books on.
1,It is easy to use without having to read the instructions.
1,I bought this product for my nephew for Christmas. I was very impressed with how cheap it was price wise. He took it out of the box to use and it was very user friendly when it was set up. He enjoyed being able to download his games and how easy it was to use altogether. Thank you Best Buy and Amazon for making it the best Christmas ever
1,"It would be beneficial to have amazon prime to give even more options. Very easy to use and set up was simple. The ability to add other Wifi devices is a great option. We use it to turn lights on, adjust our thermostat, play music, answer questions and so much more."
1,Like the music at your command. We keep in the kitchen. Everyone in the family can add to grocery list. That Alexa app on our phone reminds us what to pick up at store.
1,I would love to get one for my Dad for Father's Day!
1,"Alexa really works. I was sceptical at first, now she is part of the family. I'm cooking , I have three different things on the go, microwave, stovetop, and outside on the grill; all need to be pulled off the heat at different times. No problem , I just ask Alexa to set timers for each item as I go along, awesome! Time to watch a movie now , "" Alexa turn off living room lights "" The lights dim and she confirms with ""OK "" - nice. A little bit too warm, "" Alexa, set temperature to 69° "" The air-conditioner comes on ,magical . My nephew does not like what we are cooking, "" Alexa open Domino's "" she asks for my order choice, within seconds Dominos has the order, paid for , arrives on time . This is truly one of the coolest devices I have ever purchased . I almost forgot, anytime I want to hear a piece of music that I loved from my past I just call it out and she can pull it up right there and then I can listen to it, in near Bose quality sound , Magic!!!!"
1,Wish it had an open market for other apps and not limited to amazon
1,"Love it , so easy to use and you can easily just talk to the control"
1,I really enjoy the amazon tablet for paying my bills online and looking up recipes.
1,I love this product and my kids use it everyday to watch movies and serials.
1,"Got this for Playstation Vue and realized we love it for all our other TV services too. So easy to search for shows - Alexa finds the shows and gives you all options on how to watch (Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO, Prime, etc.).We use on wifi connection and never have any issues. Super fast and clear for all programs including channels on Playstation Vue."
1,"Alexa answers questions, sets timers, plays music, she's great"
1,I like the paper white for reading because it doesn't have the glare like all the tablets with color and it makes reading feel like you are reading from a paper book without all the weight
1,"We are super happy with the kindle fire. We had bought several DVD players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. Now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. It also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. We love it!"
1,cable package keeps going up. i downgraded package. friend recommended this. in the long run i am saving money. can look at such so many different video programs and movies.
1,LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
1,"Got this on black Friday for 35 bucks for my 2 year old for youtube viewing, for my 2 year old it's amazing does the job decent battery.It's not that fast or the screen ain't that great but for 35 bucks you get what you pay forI think it's great for kids if you need to do serious stuff on tablet and thinking you can get away with it with this tablet definitely do not buy it"
1,I love mine because it's lightweight and I can take it anywhere
1,This has to be the best of all Amazon products for the television... you can store more memory and the rom speed makes no lag time on any show ... after this i will never buy a fire stick again...
1,The device is fun and informative to use. I would buy this item again and also give it as a gift
1,"Amazon echo just keeps getting better and better. It now works with my Lowe's Iris smart home automation. It dims lights, turns off TVs and so much more. It also works with many other home automation devices with means more to expand with."
1,"Easy to use reliable interface possible house hold money saver, if properly moded lol"
1,"Kindle fire is great for kids. Not only is there educational games, but if they break it they are not that expensive to replace. Also with Best buy you can get a replacement plan for them. This is the only tablet we will be getting for the kids for now on."
1,This replaced a 4 year old kindle for my 67 year old mother. Extremely glad i went with another Kindle and the fire is awesome! resolution is great! Does everything needed and with ease!
1,Nice being able to get news updates while making meals/doing other things. Kids find it very entertaining as well.
1,"Bought this as a gift as I was on a budget, I figured it would be okay but I got say it is actually faster than my iPad Air with connectivity and more than abundant features and apps"
1,Nothing comes close. So much faster then anything else out there.
1,"I really like Alexa, this has been one of the funnest purchases I've made :-)"
1,"I love alexa. She can make me laugh, keep up with my grocery list, play lullabys for my baby and minions songs for my toddler. Her weather forcasts are awesome. The only thing i wish she knew as well is how to speak other languages. If you ask her she says she only speaks english right now but is always learning. So i cant wait until that update happens! So cool."
1,Good for kids and parents great products hope to get mote
1,Bought it as a birthday present for my son and he loves it. Easy to use and works fast.
1,"This is a nice low price entry point into the tablet market. Some folks use them allot, while others don't. This is a non-expensive way to find out."
1,Mom like Echo...she talks to it and it talks back.
0,Crazy that you have to buy these separate for some kindle products that should come with one
1,This little black box is awesome. So easy to setup and use. The choices of entertainment are outstanding
1,I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
1,"I have had the Echo since Thanksgiving. I love asking ""Alexa"" questions like movie showtimes close by, or current sports scores. I also enjoy playing a round of Jeopardy once in a while. It makes it easy to listen to the radio and to play just about any song I want, even if I am not sure of the lyrics. It is one of those conveniences that you wonder how you did without it."
1,She loves it. She is 20 months old and already has command of it. Micky and Minnie rule it!
1,This is a great tablet for kids to uses for downloading games and using the internet.
1,Alexa is fun to use and the speaker is plenty loud for my bedroom. Haven't installed anything for home animation yet.
1,Works. You must have the unit hard wired to your network to get the unit to sync with your phone or tablet so they can be used as a remote.
0,The only reason I chose 1 star is because of size. The length is disproportionate to the width. Awkward when holding it.
1,Nice screen which is easy to read. We will have to see how it hold up with kids in the house.
1,Great buy and good starter for a smart home if you got all accessories
1,Great gift for someone who is into the latest technology gadgets.
1,make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
1,"Great sound and voice response, easy to set up and use."
1,"You will very quickly learn how to talk to her in a way that she will understand and it's not unlike speaking to a small frustrating toddler. Alexa, when was George Washington born? George Washington was born...blah blah Alexa stop. There were rumors his teeth were wood but these turned out to be false, ALEXA stop speaking! There will be many times she will not understand what you're saying which can be both frustrating and hilarious. Alexa, put tomatoes on my shopping list. I've put potatoes onto your shopping list....Well, guess I'm eatin potatoes. That said, now that I've learned how to speak to the Echo it usually does exactly what I want it to do. I think the echo is well worth the price"
1,"There is so much you can do with this, it really is a must have for anyone who loves tech."
1,"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
1,"Better than the stick cause you can plug in Ethernet cable for faster secure connection, faster processor, and more memory"
1,I love this. wish I brought a bigger screen one....
1,"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
1,"I'm glad I bought this, it's super fast, faster than the stick and the picture quality is amazing."
1,"Bought this for my 5 year old girl. She immediately fell in love with it. And the fact that it has a year damage warranty, it was a no brainer"
1,This is my second Kindle Fire and I wouldn't be without one. Excellent little device for reading books and playing games. Use it daily to watch Netflix.
0,turns out this was not necessary ... being returned.
1,I bought it over kindle HD for my kid to encourage his reading instead of internet/game addiction. He completed Harry Potter series in 3 weeks. What a good decision to but it.
1,Easy to useBattery life is goodEasy to read a book
0,"I have the Kindle Fire HD, so when i bought this i expected something up to that caliber or better. Sadly, it did not. In my opinion the older one is better in sound quality. The new one is lighter, but I did pay less for it."
1,"Wow I was missing out on all the fun and convenient application this little thing can do. I thought oh like a toy and Ill get tired of it, wrong. I now have lights set to it, drop in on friends, ask any question I need answers to, get step by step recipes, just a thousand things, to many to list. Get yourself one, its awesome!"
1,"I love the voice response, it makes multitasking better! I could just say ""Alexa, volume 10"" it raises the volume all the way. The only bad thing is that it has to be connected to an outlet, so its not that portable and it is a bit heavy than expected. Other than that i love it"
1,Plugged it directly into my router for a faster connection and it works great
1,"Excellent price, app store could be better but mainly using this for PBS Kids app for our son and Netflix when mobile."
1,"Best new product to own for anyone, even children.people scoff when they see some kid with a device, but I think they are a great teaching tool.Thanks"
1,"If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers."
1,I've used Roku and Chromecast and I assure you that the Fire TV beats them both by a country mile.
1,Was a late christmas gift to myself. Updated from the paperwhite 2 and the difference is very noticeable.
1,has all the features you will need in a tablet. look no further
1,Love the no glare feature. Perfect for outdoors. This is light weight and will be great for travel.
1,"I bought as a gift for my mom she loves it it's easy to use. She can take photos, watch movies, browse internet"
1,"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device."
1,Yes I will recommend to everybody because I buy 2 of them and my goddaughter And son like it
1,Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!
1,If you have amazon prime this is simply another way gaining more content If you are a cable cutter.. There's also the added plus of adding xbmc and getting additional content for content free.
0,Pretty tangerine color. First tablet had bad earphone jack; Second product would not connect to wifi no matter where we tried. All of our other tablets work fine.We will order another Amazon fire tablet.
1,"I have had several Kindles from the Kindle keyboard, the Fire HDX and a previous version of the Paperwhite. To me, it's the best way to read. You can have hundreds of books at your disposal. Having the 3G version enables me to download books anywhere without being connected to Wi-Fi. I love my Paperwhite!"
0,"When i first got the tablet the screen was damaged, overall it's a decent tablet. Its sorta slow, at the end of the day all i gotta say is only bruisers remain."
1,This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel
1,"It works as advertised, great for college students"
1,Bought this for vacations at the beach - easy to read in the sulight.
1,This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight
1,Good product..............................................................................................................
1,Very nice speaker. Easy to use great voice recognition. Kids love it
1,"Outstanding product at a great price. I previously hand a Kindle reader and the 7"" Fire is a much improved product."
1,"I was a little skeptical on this at first, especially with the price tag to it, but after buying it, it's such a cool piece of tech to have at home or your office. I have one in both places, my girls like using it at home to have dance parties and they're learning the voice commands pretty easily. I use it at work for music, trivia and there are so many other cool tricks it does that makes it a must have."
1,I had a Kindle earlier and rarely used it because the interface did not feel reading-friendly. This one is better. I am using it for two textbooks and find the interface improved. The purchase came with a free month of amazon prime which was a plus -- even though I decided not to renew after the month was over.
1,My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.
1,"I was so pleased with my Fire tablet that I purchased two more for my nieces who are 4 and 2-1/2 years old. Those little fingers love the games and other features and keep the girls busy in their car seats. I love playing games, checking the weather, reading emails, and general surfing on the web with my Fire tablet."
1,I bought 4 then 2 more. Great beginner tablet and great price.
1,I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
1,My daughter has been enjoying it since her birthday
1,"I really enjoyed this purchase,will by this product again"
1,A must have to charge your kindle. Works very well!
1,Now the best memory for facts in the household without ever being smug about it. Sometimes she doesn't know the answer and that makes her even more appealing.
0,I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
1,"The tablet is as you would expect at the price point, nothing too exciting in terms of the tech. But, add a Prime membership and this device really excels at giving you access to all the Prime perks and adds another voice control point for Alexa."
1,"This is another standard Kindle color screen product that replaced our original Kindle 7"". This one is much faster and has more access to apps, although they are all through the kindle store, not android app store. I couldn't for example use my Mcafee anti-virus. I had to use the one that Amazon approved. Over all, a very good upgrade."
1,Love the new fire TV. replaced my Cable TV box. now I just need to have internet services!! save me a ton of money. I can watch live TV to on demand movies. great product!!
1,It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time
0,Echo was easy to set up. Speaker is not as good as the Google Home. Both the Nest thermostat and the Inseon hub seem to be working okay with the Echo.3 stars because I have not used all the functions yet.
1,Good Inexpensive tablet for someone that does not use it that often.
0,"Echo is tough to deal with. Doesn't understand most the questions I ask. You definitely can't do a follow up question. Speaker sounds great. Looks great. Also will hook up to devices for automation. Hopefully they update it for comms, cuz google home is killing it there."
1,I got a great tablet from a great company with excellent customer service.I love buying from best buy and i love the warranties they offer
1,"I bought this as a gift on father's day weekend and he loved it. It's a simple tablet that does everything it's supposed to, excellently. Perfect for reading and watching video and movies. Would recommend if you're not looking for anything too powerful."
1,The kindle is great! Great product and great price.
1,The Kindle paperwight is a great lightweight alternative to my usual 10 inch e-reader tablet for travel and reading outside.
0,Good beginner tablet for older person who likes surf Internet.
1,"Impulse buy, but great choice. Super useful everyday"
1,You can't beat the price. This is the best tabet under $100. Easy to upgrade from one amazon tablet to another as long as you have an amazon account and back up your information.
1,I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.
1,Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
1,This is just what I wanted. Lives up to my expectations and the price was right.
1,"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!"
1,The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
1,User friendly and perfect for my three year old daughter
1,I've been waiting for the ability to expand memory and its here! Along with that Alexa voice feature and an improved graphics engine Fire TV is headed in the right direction.
1,"Oh how I love this product. I spend hours playing solitaire, reading novels, listening to music all provided by my new Kindle Fire! I traded in my old Kindle which I also loved but this new one is a little larger and has more features many of which I haven't used yet. I couldn't be more pleased!"
1,Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.
1,"I have owned several Kindles and Kindle Fires, and I have been happy with all of them. If you already are an Amazon Prime member, you can't go wrong with one of these tablets."
1,We're having fun playing with that but sometimes it doesn't answer the questions that you ask it which is a little confusing for us
1,my grandson had one and likes it. so i bought it for my other grandson
1,I purchased this tablet for my mom for Christmas due to its ease of use and access to Amazon's app store.
1,This fire box is really saving me money from cable
1,Daughter loves it. Screen easy to read. Easy on the eyes.
1,"I gifted this tablet to my niece and she loves its, easy for her to handle."
1,Tablet was purchased by our daughter with her own money. She worked her tail off for this tablet. She loves it and will be using for school and travel.
1,"Amazon Fire stick is perfect for anything. We play the games, stream movies and I like listening to Pandora Music. Its all in one."
1,Perfect size and easy on the eyes. None of that bright light that tables have to blind you in the evening.
1,This was a birthday present to my wife who absolutely loves it and find new things daily Alexa can do.
1,"We're streaming 4K content from our app, and we wanted to test the quality of streaming. Fire TV worked great streaming 4K!"
1,This was a gift for my wife who loves to read. She has the Kindle Fire and enjoys it. Her wishes were to have a smaller lighter reader that is also good to ready outside. She found it with the Voyage.
1,"I use it almost every day, the battery last longer than I think."
1,It's hard to beat the quality for the price it cost. Great for the kids.
1,This tablet is awesome and for an awesome price. It replaced my laptop so much more convenient and easier to carry.
1,"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
0,"As one would expect, this is fine for what it is. A $50 tablet. Better than other $50 tablets on the market. Quicker and more stable. If you're looking for a tablet for a child or for basic surfing and YouTube clip watching it's fine. Apps are limited compared to the google play store."
1,"easy set up , works with all of my smart home products, amazon music is good I recommend this product for all ages"
1,Im looking for my.first tablet! because I don't have a computer.
1,I really like the Amazon Echo. My kids love to play games with it and music.
1,"Got it on sale, works well but it's a bit slow when buffering.Overall we like it."
1,"I just moved and wanted to start fresh without gigantic cable/sat bills. I figured I could use this for netflix, sling tv, and replace the cable clutter and it works wonderfully. CONS: The remote is very basic and it could use a few more buttons, there is no volume or power on/off buttons so you will have multiple remote controls lying around. If you have a smart tv you may not need this as the apps you are looking for may be available on it. PROS: quick, responsive, very sleek and small. Combines everything you need and more."
1,My hole family loves it we don't even watch cable tv any more
1,This is my first time using a kindle. I love that I can read it in all types of light. the size makes it very portable and it's easy to use.
1,I were told about the fire stick tv from a friend so went to a best buy store to buy one.the store had to order me one I had it in my hand in two days and I have been enjoying it. Use it everyday.
1,Purchased for a grandson but everyone in the house enjoys it
1,"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
1,This is an awesome tablet. Very easy to access and read books as well as to add apps
1,Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.
1,Love this tablet. So easy to use. My kids love it.
1,"Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost"
1,Just what I was looking for! Family love it! Will buy it again!
1,Utilizing Alexa has been a great way to connect and control the devices in my home! Alexa was simple to set up and is easy to use.
1,"This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer."
1,"Great sound, easy to set up. Connects to wifi no issues."
1,"Alexa is a practical tool for weather, spelling help, calendar reminders, etc. It is also a lot of fun for finding information and playing music!"
1,"We weren't sure if we needed this, but when it was on sale and we had a $10 reward cert, why not? It looks really sleek. We enjoy having it in the kitchen. We play trivia daily. Other games like ""who wants to be a millionaire "" are also fun. We use pandora daily. Good quality speaker despite our large room. We need to learn how to use it to its full capacity but so far so good!"
0,"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
1,This product lives up to all of its hype my 4 year old grandson can use this with ease
1,"Perfect for those of us who don't want to buy books and really prefer not to carry a stack from the library. Once I got the hang of it, books were easy to load from our local library. The Kindle is easy to hold and I can adjust the page brightness and type size as needed. Would not get though if you want to see color pictures in books."
1,"glad I got this kindle. can take it with me, and I can actually see the screen"
1,"I have had a regular black and white Kindle for years and I love it, but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading. The Fire is perfect, small and light and easy to use."
1,This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
1,"Just simply amazing, I really enjoy it. Very impress with the sound, speaker, volume, and its other great capabilities."
1,"Great Streaming tool, I own this and the the firestick. Have been able to cut the cord finally"
1,"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming."
1,"The Amazon fire is a perfect size for viewing videos, reading books and playing games. Small enough to fit in a bag or purse."
1,Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
1,I like how the software blocks sites from opening if they are malicious sites.
1,"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
1,I love the kindle. It is light weight and the back light is great. Easy to use and get book from the library or from Amazon.
1,"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Dot. The Echo Tap is the best of both and Portable. I have echos in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the patio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Alexa too I have access to great music, Howard stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Alexa and wifi. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Alexa now more than she talks to me."
1,"Alexa is so much more than a gateway to Amazon services. We use the Echo for music, cooking timers, controlling the lights of our home. The best is when the kids add items to our Alexa shopping list. Makes it super easy to build a grocery list.Super easy to set up. Works great. You should have one in your home."
1,I use it for listening to music when I'm trying to study. I use it to catch me up on news and also to turn off my lights. Great personal assistant wish it supported more applications/phone integration.
1,"Excellent addition to my wife's craft room for music and more...with her hands busy in the craft room, Alexa allows music choice and volume (and a lot more!) on a hands-free basis."
1,I love that my kids enjoy talking & interacting with Alexa. There are many games & activities my kids can enjoy with Alexa with her many skills.
1,"Can't find a better tablet for the price, Apple should take a page from the Amazon book"
1,We added this as part of our kitchen remodel and love its functionality
1,Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.
1,This device does a great job of streaming from all of your accounts.
1,"The ease of use is great, the features are great, Alexa Voice command works great, very pleased with the Amazon Fire Tv Box. AA"
1,Very easy for a child to useI bought this for my child. He's had no trouble navigating in learning the different tools to use to navigate through it.
1,"Great Tablet for a low price, it has a lot of bloatware but still worth it."
1,This is my second kindle but this one is light years ahead of my first. The refresh rate is so much quicker and the back light makes reading a pleasure. I prefer this to my IPad mini.
1,I loved it and then bought 2 of the dots for my daughters
1,My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
1,"I bought this item as a gift for my 15 year old niece for her birthday. She loves it and takes it with her almost everywhere she goes. Now that you can talk through it to use as a telephone it's even more fun to use. I was watching the prices go down and one weekend sale in April, Best Buy were practically giving them away, the online prices were so reasonable one weekend!!"
1,The glass on top of the reader is absolutely a slick and beautiful piece added on what is already an excellent device. Worth the extra $$$.
1,"This new kindle is so much easier to read than my second generation kindle that I had for years. It is faster, and the back-light can be adjusted easily to get the right amount of light for your reading pleasure. If you love books, you should get this."
1,I love this tablet. It's the perfect size for my kid. Keeps him entertained during long trips. We picked up the free time kid proof case and it's perfect also.
1,The best service ever and and knowledge of products
1,"The future is here, the best voice recognition I've ever used, along with intelligence and responsiveness."
1,I really enjoy the fire tablet I also have a iPad but the $50 you can't go wrong I bought 1 for each of my kids so they leave my iPads alone lol
1,Easy to use and great for the kids. Lightweight and easy to travel with.
1,It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
1,Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
1,Love my Fire TV Box. Works great and highly recommend if you are in the market for an android box!!
1,"Works great with good storage but, lacks online browsing speed."
1,This is a great product and it runs Android so you can install Kodi.
0,Bought this tablet for my daughter. It was very hard to figure out how to switch to the kids profile. She used it for maybe a day and when we went to charge it the cable just fell out and wouldn't actually charge.
1,This tablet is great for the kids. And it was cheap when I got it. Its recommendable for kids when they play games
1,The price on this tablet is unbeatable. The performance is above what we expected. If you are looking for something to use at home then this is it.
1,This is an excellent product. It will do everything expected and perform it well. Voice recognition is excellent. Great for people of all ages from 2 years old to 90 or more.
1,Great product would've given 5 stars only problem is that it kinda freezes at times after having it on standby for a few hours so I have to restart it from the menu settings other than that it's an awesome product
1,"So far so good. Didn't like the setup, but once got thru that everything is good."
1,A must have to cut cable. It's very fast and reliable.
1,"Family loves it. Kids use it to play favorite songs, we have it hooked up to lights and there is much more it can do."
1,Fun product to own. Not much guidance from store staff on product features.
0,Bought this tablet for my 4 yo and 9 yo. Tablet was perfect for their use of watching movies and kid games
1,Great product for the price!! I would recommend this to anyone!!
1,"So far, I am loving this tablet. Of coarse, it will take some time to fully learn all the good and bad aspects of this tablet. The screen is a little smaller than I thought. It has great apps. It's quick and smooth. Even sent me an email when I downloaded a free app. It offers a lot more options than the ipad that I've had for awhile. Looks like the ipad is on the way out."
1,"If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else."
1,"Not a 5 star. Has a few problems with remote not staying paired, low storage (upgradeable), buffering issues at times but overall not the worst thing out there."
1,This makes automation and. W built on speaker easier !!! Very good for hooking up to the HUE light system to help automate things. tech has come a loooong way !
0,It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on
1,great item for easy parental control... good size nice sounding speakers easy to use. but in a case asap!!! i bought more than one thank goodness... this item n the floor are not friends lol
1,Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
1,"This is a great tablet for its price but before you buy it just know it doesn't come with google play services so chrome, YouTube, And the play store aren't official apps you can download."
1,Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
1,This is by far the best stream box I own. Besides being a premium Amazon memeber makes this even better.
1,"Ok. So it's super cool being able to just talk to something that's right there in the kitchen and ask questions, set a timer, check the news or even listen to music. You just have to get over the freak out of who else might be able to listen in if hackers find a way!"
1,Works as advertised. easy to use and easy to read.
1,"Easy to use, easy setup, and nice interface. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,I like my Kindle. This device could be a later technology. For the price Amazon could include more features.
1,"works very well, small but not too small, very lightweright and paperwhite is very very very readale"
1,Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do.
1,So glad I purchased this productive it use it all the time
1,"This is the best tech device for the home. It keeps one company and communicates with the owner. It might be a life saver for the single person, the lonely elderly, and the young that likes new technology."
1,If you just want a tablet that gets the job done. Then here you go.
1,"Great product, very useful. Good speaker. Just like this product very much"
1,"This is the second Amazon tablet I have purchased and they both work very well. My 8 year old does his homework on the tablet. The screen is bright and clear, build quality is good and he is delighted with the number of games available"
1,Mostly music are paid subscription. Not started home automation like switch controls.
1,Very productive product naught for my daughter and she loves it
1,"Set up was easy. Plug it in, turn on the tv. Learning what channels I can see or not see is a learning curve. So far I am liking it but have to adjust to the changes moving away from cable."
1,Good deal. I recommended this tablet to several family members.
0,"Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it"
1,Love my new kindle fire. Gives me a tablet at a great price. Highly recommend this kindle
1,"Works better than expedited, speaker is amazing for its size"
0,"I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read."
1,From web searches to Kindle Books this sleek device does it all.
1,"Meets my needs for watching Hulu, Netflix, Youtube"
1,"Battery life is good, surprisingly awesome product with low memory. Lots to do with it/on it... very satisfied purchase"
0,It does what it is supposed to do. I wanted access to the internet to download books and didn't realize it would not do this feature. I would onIy recommend if a person only wants to read books from Amazon.
1,"This tablet works as intended. For $30 you couldn't go wrong with this purchase, Its fast and allows for additional storage via micro sd card. Great for the kids."
1,"Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now."
1,"My son was the first in the family to buy it. Then he introduced it to me, to his sisters and now we all having a great time enjoying the little box."
1,"Really like the voice commands, including commands outside the typical, movie/tv expectation (like the weather). Haven't used it as much as i thought i would, but set up (for the things i want to do) is fair...."
1,this tablet works great for my 5 year old who likes to watch kid videos. Set parental locks and it works just like any of the 125- 200 dollar tablets.... for $50... my kid is happy and I am happy
1,Purchased this as a gift for someone for Christmas. It's no iPad but you can't beat the price.
1,I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.
1,worth the price you pay for the product. thank you
1,I bought this to turn the light on in the bedroom when I have to get up during the night. Also works good for keeping shopping list and listening to music.
1,The Fire TV is everything I could have asked for in an entertainment system
1,"I take this on all my trips. I have access to,tons of books. I can carry it in my purse and read wherever I am."
1,I purchased the kindle fire for a vacation we were going on and really only thought i would use it for books and maybe a few games but was surprised at how well i was able to access the internet with it. the only thing that i can say negative about it is the sun glare. in the sun it is next to impossible to see what is on the screen. indoors or shade and it is fine
1,My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight
1,I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
1,"Having fun learning all that Alexa can do. Easy to program, even easier to use."
1,"This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps."
1,I like this tablet ...............................
1,Enjoy portability of this product. Great price too.
1,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She's an avid reader and doesn't get much time to do so. This was a perfect gift so she can travel with it.
1,Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
1,excellent for children school without breaking the bank
1,"This kindle is by far the best, really enjoy the weight of it and ease on the eyes while reading"
1,"OK for a entry level tablet, great screen for watching movies good HD images."
1,best of the best easy to set_upworks awesomeno problems
1,"I bought this main to give me control of my Echo in the bedroom. Works flawlessly. Love being able to turn off all lights in the house with a simple voice command before bed. ""Alexa, All lights off"""
1,I bought this as a Father's Day gift for my brother. He just connected it and thought it was an awesome gift!
0,After a week of using the Amazon echo I found myself using it less and less each day. I tried several times for it to do commands no luck. Save your money.
1,I looked at the reviews between the stick and the box. I choose the box because it connects to the Ethernet.
1,I love it it's an awesome electronic device I can't live with out it !
1,Once you learn how to use it you can have some fun with it plus it can be educational.
1,"We looked into tablets for three of our children for Christmas. There were three things we looked for: the ability to use it for books, games and videos and our ability to control the activity. The kindle fire gave us all those and more. I love that we can increase the storage when/ if we want to. I love that we can control play time. I was concerned because all of our kids were used to our iPad, but they have had no issues adjusting to the change. We are extremely happy with this purchase!!"
1,Very helpful and informative. Lots of fun to use. Would highly re
1,"This is my first time using any Amazon products, so far so good no complaints."
1,"This has the same pixel density as the $200 Kindle Voyage, the biggest differences being no pressure sensitive buttons and there isn't a glass screen flush with the bezel. The Paperwhite is the best value of the Kindle lineup."
0,I feel like I have been completely lied to about this device. Despite reviews claiming a hands free mode that does not exist in the settings. I just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hands free option to enable in settings. And Pandora said it's not available in the US on this Amazon tap. Thanks for ruining a birthday Amazon
1,"excellent quality, easy to use. perfect screen size and picture quality. Not slow at all. very efficient."
1,I liked the price and am very pleased with the apps that are available. My children semm to be very happy with the tablet and it is very user friendly.
1,The Echo is easy to use but some features require a lot of work. It is easy to set up for playing music. The other features(skills) require some study to get the most out of the product. After a few months I am still learning something everyday about the Echo. Long learning curve but a fun product.
1,This item was for the kids for Christmas. The Amazon FreeTime feature with multiple child user profiles is a great way to help balance learning and productive time with their fun time.
1,"PROS:1) What an ultra HD clarity. It is just awesome..2) Very easy interaction to navigate.3) Earlier I have used ROKU but after AMAZON FIRE TV stands miles ahead of ROKU in many positive ways.CONS:1) You can't use voice remote in many apps. Very few options to use voice search.2) Wifi signal receiver is very poor. Initially I used this on WI-FI and at that time it will keep on buffering and clarity was very poor. I contacted with AMAZON and raised as defect and got new one. Again same issue happened then I used it over ETHERNET port and then I realized the problem is with the WI-FI receiving capacity of this device. I placed my laptop near to my AMAZON device and took speed test it showed 25MBPS, even then clarity was very poor over WI-FI.Hence I would recommend to use this over ETHERNET connection."
1,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
1,"The screen resolution, ease of use, and access to apps, books, and movies makes the Kindle Fire hard to beat. This is the 5th Kindle we've purchased (big family) over the past several years - have been happy with each one."
1,"This is really a great product. Ask whats on your mind to Alexa, and she answers.We have enable many skills for echo, and all of them are very amazing.Wish it can have a context building module, which it can remember and build some context.Other than that this product is very good, volume and sound is superb, louder than portable bluetooth devices.I like the white color better than black color."
1,"The Alexa has been a nice addition to our home. Overall we have instant music, weather, a joke, and best of all the ability to set a timer. Works as expected, nothing more or less."
0,"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
1,"This product works better than the smart tv function of our current tv, simplifies the process and especially the search function. no more clicking and scrolling thru the alphabet...just speak it and let it search for you - that alone is worth the $"
1,This tablet was and still is I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet.
1,setting up was easy. no issues watching it or set up
1,"Our household is an Apple household (3 iPads, 4 iPhones, Mac, Apple TV etc) but for the price of these tablets I gave this a try. I had low expectations due to the price point and didn't expect much as far as screen resolution etc...Set up was easy, linked with my Amazon Prime account easily as well...screen resolution doesn't compare to iPad Retina display but that's expected....battery life is ok but not on par with iPad...I use it for Ebooks as its smaller than my iPads and for checking Facebook etc if it's nearby.It can't replace iPad BUT...I bought 4 of them so everyone in my house has this small, functional tablet....Might even permanently mount as small TV screens in bathroom etc..."
1,"Fast, lots of content. Right step towards cutting the cord."
1,We got it for travel purposes. We didn't expect much.
1,You couldn't ask for a better value. Does everything you'll ever need from a tablet and it is not some cheap knock off brand. Real deal for under fifty bucks? Can't beat it!
0,"This tablet is only about average, but it is fine for my grandchildren, they have lots of fun playing the games"
1,I bought this tablet for my 10 yo granddaughter and she loves it.
1,"I bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that I decided to get one for my ten year old. I thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative. She has responded surprisingly well. One feature that I really like is the dictionary. If she comes across a word she doesn't know or can't read, she can tap on it, and the dictionary will pop up defining the word. This enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better. This has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine."
1,"I purchased this for my 85 year old father, who is hard to gift for. So far he seems to enjoy it. I will be adding some additional smart devices to make it more useful (lighting, thermostat, etc.). I've run into a few hiccups - for instance asking driving directions doesn't work. Nothing major though - all in all, it's a good purchase!"
1,So happy we made the decision to cut the cord and move to Amazon TV!
1,I am very happy with my echo I will recommend it to all my friends and recommend they become a Best Buy member
1,I purchased 3 of these as christmas gifts for nieces & nephew.
1,solid build and battery can last for a month! even with backlid is on
1,Great for people that are not real tech savy easy to use...your
1,I bought this to replace my Nook since it was such a great deal..it did not disappoint. Great graphics sharp fun games and free apps.
1,We bought several for our employee party. I liked it so much I bought one for myself.
1,Great for my kiddo! He loves to watch Sesame Street on it :)
1,"Bought this for my grandson for Christmas, I also own one. We both like this product"
1,"Love it and it's accessible for the blind. Music, weather, jokes, sound effects, reads me books, she does it all."
1,I love reading my books on this kindle. a little slow on processing on the web.
1,Easy to use. Durable great material very happy with it.
1,Very nice tablet for the price. Fast and responsive
1,Great product very easy to use. Installed kodi on it and love it.
1,"Bought the Echo to use with my Alarm.com security system as a voice recognition interface. Did not expect to see my friends and family also buy one for other reasons. Great product, price too high!"
1,"This is my second Fire TV box, and it's a great upgrade from the first gen model I had. The buffer time is lightning quick, faster than my Roku. The 4K works well, and the Amazon ecosystem is actually more complete than what the Apple TV offers. Very happy with this purchase."
1,This was given to me as a gift and I have enjoyed it. I love the different skills you can add to it. Now my kids need the arch Dot because they try to take the Echo away from me. I brought my mom one and my uncle brought my aunt one and the love it as well.
1,"The best remote for the price you cannot beat it, easy to use"
1,"Works Great , Great Item , Easy to Use & Easy to Download"
1,"I also have a firestick but I gave the fire tv a try cause it's supposed to be faster and I can connect an Ethernet cable to it, and it delivered."
1,"reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use"
1,This tablet has all I need to enjoy using it. I bought it for the low price otherwise I may have waited to buy.
1,"This was easy to set up. Easier to have your Hue lights already in place and then run ""discovery"". I watched You tube videos before setting up and it was not hard at all. Need to download the free app Amazon Echo. It connected with Philips hue lights. To connect with my nest thermostat I needed the IFTTT app. (Echo sends your command via the IFTTT app to nest. Thinking about getting another for other room."
1,"Washer great size, Customer service was great, the sales person very nice and helpful."
1,Bought for my wife to read ebooks. She has done that and in addition is playing games on it.Very pleased.
1,I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
1,"We bought two. One for a university student, the other for an 11 yr old. No more waiting for books in the mail! Books are immediately downloaded. They are able to run Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Pandora etc not choppy, immediate loading. TToonnss of apps. Many free. They are surprisingly durable, more than my son's iPad. The battery life is good. Thinking about buying another."
1,"Works as any other kindle fire. Does have advertisements, but for $49, can't beat the price."
1,"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."
1,My husband loves it and so do I now that I understand how to work it You must start your question off by saying Alexa.......
1,This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.
1,My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
1,"Looking for a desent product , best buy had black Friday tablets for $34.99, what a great bargain. I had to buy four of them for my grandkids. Just the look on thier faces when they opened, was a great joy for me."
1,"My second Alexa, easy to set up and simple to use. Very pleased with purchase."
1,This was a gift for my niece's birthday. She loves it .Plus the kid safe
1,"I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read."
1,I purchased 5 and all were successful gifts ..... Thank you
1,This device is easy to setup very fast and provides a great quality picture.
1,Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.
1,This tablet was very reasonably priced and easy to use. I find that I am using it much more frequently than I thought I would. The only gripe that I have with it is that it's hard to download apps that are not Amazon connected. I'm still trying to get Dropbox for example.
1,Works well.
0,"This 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. I got mine on Black Friday for a little over $30. total with shopping discounts and I'm still sending it back! That's how disappointed I am with it."
1,i bought this last year for xmas love it so much I bought another and I also bought the hd version.
1,"Connects to anything lights, cameras if you have amazon prime there unlimited music"
1,Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.
1,I love my firebox so much I bought one for a friend!!! So much awesomeness with it!!
1,This is a great item for the family. Easy to use and lots of fun
1,They loved it and are always talking about their gift .
1,She's great... Very useful and out of the way... Going to get a DOT
1,"This little tablet is awsome for the price. Great for the kids too! Perfect for reading books, playing games, surfing the web. I am very pleased with my tablet! Will be buying more for gifts this holiday season!"
1,Great device for all your tv and movie streaming.Also this device can play games wow
1,This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.
1,"I purchased this table for my son to check email, watch movies and play games. He loves it!"
1,Loved the gift my daughter can't put it down kid friendly
1,"It's a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too"
1,"bought this as a friend to help her move from an ancient laptop to a simple tablet. The ""value"" of this product is very high."
1,Love the fire tv! It's is fast and very responsive. If you have Amazon prime this is a must!
1,Product works well but has more potential than is currently offered. A bit difficult to set up on households sharing a Prime membership. Lacks flexibility with your I tunes library unless you want to pay Amazon to access the songs you already own. Hopefully Amazon will get smarter. Highly recommend the product.
1,This is what I needed not fancy just simply used for reading books. Easy to use and battery lasts for quite a while.
1,Great tablet from Amazon! I works quickly and smoothly.
1,Excellent charging quality with heavy duty cord. Does not work on Kindle with a cover. Great value.
1,I have a kindle myself and love it so wanted to purchase one for my grandson's birthday. He's 11 yrs old and he loves it.
1,"What a device! Ask Alexie what time it is, how far it is from Pluto to Saturn or play some Buddy Holley, she does it all. Loads o f fun!"
1,"Tablet was easy to setup and use, bought for kids and they absolutely love it."
1,We purchased these Kindle Fires for a reading contest sponsored by our club for the local elementary schools. They make really great incentives for students to read more and are a relatively inexpensive way to do so.
1,"I purchased this tablet for my mom, and she loves it!!! She isn't the biggest person for tech like items. But I knew she would enjoy this item. She gets all her games, ebooks, apps, and more on this tablet. Plus it's easy to use and that's why she likes it so much, also i got it for a great price lol"
0,"This would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level Android tablet... but... it is impossible to play music from Google play on it. Only Amazon! That's ok, since is their business, but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it :(If you have a short budget and don't care about being attached to amazon only, this tablet is for you."
1,The echo was very easy to setup but took a little time to figure out proper phrases to control devices. What amazon downplays though is that this is more of a gateway and does not control devices without network.
1,"completely satisfied, and absolutely love it!!! definitely a great thing to have..."
1,I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas! He LOVES it and it has a great warranty!
1,Great tablet for a great price. No need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children
1,This is a fantastic product for music. Love it and would recommend it.
1,I enjoy Alexa. It is very helpful. The news flash briefing is my favorite. I love that the device continues to learn.
1,"It's fast ,well build would recommend for anyone who has young kids"
1,"I am building out a relatively large, advanced smart home and it was only natural to integrate voice assistant features to the mix. I use the Echo to control Phillips Hus lights and even my Schlage lock. Every morning I wake up and get news and weather from Alexa as I'm getting ready. What a wonderful product."
1,Originally purchased for my husband but it has since become our daughter's favorite device. She enjoys watching YouTube videos and playing games on it. Went without a case or screen protector for several months and we are very pleased with how durable it is.
1,I purchased this item for my 3 year old son. It's very durable because he drops it a lot on purpose but most importantly it has a ton of educational activities for him.
1,My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
1,"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good."
1,It has alex built in so you don't even need a amazon eco
0,It's good for lil kids n small stuff . Doesn't look very fast
1,"This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite."
1,great tablet for the entire family and very easy to use.
1,"I bought this tablet for watching movies and reading books. It is also a great tablet because I can set my children on their own individual side, and set up parental controls"
1,Great device really like the option to use either wifi or lan
1,I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
1,It is very user friendly device. MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT.
1,Great product! Easy to use! New update to the UI is really nice too!
1,love this newer kindle easier to read and brighter text
1,"Amazon Fire is an excellent choice and cost effective, havent had any troubles, it works perfect!"
1,Kids love these and use them not only as readers but as mini tablets. Great price very happy!
1,So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
1,Works good for price. My kid likes it very much. Good value for money
1,Very happy with this gift for my kids! Easy to use and it was a great deal!
1,Great device for reading indoors or outdoors. Very easy to navigate.
1,This thing is great! It connects to everything! Thank you Best Buy!
0,It's good but to get more connection and less buffing get the one with the Internet cable
0,Ok I need to learn how to use it I would recommend
1,"Amazon Echo so great, I have it running my air and lamps. performs great. Great product. Just ask a question and she gives the answer 99% of time correctly."
1,Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel.
1,"It is very light and easy to read. Nice backlight feature. Only issue we have had is we haven't been able to remove the ads that show up when you are not using your Kindle. They disappear when you are using it. I just don't like ads, especially when you pay for something."
0,Best Buy employees could have been more knowledgeable on this item
1,This unit with amazon prime is a blast! Use it to have fun dance parties...
1,This fire tv is awesome! Not only is it easy to set up and use but I'm saving a ton of money on cable :)
1,Like the fact that it is strictly an e-reader. Wished it was a bit larger like the Fire HD 8 tablet - but pleased with my purchase
1,This this works awesome with my hue light systems. I set up my weather and news to get daily info. The one minor trouble is that you have to make sure you anunciate so it doesn't misinterpret you.
1,"I really enjoy the Fire tablet. The only drawback is the short battery life. However, for $49, it's a great buy. In fact, I recommended it to a family member. If battery life were better, I would give it a 5 star."
1,Works very well and give us enjoyment to use when the family is around
0,I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking
1,"Okay this tablet has its limits. It's not an IPad. But for 50 bucks it does a lot. If you have Amazon Prime it's awesome. If you don't, it's still nice. It's fast and has good battery life. You can side load apps if you can't find them in the Amazon App Store. Overall I'm impressed with the features."
1,This device offers a wonderful way to read books without creating more clutter in your home. The device is also easy to read even in the sun (unlike by IPad mini).
1,I got this for directvnow Hulu cbs omg a lot of different apps it was time to cut the cord I love it
1,bought this tablet for a first time user the price was right the quality was good
1,"Brought this tablet for my 18 month old. Definitely worth it! He mainly uses it for learning games and YouTube kids TV. I'm thinking of buying one for myself in the future. It has a front face camera however it's only 2.0 megapixels, so picture quality isn't that great. But other wise you will be happy if you decide to buy this tablet."
0,"Battery life is great. Kindle unlimited is lame, web browser needs work."
1,"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
1,"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
1,"Great sound for such a small speaker, learns from what you tell it."
1,I got this for my birthday and love it. Sounds good for size and increasing functionality all the time.
1,I have two smart TV's. I use Fire TV more because it streams better and more reliably than the TV's.
1,"Love this item, it really is amazing what it can do."
1,Great buy my other blue tooth sound bar went out and I had to have something that would last and this is amazing it talks back and does whatever I need and you can't beat that so amazing echo is the way to go gonna have to get the amazon spot so if your in need of a great speaker and all the extras here it is
1,"The entire family enjoys this product. Provides music, weather, timer and viirtually anything you need to know. Great product!"
1,"I brought this as one of the wished for items for our Adopt-A-Family. It appeared to be a nice device for viewing email, social media, and entertainment."
1,Bought it to read and I couldn't resist the great price.
1,Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
1,I purchased this tablet for my son to use after realizing he took mine over almost completely. He has no problems navigating from game to game. Excellent speed and love the HD screen.
1,"I was looking for a product that was affordable and easy to use, this was the perfect product"
1,"We still have one of the original Kindles, and the upgraded features on the new Kindle are great: being able to change the brightness, able to read it in the dark, seeing page numbers in addition to % completed. This Kindle seemed easier to use and more intuitive than the original."
1,"I got this for my kid, because it is tailored for kids. They liked it and it worked."
1,Great tables for kids. I haven't had any issues with them
1,Great product .I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
1,Works flawlessly with amazon users especially those with prime accounts.
1,Works flawlessly and love it. Great options and apps.
1,"Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed."
1,"Durable case, easy to use. My grandkids watch nursery rhymes and play educational games. I've seen the youngest stand on the Fire and it is still perfect"
1,"My son has the Hd fire used for last 3 years, I bought this one for my moms birthday. She loves it. It's easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price :)"
1,"Great gift, easy to set up and very user friendly."
1,"Gave this as a gift to someone who didn't think they'd want one, with in a week they were in love with it. Easy setup to use with your library card."
1,This tablet is extremely easy to use. There are a wide selection of books and apps available.
1,Love Alexa! She is very helpful and was very easy to set up. She learns new skills everyday.
1,I bought this for my parents. It works like a charm.
1,I wasn't sure I would like it because I didn't know all that it could do. I am very pleased with my amazon echo and I am very happy I brought it.
1,Bought this tablet for a seven year old to use for YouTube videos and Netflix. It has been a good buy for this beginning tablet user.
1,Love the echo. Purchased for my mother in law for Christmas. We have had our own for about a year now.
1,We had one and it was broken so I purchased another one.
1,I have recently purchased a 4K tv and wanted to get the best experice out of watching anything this fire tv has great screen quality and sound with no delays
1,"Alexa is awesome. She controls the lights in the house, keeps me up to date, and dressed for the weather. I enjoying discovering what else I can do with her. Ask her who is the fairest of them all!"
1,"i adore my echo...i wake up in morning, get a quick weather, sports scores...and here in florida, i get to listen to my favorite nyc sports radio stations...i use it to access my music...and i recently purchased a audio book for the wife, and i am waiting until i give her that audiobook for xmas; the i can ask alexa to read it to me ! ... i am sure alexa does so much more...(i even asked it to convert to metric for me when i was cooking last week)...i do not have any smart devices in my house, so i havent had the opportunity to have alexa do that for me...but it is so much fun to use...and now, instead if reaching for laptop to google something...i just ask alexa first"
1,"Great Kindle, the only complaint I have so far is that it does NOT have a charging light, so that you know when it is charging, or when it is fully charged."
1,I could not be happier with my purchase. The channel options are great. Very easy to navigate around menu.
1,The light is adjustable and easy on the eyes. A great way to read without disturbing your partner.
1,My kids each got one of these for Christmas. They like them much better than their Kindles
1,"This item, the Amazon Fire tablet, is a great buy for the price."
1,"The Echo has great sound and responds well to voice commands. I have not tried out all of the features yet, but so far I like it."
1,"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
0,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
1,I bought this as a gift and they wwere very pleased
1,Easy to tell Alexa to play my Spotify list! Also great for weather and news.
1,This tablet has great graphics compared to the base android. I bought the kids protective case to use when the grandkids come over. Long battery life.
1,Had the fire stick but I just bought a 4K tv and upgraded the Netflix to stream 4K. Loved the fire stick so much only made sense to buy the fire tv box. It's super easy to use. Great interface.
1,"I bought this for my son, He really loves it for reading and playing Games."
1,Purchased the Echo as a bridal shower gift. My niece and her fianc are still learning about all it can do but already reported back to me that they love it. I was told it is the most favorite gift they received.
1,"I'm am not real good with computers but this is simple enough for me to use however I am still figuring everything out on it, so far so good."
1,The products works as advertised and has been satisfactory to this point. It is somewhat complicated but if the instructions are followed closely there are no problems.
1,Friendly to use . Size was perfect and easy insts.
0,"So, its ok. I mean, it's not as fast or as seamless as the Apple TV, but it's cheaper. This is my 2nd one. The first one bricked after 15 months of steady use, so because the warranty was expired I bought a new one. I got it home and the remote stopped working for it on the 2nd day. I had just spent a week going back and forth with Amazon trying to troubleshoot my bricked firebox so I wasn't about to delve back into the quagmire that is Amazon customer service. I ended up just downloading the remote app for it instead. If you're a prime member it's a good choice, but if your not just get an Apple TV or roku."
1,"Can be dropped, thrown and doesnt break. awesome tablet"
1,"I like how it works. It works well, I just don't like having to pay for everything."
1,love the access to amazon and the ability to communicate with alexa
1,Good product and good price. Have enjoyed it since Christmas and cant wait to read on it every evening
1,I wish it had 3G or 4G. Other than that it is great.
1,"Just purchased to replace my regular firestick. The system runs faster, better processor. It can handle the games alot better then the firestick. The voice remote is a cool add on. If you dont play games i wouldnt really reccomend upgrading to the fire tv box, just get the firestick. Hdmi and router cable arent included. The wifi actually worked better then when it was plugged in. Not sure why. Good purchase..I would recomend this over the chromecast or apple tv anyday."
1,It's a very good one for my children to play with so
1,The screen is clear and great for playing games and watching videos.Doing homework is easier
1,i bought this and i really enjoy using it. fits my needs.
1,Learning how to stream movies from Netflix and my amazon prime my wife and I are really enjoying my fire tv.
1,"Tablets can get expensive, this one is pretty much everything you want in a tablet, but not for an outrageous price. Being Amazon, they make it user-friendly as long as you know what apps to get."
1,"Tablet has many features. Great Tablet for reading, storing your resume, surfing the web and downloading books. The price is amazing"
1,I love the Amazon Fire. It's very similar to other tablets without the heavy price tag.
0,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
1,Really surprised at what this little tablet can do. I am starting to use it more than my iPad. Easier to take on vacation (smaller footprint). More comfortable to hold while reading books online.
1,Gave this as an early bday gift for a friend that hooked me on eReaders. The improvements to the time it holds a charge and screen size are awesome!
1,Way faster than the fire stick. I hook up to my Garage TV to watch live boxing from the ShowTime app. Plus many more apps. Have Prime subscription but not necessary in my opinion.
1,I enjoy using my amazon echo. I love how Alexa can turn off and on my lights lol
1,Bought this device for my dad. It is fairly simple for games and internet use.
1,"Get lots of apps and shows with a speedy menu, nice quality of the streams from Netflix and Amazon. Great purchase."
1,"This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end."
1,"We enjoy all the music we can get with just ""Hey Alexa"". Definitely worth the money."
1,This was purchased as a gift for our Grandson. He is 8 yrs old and has played games on it almost constantly since receiving it. It has many free games available to play on it.
1,I bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. As I had a limited budget I needed something under $50. The Amazon Fire fit the bill and more. I don't know how Amazon can make money at this price point. Fantastic value!
1,Cheap device running Amazon's OS. No problems installing apps or using the device. Highly recommend for $49.99 (or $33.33 during Black Friday).
1,Easy to set up had all the channels I felt it was less clunky than roku
1,My Godson loves his new tablet. It's fast and there are a lot of free academics and games available to download.
1,I bought it it works. What's else do you want. Yes I would get another one if needed
1,This gizmo is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the Alexa world!
1,We are very happy with our new Alexa product. We are so happy that we have been calling our daughter daily with new ideas on how to use it. This has prompted her purchase one as well.
1,I have an Echo. I thought so well of it that I gave this one to my son.in.law
1,"My kids loved it, they were able to learn how to use it right away"
1,The paperwhite kindle has excellent resolution and makes reading easy on the eyes.
1,"Easy to use, easy to read the screen, light weight."
1,Easy to set up and use. Great tablet for a non-techy!
1,"Love this gadget. Plays music, makes grocery list, tells me the weather reports"
1,"Originally bought the fire stick, worked but not nearly as good as this. Worth the extra money."
1,Easy to use and has some great features. Useful for both kids and adults
1,Perfect size reader. Beautiful screen for video viewing
1,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all
1,I really enjoy this tech item. Great buy! It's kinda cool to be able to give all types of commands and see them occur.
0,"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight. Not worth the $179.00 and I feel it's slated to go the route of the Pet Rock (for those who remember it)."
1,Cannot beat any amazon product. Especially the firetv box. Way faster
1,"Able to surf the net and facebook, but slow in those apps and you get all notifications that occurred since the last time you were on your Kindle even if you checked your facebook notifications prior to using the kindle. Excellent for its purpose of readING only. Which is why I bought it."
1,I would have given 5 stars but my unit refuses to wake up when I hit button on remote. I have to pull the plug to power unit up. Hopefully Amazon will resolve this issue.
1,Bought 3 tablets .one already broken my 5 year old Grandson washed his he did not know any better but the other to are fine Thank You they love them.
1,Love how I can continue to read outside in the sun
1,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mom and she seems to be enjoying it.
1,"Upgraded from the old Kindle with the keyboard, and wish I would've done it sooner. Beautiful screen, nice and light, perfect in every way. The best way to read a book."
0,It works great with my Hue and also requesting music. But deeper questions it doesn't know much
1,"I utilize my Tap on my bedside table for wake up calls, playing rain sounds to help me go to sleep, set reminders for the middle of the night uh-ohs and play my fav music. I take my Tap to work with me as a cordless battery bluetooth speaker . . . best of both worlds."
1,My sister in law needed a new tablet so the amazon was a good choice. I also got one for my mom and dad.
1,"It probably does just as much as more expensive tablets and it's easy to use. The 7"" screen is a bit small but does make it easier to take anywhere."
1,"Can't beat this product for the price. Good screen quality and decent speed. Cameras aren't that great but it's not really for pictures. Overall, a great product!"
1,i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good
1,We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.
1,"Does just about everything you could need or want a handheld to do. Plays games, surfs the web, Skypes, etc. with ease. For the price have such a powerful system and vibrant colored screen is unheard of. Very pleased."
1,"Must have for people who have an Amazon Prime account and an Echo. Portability and water resistant. Works great by the hot tub or pool, and let's you access the normal Alexis capabilities."
0,"I don't know how to use this stupid tablet, but my kids sure love it. We've downloaded games and movies for the kids, and they seem to be fairly entertained by the darn thing. We bought one for Christmas, and ended up getting a second one so the kids stop fighting."
1,I use it all the time for Television. It works quickly and has good quality.
1,Great sound..exploring it's smart home capabiliies
1,This is a great tablet for the price. Skip all the other cheap tablets and get a kindle. You won't regret it.
1,Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.
1,We love our Amazon television box we want to order another one
1,"This tablet is less than $50 and is an outstanding little tablet. The only negative I could bring up about it is that it is geared towards selling you stuff from Amazon. It does books, web surfing, and apps quite well though. It is well worth the money and putting up with the advertising."
1,"Read lots and lots of reviews before purchasing, glad we did, the whole family loves Echo. Music works great, better than expected sound given the small footprint. We don't have a connected home yet but look forward to adding these features."
1,"We Love our Alexa, she keeps all of our appointments and plays great music and keeps us up to date on weather and news."
1,I would highly reconmnd this product to anybody. I use it on a daily basis
1,Love it would recommend to my friends and family .
1,For the price this works fine as a reader. I had the original Fire and was disappointed when it quit charging. I'm hoping that I don't have the same problem with this.
1,Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better
1,Good for toddlersEasy to carryEasy to download
1,This is a great product. Alexa never lets you down !
1,I've purchased a number of these for my grandkids and other family members! They are easy to navigate and have great speed!
1,Small enough to fit into a small bag. Wonderful to use to pass the time when waiting for transportations and appointments and the paperwhite can be used in low level lighting. It is easy to use.
1,"With the capability of apps and other things, my kids don't even touch my computer, this thing does everything."
1,Great product great price wold recommended this great gift
1,I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
0,This item was a gift. I've heard that it was a great product for the value. Recipient loved it.
1,"I got it for my mom, That's all I have to saythanks"
1,Everything I thought it would be and more. You need Amazon prime to really unlock the potential it has but it's a great buy for a great price!
1,Great speaker and Alexa is so awesome. Great price
1,It does perform functions as it is supposed to. It would be nice if it would play more than one song on command to do so. Also would be nice if it had a head phone jack.
1,I have a roku tuner and am not impressed with iy. I find the amazon tuner much easier to find programs.
1,"this is my first foray into purchasing a reader...I reviewed multiple sites and opinions before I made a move on this purchase...and not disappointed, can read anywhere in any light"
1,"We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!"
1,"Alexa can definitely be useful with creating shipping lists, entertaining guests, and integrating into a smart home. If you have young children it can be a little frustrating as they tend to compete for controlling the device and there is no way to have Alexa ignore a command given to it.Specialty command lines can be confusing if you don't get the studying right.Overall, it is useful for most things and the music services it connects to allow for a wide variety of entertainment."
1,"I had previously purchased the first kindle fire for reading but I would get distracted with all those other apps you can get on it. When the kindle paper white came out I decided I’ll give it a try. I love reading in the dark with it and that it looks like the pages in a physical book. I also love the word wise it helps to review words you didn’t know later if you want, growing your vocabulary."
1,Very easy to use. I bought it for my 6 year old. Quality and ease of use is really great. Would recommend buying this first before getting an ipad for your child.
1,Brought for my wife . She loves it. She spends a lot .
1,I bought the Echo based on a suggestion from a relative... it's got some nice features and the 'easter eggs' are fun to find. Sometimes I feel like I have to yell at it for the Echo to hear me and there's a large amount of stuff that it doesn't know (Amazon is working on that). I would definitely recommend getting a Dot as well if you are placing the Echo more than 5 feet from where you'd normally be talking to it from.
0,"this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
1,"I love the Echo. Good speakers, great reminder and note taker. While listening to the radio while cooking dinner I also use it for a timer. It sits on my counter, taking up very little room. Love it!"
1,"I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook!"
1,Got this as a gift forMy son as he wanted to have Netflix in his room.
1,Great to have - love the back lit and font changes. It's perfect for travel and reading in bed - so light weight.
1,"great for elementary and middle school, use for educational apps and web browsing"
1,"I have only had this Echo for a short time, but use it all the time! So fun!"
1,Recommend to anyone interested.....................
1,I use Alexia every day to turn on lights (zwave) and change channel on my TV (logitech harmony hub). I have a few DOTs around the house too.
1,My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
1,Gave this as a gift. Grandson loves it. We liked the low price.
1,it very easy to work and does very good good games my child loves it he not but 4 and finds his way around on it
1,"For 50 dollars you cant REALLY complain, it actually will take a drop pretty well too."
1,"It's a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster."
1,I am enjoying the Tap very much. Lot's to do and play with on the app. Still finding new things it can do daily. Great sound quality to play my music. I only wish that it had a better search engine.
1,Love this product ...good sound and easy to use !!
1,"The 7"" amazon fire tablet has came along way since the kindle version. This is a full android tablet loaded with many great features. Price range makes it excellent for kids too."
1,"I like every thing about the tablet size , color, takes good picture's"
1,Good for A lot of things. Listen to news briefs in the morning. Hooked up my lights to it. Great product
1,"So here was my dilemma, I could buy a cheap tablet from a no name manufacturer and suffer lag time, battery problems, software problems and all the things the bad reviews said or I could buy(on sale) an Amazon Fire Tablet and get a great screen, great battery life, Alexa, wifi, access to my Amazon Prime goodies and an easy to us OS..hmmmm, which way should I go? Needless to say, thrilled with my Fire tablet, use it all the time and wondering why anyone needs to spend more when this thing does so much for so little."
1,"It was very easy to set up. We are still in the learning stages of usage, so far it's quite exciting, can't wait to use it more"
1,"Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I'm still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month."
1,This device has been amusing and entertaining and it works well
1,This is my third Kindle - they just keep getting better.
1,Tablet is for my 2 year old son and it has great learning game so for him! He's learning to read and so much more!
1,"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
1,"Amazon TV Box has got to be best bang for the buck. No other devices can match performance and price this offers. Great for gaming, movies, shows, and overall android platform."
1,I have had one before and I like the new camera feature on this one. Easy to use and the clear picture.
1,Product is much better than the original- highly recommended
1,The echo was easy to set up and interface with all my smart lights and outlets. It's quicker to get the weather through the echo than it is to go on line for it. It does an amazing job in understanding what I am asking for and finding the answer.
1,"I get amazing streaming quality and speed, love the voice activated controller"
1,The bigger screen it so much better to do anything on. Games and movies are better because you can actually see them.
1,Love not having to carry books and being able to get a variety of books.
1,Good tablet for the price and for the kids to use. Can do a lot of the things they like and they can use it for school
1,The tablets and the cases are perfect for my grandkids.
1,"Great little tablet. It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate through different apps at first, but overall very pleased!!"
1,This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.
1,"Bought this with the intent for using it mostly for music, and now we use it to get news updates, weather, and the occasional joke. Kids love playing with it too, so it is nice to have the mute button."
1,Very happy with purchase. Would refer to others to buy.
1,Alexa is fun! I like that she turns out our lights. My kids love her corny jokes.
1,Works great! Purchased as holiday gift for 80 year old grandmother.
1,"What can I say since having the amazon Echo (Alexa) at home my family enjoys it. My kids do math questions with her and animal game, reading, history etc. And then there'sthe fun time were we ask her jokes play music ask silly question and so on. I definitely would recommend her to everyone."
1,"Easy to use, not overpriced. You get what you pay for."
1,"It's very easy to connect devices, and it produces a good sound. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,"I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it's purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don't need them so I don't use them and it's not a big deal for me."
1,"Works perfect, very accurate. Love every aspect of this machine. Great sound."
1,Stay charged for a long tine. Prefect size for young kids.
1,It is very user friendly and worked well for my travel needs!
1,"Easy to setup, customizable, and affordable android box. Highly recommended for your android needs."
0,i mean if you want just a tablet to read some books and browse internet thats fine.
1,"It is easy to use and have a huge selection of books, I recomend it"
1,Was looking for a 4k streamer and was trying to decide between the Roku 4 or this. I had recently ditched my cable and got Playstation Vue for my programming and this allows shows to stream at 60fps. If you get this I also strongly suggest cutting your cable cord and getting Playstation Vue also because this streams sports better than any of the others
1,Love the kindle fire. WI'll be buys kids one for Christmas
1,Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
1,Great for children to play games and watch videos.
1,"The Amazon Fire TV system was very easy to set up. I was actually surprised at how little the box was, and just how awesome the apps and downloadable games were that you can be use on the Amazon Fire TV. I ordered all my Amazon Fire TV apps online at Amazon and Google Play Store. I am an Amazon Prime and Google Play Store member. I bought this for one reason, and that's Kodi, it's an awesome app for Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick, and for the sd card reader on Amazon Fire TV it's easy to install and get up and running. The Fire TV doesn't have any issues that I can't fix, and the controls and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth. Also the voice control works wonderfully. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to cut the cable."
1,Bought on a whim because it was at Prime Day pricing. Pretty cool. Still getting used to all its features. Nice that it gets updated very often.
1,I had ordered my brother the Echo dot and mom mentioned she would like one also! What a hit! My parents love talking to Alexa!
1,"This 7 inch tablet exceeded my expectations and then some. I was apprehensive about having advertising on the wake-up screen, but with a simple swipe of the thumb it goes away with no waiting. It streams Netflix and UV copies from Flixster with zero lag and no buffering. Expandable memory, (Micro SD). This is basically an android tablet, so if you have experience using that platform, you will have no trouble navigating the settings menu, etc. There is no Google Play store access, however, the Amazon App store is available and is pretty impressive. The resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. One of my complaints with my old tablet was the visibilty when viewing at an angle, but this tablet does not have the same issue. All in all, this $50 tablet is the best value I have seen, as it outperforms the dual core $250 tablet I just replaced. If you are looking for a 7 inch tablet, you can NOT go wrong with this one."
1,"I have a connected home. Specifically smartthings. This gives me voice control over everything and I love it! The music is an added bonus. I plan on purchasing more, in the form of the echo dots for each room!"
1,I got the Fire Stick and had to return it because of the lag. Not enough RAM to run smoothly. The Fire TV however is great. It runs plenty fast and being able to Bluetooth sound to an external speaker is awesome. I rarely use my tv speakers any more. I highly recommend the fire tv!
1,"I had the smaller version of this & was looking to get rid of it & my google nexus. This is just what I wanted, it uses my Amazon prime account & takes a memory card so I can load it with all my videos I watch while at the gym."
0,Ok for a younger teen. Mediocre product. Still worth the sale price.
1,I really like the way my account gets point for how cool the purchase was!
1,I don't give anything 5 stars...nothing is or will remain perfect. I got one for a birthday in 2015. It was easy to set up and works like a charm. This last Christmas I bought an Echo and a Dot for gifts. I set them up for them and they love them. I like Amazon products... we own 3 kindles as well.
1,"Absolutely love it, speaker quality is terrible compared to other dedicated bt speakers but does keep this from being a 5 star"
1,My son seems more than happy with his B'day gift!! He loves it!!
0,Video files transferring issue. Some files appear.
1,This is good item to watch program with out all expense
1,Item works as advertised. Need to understand apps to get full use.
1,Got it on a Black Friday deal.... couldn't be happier
1,"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem."
1,Great product rooted with custom ROM. Slim ROM on XDA.
1,"This was a girl for my husband, he loves it! Great sound & picture"
1,Alexa continues to get better with every new update
1,"If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you"
1,"The tablet is good, the kids enjoy it, and is easy to use but the camera could be a bit more upgraded but for the price its a great deal."
1,"I had a kindle years ago and decided to try one again. I'm so glad I did!! The lighting seems to make it easier for me to read and see the words without my reading glasses!!I with I could put my own screen saver on it, and wish best buy carried the cases in colors!!"
1,i use it for reading books and news it has a great screen
1,"I have the Apple tv in one room and this in the other. Both are great boxes, but I must say this things absolutely flies when watching amazon instant videos. Almost zero buffering time even on 4K videos."
1,It's a very cool device to have and control home items by voice. It's limited to its capabilities but updates to include things you wish it did like the recent add to calendar reminders and alarm. Love cutting on my lights on by voice (beats the clap on lol). It does have a hard time of hearing sometimes and I have to repeat myself and holler sometimes like its my kids.
1,Got this tablet for my 10 year old son. It works great as a basic tablet. It was parental controls. He likes to watch moves on it in the car. Easy to use!
1,"The fire tv is a great, reliable product. I have several including the fire stick. I can't say enough good things about them"
1,I bought this as a gift for my daughter who was happy to get it.
1,"This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon's sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good"
1,YouTube plays only in the desktop version not the mobile version
1,This is my second fire I used last one all the time between grandkids and myself time to pass the old one down for them to use.
1,This box works great. It sure would be nice if it had the Google play store on it.
1,MThere are so many cool features and it's really easy to use.
1,I bought the echo for its music abilities and the ability to listen to the radio. My only wish is that amazon finally allows amazon music to be played as an alarm.
1,Easy to download app & set up. Pairs perfectly with the Philips Hue.
1,Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
1,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly."
1,"Amazon echo is an amazing device, and turns my house into a smart home as I use my voice for various commands like switching on lights, controlling window blinds, just to name a few. Buying this device is a no brainer!"
1,Good tablet for general use. Easy to add apps. Good battery lifetime.
1,"We've had a great time with Alexa. For entertainment, and for smart home uses. She remains an infant and I'm hopeful for expanded technology. It's going to be a must have in the future."
1,The Amazon Fire Tablet does everything that I need it to do and for the fraction of the price of other tablets on the market. Screen size and weight are both great.
1,Love it working good no lag or anything best gift I have so far
1,It's a great item I can hands free use. The best is when I need to add something to a shopping list. I can ask her and not worry about finding paper I may/will loose
1,works well; great sound. wife needed a second one for her office.
1,Love it! Replaced my google chrome stick with the fire stick
1,"It was easy to use, very nice picture and the quality is out standing, it is a little hard to hold but if you put it on the table it is a lot easier to use I would like to buy another one some day maybe upgrade to a different kind but overall it is worth the money that you pay for it"
1,I really like this Amazon Tap. I use the 'Happy Hour' skill in my private bar room for mixing drinks and I the portability plus 8+ hour battery is great. I also use to stream my music from the Amazon Prime Music library. I would recommend this to anyone.
1,I have owned all the past generations of fire stick and this blows them out of the water.
1,"At Times, I Just Want To Look Things Up-Watch Things-News etc etc-It's Perfect-On the Go."
1,Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
1,I like this tablet. I am still figuring out some of the options available on it.
1,"This is a great tablet at a affordable price!! It's perfect for the kids and as well for adults, what you waiting for? Go to Best Buy and get one!"
1,Great item! my grandchildren have had a ball with this!
1,"i bought the kindle fire 7 for a media source for my music since it was cheap, the only problem i've found so far is there isn't a good music player to download, if anyone knows of a good one please comment if possible. i also use amazon music app. i wish this had bluetooth capabilities but for $50 it can be forgiven..probably a good tablet for kids, i wish i would've just bought a samsung, asus, or lenovo tablet instead but really this is pretty good"
1,"This device is fun and entertaining, easy to use ."
1,"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
1,"good deal. but i hate that because i buy tax exempt, that best buy doesnt give me the reward points anymore. that sucks!"
1,Purchased as a secondary tablet to my iPad so that I could have an inexpensive one to use that I didn't have to worry about ... Easy to set up & has great speed.. Like that it has expandable memory!
1,Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn't broken it either.
1,"The device works OK. The more you use it, the better it works for you. We had some problems getting to link to our MLB account during the recent WS, but hopefully that will get worked out. AMAZON version of SIRI for the house."
1,Love this tablet. I purchased one for my elderly mother and she is able to use it. Real easy set up and has many apps already ready to go when you turn it on.
0,"There were many questions unanswered, I think apple Siri is better."
1,"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time."
1,The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
1,i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.
0,"I read reviews before making a decision for my purchase, but ended up returning the device as I was expecting an experience like that of an Android tablet."
1,Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.
1,"Brought this from QVC due to value payments & i love it! I use it to listen to the radio, yes you can listen to radio stations local & from all over the country by using one of the free apps. I get my weather, movie times, tell's me where a zip code or area code is, turns my lights on & off. I can order things from Amazon, check my Capitol One credit card balance & even pay on it etc. What more can a lazy person ask for?"
1,Great product for the price. Purchased this for a Christmas exchange and was the most popular item.
1,We bought this tablet for our son and there were a lot of free downloadable educational games and apps. Amazon also gave us $25 to purchase apps and ebooks!
1,Easy to set up. Easy to use perfect for playing music on demand
1,I don't have the other products to go with this so we use it for a room stereo. Produces nice sound and you control using voice commands.
1,I really like this product. It's easier to read when I'm eating because I don't have to hold a book and turn the pages. Basically I have both hands to eat with and only need to tap the screen to turn the page. I will say though the battery seems to drain a lot faster when you are using the wifi and looking up books or just searching the web. That would be the only bad thing about it I would say. Other than that it is an awesome purchase
1,This is my second Kindle Paperwhite I have bought at Best Buy. I wouldn't be without it and take it everywhere I go. The first one just wore out as I had it for several years. I have noticed new additions from the previous one which really helps.
0,"I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help."
1,This is a great reader and has lots of new features. Go with Kindle Paperwhite.
0,Very slow to connect to internet even with a good connection and wifi set up that worked for other electronics.
1,THe tablet with an added protective case has so far held up better than other tablets I have tried and the parental controls are great. I can also add educational apps that I want.
1,"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
1,The Amazon Fire is one of my go to prizes for work incentives. It is a lower cost a key that works great and has a name brand.
1,"I think this is faster and more reliable than the firestick, no drop outs"
1,"Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag."
1,"Glad I made this purchase, limitless in potential for automation through out the house, great entertainment tool."
1,"I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
1,"I was not to knowledgeable about this product but knew I wanted to buy it. While I'm cooking a meal I just ask ""Alexia, what is the current news"". Then I get the the latest news for 10 minutes. Then I ask ""Alexia, Pandora"" and I'm singing to my favorite songs while my meal bakes. Wow, I just love the technology and still learning what I can do with Alexia."
1,I use it for reading and I love it! I could take it anywhere.
1,Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.
1,"I enjoy being able to google information, check the weather, traffic, and playing music all by just asking Alexa."
1,Amazing battery life and beautiful screen. My friend I are all like it.
1,I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.
1,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
1,We purchased 2 of these for our children. They find them easy to use
1,My Husband loved his birthday present...Alexa. He has to learn how to asked for the information correctly or you get what you actually asked her. Lots of fun information at his fingertips.
1,I absolutely LOVE my new Kindle! I'll never run out of good books to read again! Best Buy had it delivered 3 days before I even expected it to arrive. Couldn't be happier
1,"I had the old Version of the Kindle and loved it. But now that I have the Paperwhite, i realize what a good decision it was to trade up. The contrast is like reading a real book and it doesn't hurt your eyes to read it for a long time."
1,"The family uses Alexa on a daily basis. She plays music, reminds us of tasks and even helps with cooking recipes. All around great product!"
1,Excellent Partner. My daily assistance on all aspects of living.
0,"The Fire 7 has a great price! You get your money's worth. However, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. The one I bought had a busted pixel in the screen. There was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable."
1,I got this for Christmas and love reading books on it. You get no glare and my eyes do not get tired. I previously used an ipad which was too bright and tired out my eyes. This reminds me of the real papers from a book.
1,Great price for a starter tablet. Easy to use and able to watch video and read books. Only downfall is poor external speaker if not using headphones.
1,"I bought this Amazon fire not for myself but for my cousin who lives in Mexico, he loves it I added movies/music and he said sound is great and it's perfect for school and for research"
1,These are things are awesome. I have two now. I highly recommend this over the fire stick version. I have a fire stick that I only use when traveling.
1,"I think this is a great ereader, I think even better than the Oasis that just came out. I do like that one but I love that this one seems sturdier and offers the automatic brightness adjustment and the vibration feedback when turning pages. One thing I didnt like was that it was hard to find where the page turn areas were at while reading in the dark. To remedy this, I bought a few aluminum button stickers and put them on the lines of the device"
1,I love my kindle. Bought this one for my mother in law. Plan on putting her on my Amazon account then we can share books. This way she will always have books to read and not have to pay for them. Luckily we like the same authors.
1,Use for entertainment only. It works GREAT. Best option for those that don't want to spend so much for an I Pad.
0,It was a great product but I purchased it for the Slingbox app. Last week it just stopped working on all my Amazon Fire Sticks and Fire TV. They say they are working on it but it has been about a week with no resolution. I am not the only one with this issue it seems to affect them all. Before that it worked very well. Better than expected. Not sure if they are going to get this fixed or not. If they get his fixed I would rate it a 4 to 5.
1,It is so much fun. Even helps kids with their spelling homework.
1,Bought the kindle for my daughter and it's has been wonderful to help define words as she is going. It is also nicely compact for easy travel from place to place.
1,"Great for kids use, not a lot of internal storage so a memory card is useful"
1,This was a very good purchase. It is really easy to use.
1,Purchased 3 of these for the kids for Christmas and had to come back and get one for myself as well! Awesome product
1,"I'm in love with my new echo. I own a multitude of wireless Bluetooth speakers that I have used in my garage while working for years. Simply comparing audio quality, I prefer the echo over my UE boom, which was my absolute favorite until this point. It doesn't have quite the bass the boom does, but it makes up for it in clarity, volume and bass responsiveness. Other than being a great speaker on its own, it's a fantastic task companion. The echo is set with every normal task you would ever need, and then some. I would happily buy another if anything were to ever happen to this one."
1,Use mainly to listen to music through Amazon prime.
1,I would definitely recommend this product for it's sound and quality!
0,Compared to the initial kindle this is a big impovement. Great for the Black friday promotional price.
0,This product is very easy and light to use. Love it.
1,"Excellent product, works really well...love it...."
1,Bought 3 for different and after 3 years mine went kerplot gona get new upgraded one for Christmas this year
1,"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
1,"I purchased the Amazon Echo to augment my other smart devices. Boy, has it made me lazy. Gone are the days when I'd have to stretch my arm out ALLLLLL the way to the lamp on my nightstand to turn it off. The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple ""Alexa, turn off my nightstand"" and ""Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am"" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights"" and ""Alexa, play my favorites playlist."" You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life. Amazon is working on it though - I receive weekly emails about new things you can do with Echo."
1,It is an awesome tablet. I purchased one for my granddaughter for Christmas.
1,Bought echo at my store and was very exited however it's not what I expected... overall it's good but not for my lifestyle
0,I was a loyal Roku 3 but since I got a 4K tv I wanted something that streamed 4K. The Fire TV has a lot of good qualities but the fact it constantly resets randomly is frustrating for sure. I have the highest speed internet via Comcast so I don't understand why it's doing that.Amazon prime is great so it's not bad just need the bugs worked out for a higher rating from me.
1,The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad
1,Bought this reader for my mom for mother's day and she loves it
0,The unit works good and understands you easily. Just not sure how much it can really do. The music quality is middle grade compared to other speakers.
1,"Similar to the TV program Jeopardy, you need to ask Alexa the question in the proper manner."
1,Easy to setup and use. Tons of apps and games to choose from.
1,I've bought nearly every model of Kindle Fire since they came out. I love the fact that this model allows the installation of a micro SD card for storage of photos and music. The color is also a plus! Much better than basic black. Glad I bought it!
1,The Amazon echo is a great product. The only thing is that it doesn't work properly when the tv volume is a little high!
1,"very happy with this item, protects well, looks good, and was easy to install"
0,I like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k
1,Got this so I could stream sling tv and get away from huge satellite bills. Works well and can stream everything I want. Just wish I had better internet provider.
0,Sold it on Craigslist the day I bought itWhat does that tell you.
1,"This nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutches of the evil and nefarious clutches of the dreaded cable empire. No longer will you be subjected to their random price raises of their already high prices. No more will you fret over paying exorbitant fees for channels that you don't even watch!! Yes this firestick can and will open up, quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you. Set up is simple and quick. There are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take complete control over what u want to watch and pay for. I'm not going to go into specifics about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interests. A simple google search will help guide you with those specifics. But just know that for financial freedom from contracts and corporate giants this is the way to go. One downside I will mention is the buffering. Ensure you have a good internet connection. This is a requirement for the device to work. Make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up its HD. Also ensure you have a router that is worth while. Personally I ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because I wanted the best connection possible and as we all know that requires hard wiring of your device. So if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box. For kids or something get them the stick."
1,I really was pleasantly surprised by how well Alexa is able to understand the commands
1,It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
1,"Great product at a great price from Best Buy. Have to press a button rather than just saying her name, but that's the price you pay for it being cordless."
1,I truly love how I can just talk to her and ask for what I want. I got friends and family members wanting one.
1,This is for my sister. She loved her older Kindle. I know she will love this one.
1,I love that there is a kids profile you can create on the tablet. Very user friendly.
1,A greatest Gift to me. Wow ! It is a masterr piece.
1,It is a great tablet believe it or not it is also great for kids use parental controls.
1,I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I must say it is fast and comes with Amazon underground apps which are all free. Great value!
1,"I appreciate the small size, clarity of text, and long battery life if the WiFi is turned off."
0,I tried to set it up for over an hour and it wouldn't connect to my wifi. The orange ring didn't last more than 30 sec to even give it a chance. It just sat their with the ring of death no matter how quick I was. Powered my router off and back on even. My other devices were connected just fine before and after. So frustrated and no matter how hard I tried it didn't work so I just took it back and got a refund. Totally disappointed!
1,I've used this for almost a month now. Excellent reading experience. It has adjustable brightness too. Doesn't strain the eyes even when reading in the dark.
1,I have owned several e-readers. This is the best one I have ever had! You won't regret when you get it.
1,"I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my 8 year old, that he could use for educational games and just for the usual game play and this tablet has been perfect. Battery life is good, speed is outstanding and you can't beat the price!"
1,Very versatile and can be great for kids & adults.
1,"A great device for readers that don't want clutter. Easy on the eyes with an adjustable back light and no glare whatsoever outside, even in direct sunlight."
1,Fun and interesting but will be better as the apps and software available for this item are more advanced/available.
1,We bought this as a gift. The gift receiver said it was easy to set up and works very well and as advertised. It is small enough to fit in any area of the home. It was a good gift choice.
1,Bought 2 Dots for myself and this one for my parents. They are in their 80s and they use Amazon to play music and I use it to drop in on them. They also use the Echo to call me in an emergency.
1,Nice for working out or spending time on the riverbank. Great product.
1,Used Kindle tablets before needed update. As sson as I started to use it liked it even more
0,Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
1,I love that is great for kids and the parents can monitor it. The kids love it too.
1,I didn't think it would be that much of an improvement over the paperwhite but taking all of the advances together it definitely beats it. The cost is high but having that crisp of a screen is worth it. Obviously when you can buy a Kindle fire HD for less you have to be dedicated to the look and functionality of an e-ink reader for this to be worth it. If you love e-ink books and want a much better lighting solution than the Kindle Paperwhite this is the best option.
1,"We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!"
1,"I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is ""Mom, you are the best"", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!"
1,"I wanted one for quite a while, caught it in Dale and I am very pleased with it. The battery lasts longer than my kindle touch from several years being able to adjust the back ground light makes reading enjoyable in low light. Glad I bought it"
1,First time user - had no problem getting started - must have internet connection and know name and password for wi-fi
1,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
1,I love it I am still trying to figure out all its skills but everyday is a surprise.
1,"I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it."
1,Purchased this orange Kindle as a gift for my niece after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.
1,This is a great device and it streams better than the usual fire stick.
1,"Bought this for my husband and he loves it, so easy for him to get information, he's not one for computers and this is a magnificent substitute for his needs."
1,"I can't say enough about this so I will just say I love it! Very loud! Louder than my Bose Soundlink Mini speaker and better sound quality. However, because it is so loud it doesn't catch what you're trying to say if the volume is too loud. Also, I'm Mexican so I have a hard time getting it to understand what music to play when it comes to music with Spanish titles. Other than those two things though, I have no complaints. It is very easy to use and was very easy to set up."
1,Awesome. I really enjoy using it. The portability is a plus!
1,"This is a great tablet, and the price was amazing!"
1,much faster and stable than the fire tv stick... definitely worth the upgrade
0,"This is a very wonderful streaming product. It is fast and has numerous app capabilities. There are some flaws though. The remote sometimes doesn't work then you'll have take out and put in the batteries, but you can use you're phone as a remote, it is faster and easier that way too. And it doesn't support VUDU or Crunchyroll. You can only real put this divice to its full potential if you're a Amazon prime member"
1,I love my kindle because it's so convenient when I want a new book. I can download it right away from the device and even check out books from the library. The battery lasts a long time. I've only charged it twice since I've had it and I read almost every night. I keep it on airplane mode to conserve extra battery.
1,Amazon fire is so awesome I bought two one for myself and one for my daughter who also has an ipad but now she always has her fire tablet with her
1,Much better then our old nook reader in every fashion
1,Got them on every TV in the house. Fast internet is all you need
1,Has media streaming capabilities but also Alexa smart home functions. Good value for the price. This version has 4K streaming capability.
1,Pluses and minuses when compared to the Roku. Plus - can use the Alexa feature Minus- can not use the USB port to play videos from a USB like on the Roku. Plus - some channels not found on the Roku ( i think ) Minus - harder to find Channels when compared to the Roku.All and all a nice streamer
1,"Love it makes reading a pleasure. Easy on eyes, able to take anywhere, simple to use."
1,This tablet was recommended to me by a friend. It's definitely a great buy!
1,"My wife and I both got these. We've both really liked them. We had galaxy tab 3s before this and they seemed to slow down a little bit after a year. We're getting close to a year of having the fires, and seem to be still working well. The 8gb model has had some issues with big games, but casual games have worked well. We both like being able to take advantage of Amazon underground for apps. We've liked them so much we bought some for our nieces and nephews too."
1,"Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!"
1,Easy to use. Great user interface and easy to set up
0,I like this tablet because it entertains my kid and he loves it
1,The tablet is easy to use and has nice features. It is small enough to carry around.
1,"Bought this for my 6 yr old, she does everything on it, tech savy son set up parental limits on tablet, love that, it does run kind of slow when trying to watch a movie."
1,Great phones for my sons that are 13 and my 8 year old lives his kindle
1,"Got this for my father in law who loves to play games and read books, news."
1,I love my new Amazon Fire tablet. Easy to use and great for all levels
1,Bought the Amazon - Echo - Black as a gift. It was easy to connect to our WY-FI. It knows answers to the questions you ask.
1,This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
1,Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use.
1,This thing is awesome . Couldn't be happier !!!! ?
1,It is a great tool to have I like playing my music on command or setting a timer for something cooking. Plus small enough to keep on your counter.
1,Works really well. easy to use and easy to download from amazon prime account and other apps
1,This is by far the best streaming device around. My Chromecast was just given to someone free of charge. That was a waste of money. There isn't much you cant do with this. Couple this with a Prime membership and by by cable.
1,I've reviewed several units and this is still the best! Easy to install and setup and if you are a prime member it makes it all the better!
1,"I was looking for ways to cut cost from a raising cable bill and a friend suggested I try the Amazon Fire. At first I didn���t know if this was something I could do. Once I was able to maneuver through the process, I love it."
1,"This is our fifth kindle in the family. I bought this one for my son to replace a similar one that stopped functioning after a few months. So far this one is working well. But just in case, I bought a one year warranty in case it fails."
0,"It's a nice looking cover, will keep the Fire clean, but not particularly safe in a fall. (I have the black one. It is very professional looking.) No padding whatsoever. It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject."
1,I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader.
1,I love that I can have the convenience of my laptop and my games in a small tablet.
1,"Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect."
1,Perfect for reading books better than iPad because of the front lit screen
1,Bought these for my sons and they love them. Lots of cool features.
1,Great price and the item worked perfectly. I searched the internet and Best buy had comparable pricinr.
1,I purchased this device for the text-to-speech function which is does well.
1,"Absolutely love this new Kindle! Light, sharp, glass touchscreen and adaptive front light. Very easy to use and read!"
1,Good value for the price. Little bit heavy to carry.
1,I'd been using a 15+ year old stereo that was taking up a 2 ft square space. Alexa uses about 4 inches. The sound is fabulous! Why didn't I do this sooner?
1,Piece of mind that the little one won't wonder the World Wide Web and be exposed to things no parent wants to have to explain!
0,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
1,"Best tablet I've ever owned. Super clear picture, amazing sound & the battery lasts forever. Brightness is adjustable so it's great for reading or games & playing around on the internet."
1,"Excellent cameraKids friendly, battery last longer,easy to carry"
0,"Amazon should include this charger with the Kindle. The fact that they're charging us extra for something that should be included is a sign of cheapness. Plus, you can use any micro-USB phone charger instead of this to charge your Kindle. Save your money."
1,I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed.
0,I liked my Kindle fire better. Kindle Fire was easier to hold and easier to use.
1,"I bought this product to make things a little simpilar in my life. Everything from shopping lists to music to quick information on the run (weather, traffic, news even sports scores). The only knock on this is that when an Amazon Echo commercial plays and the actors say Alexa, the unit powers on and answers. I just wish there was a way this could separate my voice from the TV."
1,I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
1,It is my favorite thing for relax me into my house-
1,"I purchased this because I wasn't sure how a tablet would work for me, and wanted to buy an inexpensive ""starter."" I was quickly sold on the convenience and ease of use. The ads are a minor issue - they go away with the swipe of a finger! I'm able to watch tv and movies, access the internet via Wi-Fi, play games, and send email with ease. (Be aware - this tablet does come with a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime, and if you don't cancel before the end of that trial, it automatically enrolls you.)"
1,"This is one of the best toys I have. Everyone enjoys how easy it is to get information, news, music and more. The sound is great even outside. The only reason I did not give a rating of 5 is that the Echo has to be plugged in to operate. I wrongly assumed it was portable. However, I was able to purchase a battery that hooks on to the bottom and now my Echo is portable!"
1,I have enjoyed my Amazon Fire. It tends to be slow to download but other than that I am very happy with it.
1,"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power."
1,Excellent tablet for the price. We bought it as a child's tablet to surf and play games. Has tons of free apps for kids.
0,"The unit itself is very simple to use, somewhat difficult to get connected at startup but once setup ran flawlessly. Memory a little small."
1,Mucch better than my previous tablet. Runs great and fast. Best decision ever
1,Great tablet for my kids or beginners.Highly recommend for all ages
1,This tablet is great for a toddler. Easy to use ! Easy to turn on & off.
1,This is a great travel companion. Long battery life and easy to use.
0,"My only comment, the pre installed apps cannot be removed. I purchased the 8GB model. Only about 2 GB of storage available."
1,This is a great device for reading books. I was using a Tablet for that but the screen on this is far easier on your eyes for long extended use.
1,So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
1,Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
1,"This is a must buy , it really is awesome !!! Really like its versatility in Mobile ness I wouldn't recommend this to anybody that was interested in a portable speaker and I love talking to it Alexa!!!"
1,This is a great product! Would definitely recommend this item!
0,This tablet was plugged in all night and did not charge.No powerWhite elephant
1,Able to read in all types of light- great reader for on the go and on the road
1,This is a good device. Everything works the way it should.
1,We are going to do our entire home with these types of products. Love the interaction it offers.
1,They were really excited about this Christmas gift!!!
1,"In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon."
1,Decent choices. Integrates Netflix and voice commands. Sometimes loses wifi connection and has to be reset.
1,"Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped."
1,Bought it for young granddaughter for Christmas. Husband liked it and bought himself one.
1,Good reader and great for streaming apps. Kid friendly too
1,Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
1,The speaker is very good. I've had no problems with it understanding my commands. I enjoy having Alexa around the house!
1,Good purchase
1,Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
1,"I had a kindle which I unfortunately threw away by mistake with some papers. I bought a paper white and I am back to being able to read all the books I want, It can be put in my purse and I can read where ever I go."
1,This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.
1,I'm amazed at how easy it is to use and how useful it is. I would recommend this product
1,"The new Kindle may not have all the bells and whistles of previous models, but it is a great value for the price. Durable and light, and with the addition of expandable memory, this new model works great and is very recommended."
1,"This is truly a great streamer! I know you have other video streamers which are great and I'm sure they are but I used this video streamer for Pandora, YouTube, Netflix, CNBC, and Slingbox and I have to say, it is absolutely great. I've had no issues since installing it."
0,"This thing is a disaster. Unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life, you are in for disappointment. They've blocked the Google store, so good luck downloading most of the games you like. Youtube? owned by Google, so again, can't download the app. You CAN get there with the web browser, but why should you have to? I tried to download 3 games-- NONE of which would even load. In short, I owned it less than 16 hours. Waste of my time. Save your money and buy a Samsung Galaxy Tablet."
1,"We love this device. I have the Echo, Echo Tap and the Echo Dot. As the updates arrive, each of the devices just get better and more useful. I love the AI easy access and versatility."
1,Great tablet for my 3 year old son. I am able to monitor his screen time and assure that he is only playing kid friendly and educational games.
1,Bought this for my 9 year. This is the 2nd one he has had because he literally wore the first out.
0,Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).
1,The things you can ask her are unlimited as long as you download the program you want into the echo app. But there are so many too go through not 100% sure what's good and what's not
1,Alexis is very useful for many different fun apps.
1,Bought this one for our white kitchen. Blends in well and is very handy both in the morning and at dinner time. New features added weekly.
1,Had a firestick previously this is far superior. Like this a lot more then the basic new firestick and bestbuy got it to me within 2 days when everyone else was sold out
1,What a great product for the $. It does exactly what it needs to and then some.
1,Differently recommend. Easy to install and ease of use.
1,"The Amazon Echo is my new BFF! I use it right now primarily for my shopping list. I say "" Alexa, put eggs on my shopping list."" And Alexa says back ""I've added eggs to your shopping list."" Then when I get to the grocery store, I open the app on my phone and there is my shopping list! No more forgetting what I needed to buy. I'm looking forward to learning more things that Alexa can do! I have played my Pandora music on the Echo, asked Alexa to tell me a joke, and checked the weather. She can do so much more."
1,"It is all but perfection. It's a library in the hand. Inside or out. It reads equally as beautiful in either environment. I only penalize it for its lack of allowing books, bought outside Amazon ecosystem, to be included in FreeTime. FreeTime is advertised as for kids but I like the idea of knowing how much time I've spent reading and the other offerings of FreeTime."
1,I find that this is the perfect size for reading. Great price point.
1,Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.
1,I purchased this tablet for my child for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He has also dropped it a few times and it hasn't cracked or anything.
1,Does the job. Kids are kinda of rough with its holding up well.
1,It can do a lot of things. We've been using it fro music and news for the short time we've had it.
1,"I can hold this next to my Kindle Paperwhite and see that is brighter, more evenly lit, sharper and faster. But $200 is pushing the price a little high. If a friend wasn't looking to buy my old one, not sure I would have paid that much."
1,Iam enjoying my fire tv with all the app and movies would recommend it .
1,"Love, love, love her. Looking forward to expanding on the abilities."
1,"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen"
1,This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
1,Love my red Otter Box! RTR! Protects my phone every time I drop it on the ground!
1,Voice commands with Alexa is excellent. Home automation with Philips Hue is great.
0,It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!
1,This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
1,Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read
1,"I can't say enough good about this product. It has LED's so the screen is backlit, and yet the battery still lasts for weeks! I've had mine for over a month and I still haven't had to charge it. The capacitive touch screen is perfectly responsive and fast too. It makes no sense at all to pay so much more for the voyage or oasis, when the paperwhite is such a fantastic buy."
0,Great for ppl that use Amazon and Amazon products. The price was great to.
1,It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...
1,"Good fun activity if you enable certain skills , kids enjoy it . Good sound quality"
1,I use this to have many TVs running at the same time without having to pay for cable.
1,The google note is a lot fun and it has a lot of built in knowledge.
1,I simply love my Fire TV. It is fast and has tons of free content with prime. The only complaint I have is that there is not one app that will link to my Ultraviolet library
1,The voice control is great. Took some time to get used to installing skills and specific phrases.
1,it works great and this is my second one since I lost the old one anyway
1,I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
1,It is a must have item if you have limited space at home and you would want a collection of your own. It is light weight compare to the old kindle. The backlight feature of the paperwhite is perfect to read in the dark and able to share books with family members with a library share feature.
1,Has a timer for how long your kids can be on the tablet
0,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
1,"I didn't have any expectations before buying the Fire tablet (which may have been a good thing). With the discount offered over Black Friday, I just couldn't resist. Well, I am totally amazed at how good it is, especially considering that it only cost me $33. I download ebooks from my library, surf the web, do my email so what is there not to like? Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of an iPad but, for me, it is the ideal portable internet device (even better than my mobile phone)."
0,"I purchased my Amazon Fire to check my E-mails and play games on it. SinceI have been using it, I check my bank accounts, use for reading and getting answers for problems on the internet. I am a Happy Camper."
1,This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
1,This was perfect for my 4 year old. She gets all the apps she wants and it works great. Even dropped it a couple times and it ls still in one piece!
1,I like the price and features of the tablet . Its great in this price
1,Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
1,Bought 2 for the kids and they seem happy with them.
1,We got this mainly so that my husband could listen to music while getting ready for sleep. Really works well.
1,Alexa is getting smarter and gaining a sense of humor as well similar to Siri. The speaker sounds great and Alexa curates the music of our chosen genre in the house all the time.
1,"Great gift for the people who have it all. I gave one to my 80 year old Dad and he loves the wealth of knowledge Alexa has to share. I love my Amazon Echo, especially for the music. Very easy to set up and use."
1,"Fire TV is a game changer, definitely worth it to spend the extra clams on this over the fire stick. Awesome product,"
1,I have more than one and am glad I ordered another. You can never have too many USB chargers.
1,The best part of the kindle is a lot of the games are free.
1,"It's not a high end tablet, but it is great for ebooks and light gaming. Great battery life too"
1,"Exactly what we wanted from it, something to use the streaming apps when the tv is being used, and want something larger then your phone. Battery lasts days and was great purchase."
1,"I bought the Echo for my wife. She absolutely loves it! She mostly has it play music, but even the grandkids like to ask it questions like jokes."
0,"Cheap functional tablet, slower than most if not all latest smartphones."
0,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
1,This was a great purchase met needs of 93 old mom in law who needed a large read space for bad eyes
1,Great product with a ton of features. Add the Echo Dot to get even more out of it
1,"I went shopping on Black Friday just with plans to buy a GPS, then there was a display of the Amazon Fire tablets, people were grabbing them quickly, I grabbed four myself, I saved one for my wife and myself, two for presents. I use the tablet more than my laptop, this tablet is filled with games, an excellent camera, watch T.V. & Sports, reading Books, it comes with 8gb but it can handle up to 128gb."
1,The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.
1,This is a great way to beat cable. Easy to set up!
1,"This is the third one in our house. It's great for book reading, surfing the web and checking emails"
1,"Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use"
1,Small and light weight. Even in a leather case. I was concerned about the small screen but was not a problem after using it for a while.
1,I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
1,"I bought this tablet for my step daughter, who asked for a tablet. She threw a fit because she wanted a more expensive tablet. I only returned it because I already have a tablet and didn't need another. I would not have a problem recommending the Amazon Fire Tablet to those looking for an economical tablet for a child"
1,I love how this one lets you download apps. The picture quality is also a 4. I do find myself having to unplug it every 3 days to make it start over or it has trouble downloading. Especially with live tv apps. As for its competitors I'd say this is still the one to get. I find myself having a lot more options with this one. So my cons are minor. But still prevented me from a 5 star rating. I believe their next generation will be a 5 tho. Like I said. It's still the one with the most options available. Especially if you have prime. The best thing about Fire tv is it let's me download the direct tv app so I ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app. It's the same tv and I pay over a $100 less a month now. It's worth it just for that.
1,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful."
1,"I have one in every room. It does everything from playing music, getting info and I use it for an alarm clock."
1,My kids love it their first tablet they pay on it all the time
1,"I originally bought this because of frustration in using my IPad for several websites. So I decided to try the Fire tablet. Well it did get me to the websites that IOS on my IPad didn't. But I started to investigate it more thoroughly. I checked the manual and started to have more fun. The camera works great , and the apps are great! This was to be a secondary purchase but I am using it more and more."
1,We love! This was a great buy she's so helpful with everyday stuff.
1,Great replacement for the disappointing tablet that my daughter last used before it died.
1,OMG - who needs a personal assistant when you have Alexa.Love it!
1,"Many features packed into a low price. Good as an ereader or light tablet uses to surf internet, email and games. Easy to use. Memory is expandable too."
1,"Great product and easy to use. Plays news, weather, music, games, and more"
1,Great for listening to music (Pandora especially) or as a novelty!
1,My grandson is really enjoying this product and it is standing up well to his use
1,Parental controls are amazing and easy to use on this kindle.
1,I bought one specifically to play music videos in my car with the Bluetooth sinced to my stereo. It's awesome.
1,"Amazing flexibility and range of available apps (over 2,000!) for this product. My daughter loves it!!"
1,So this is my second fire tv and just like my first one I love this one just as much. My advice is you are debating between the fire stick or the fire tv pay the extra money and get the fire tv.
1,My girls loved the tablets and the cases even though both of them have Iphones. I haven't seen them that excited about a Christmas gift since they were children awaiting Santa Claus! My oldest daughter found it perfect for her flight to France!!!
0,My kids like down games and play with. It is for young children if you don’t want spent a lot of money
1,my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
1,great product would definitely recommend fir other
1,My wife was the one who wanted this item. It unpacked easily and setup was a dream. All you need is an Amazon account to start. It responds quickly and has unlimited potential. My only gripe is that you have to look up the skills but I suppose someone will figure out how to overcome that. It is always listening and will turn up or down the volume by command. We are still having fun playing with it. PANDORA AND IHEART are the best!
1,Can't beat this tablet for the price. Great for reading and basic games. Perfect second tablet for taking places without worrying about all the things that can happen to your more expensive tablet.
1,This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
1,"Haven't had it long , at this time Iam pleased with it ."
1,"such a very good tablet, with great apps and very easy to use. bought for an 11 year old grandson who is very happy with it."
1,I bought this for my wife after she started having headaches from doing Facebook and email on her iPhone. The larger screen makes it easier for her to use for an extended period of time.
1,Bought this as a Christmas present. It was excellent.
0,"Great price for a tablet I got two of them one for each if my children ranging from 7 and 8 years old only down part I can think of is the charging port going bad, It's super ooose and hard to charge."
1,Got a great item for a great price. I'm totally in love with this item. Well worth the price.
1,"Bought this as a birthday gift for my 80 year old dad and he loves it. Even though he is tech savvy, no need to be to setup or use."
1,"Alexia is so convient, love music so she makes me so happy. I have not tried the other options of getting the light fixture attachments to turn on and off lights."
1,Amazon's Echo is quite amazing. Always responds accurately. Great sound from its speakers.
1,My 5 years old son has loads of fun with this tablet. I would buy again.
1,This is a great product . I bought it for my grandsons 12th birthday. It was super easy for him to monuva. He loves it
1,Love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. My last Fire HD was not as slow.
1,This is a very simple unit to unit reading if not strenuous at all on the eyes
1,My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.
1,I have enjoyed my Kindle. I am an avid reader and receive savings on my books. Love the ability to select font size too.
1,I use my Kindle Fire mostly for reading Kindle books and I am pleased with this inexpensive little tablet.
1,"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
1,Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.
1,This replaced a gift from the past year that didn't come with an expansion slot. He was very happy to get this.
1,"Fabulous little tablet for the money. Light and zippy. A few limitations on available apps and external hardware but if you just want something to access email, read a book or stream video this is the way to go.I needed this as an early December birthday present for an older lady whose old tablet had quit working. She loves it.Also Best Buy came through when Amazon was already out of their own product before it was even December."
1,"This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations."
1,"More positives than negatives on this one. Battery is great, readability is great. The backlight makes low light reading super. The only thing that would make this even better would be water resistance."
1,I purchased this tablet as a gift. It is a nice little tablet for the money!
1,I really like the easy setup and the parental cobtrols.. its easy to download games and my daughter loves it
1,I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and she loves it.
1,I have the happiest grandson ever. Which makes me the best grandma ever!!
1,I bought two of these for black friday and the kids love them
1,Love it! So much better than the model I had previously.
1,"Got it home, was able to set it up in a few minutes."
1,Great because I can play music from phone without battery go In down
1,"I bought this primarily for reading books and it is just the right size. Easy to figure out how to use once you figure out the various tabs at the top that scroll (Apps, books, etc)."
1,"Great size and the ability to make print type changes. Love to carry whiletraveling and my time, spare time,can be managed better to reading, which I love to do."
1,"The Kindle Voyage is always with my in my purse. It is light, compact and easy to hold. I still love hard cover books but now I don't have to carry around the books from my book club. Some of the books I would rather not have to keep up with anyway. And, I can jump back and forth between stories."
1,Bought this for my dad. He absolutely loves it. It's easy to set up and very user friendly.
1,i brought this for my kids and no regret. Make sure you buy a case protector along with it.
1,"Easy setup.Easily connected to our homes Harmony setup. Gave us a reason to get Phillip Hues lights and could not be happier. Alexa works great ""most"" of the time. Found location is key, especially when playing tv. (Alexa can sometimes not gear our voice due to location too close to speakers) moved and works better. Always getting better.... echo can now call (soon video with another device) any echo products... (only Amazon to Amazon, for now, no cell phones)"
1,"This has become like coffee, I use it every morning while I get ready for work. Easy to take outside for my yard work as well! Oh, and my 3yr old son loves talking to it!"
1,"This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter."
1,"I love my kindle fire. So much so when I misplaced my first kindle I went to Best Buy to get another. It was only $40 after all. I read books on it but it does so much more! I watch movies, play games, shop, browse the internet. Pretty much everything I can do on a much more expensive tablet."
1,"I am a teacher and bought a many of these during the Thanksgiving weekend sale. They have been a great asset in the classroom as an extra web browser. They are easy to use and set up. I don't personally read much on these devices, but would recommend them as an affordable and reliable tablet for every day use."
0,I've been spoiled by Apple. I bought the tablet for my son so he could have his own. He still uses his sister's iPod and iPad and they are years old.I would only recommend this to families that don't own apple products.
1,I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
1,"I used to read books off my iPad but I love the Kindle so much more. Easier on my eyes, easier to take with me when I travel, overall so much better for reading!"
1,"I've always used e-readers. The Kindle Paper White is extremely light weight, easy to use and wonderful for night reading when your partner is trying to sleep. I have a specific eye problem with one of my eyes and find I have to read large print books and they can be difficult to find. The Kindle allows me to read EVERYTHING! I love it. And it is great indoors or out."
1,Amazon Fire is easy to setup and easy to use. The user interface is friendly.
1,I have had other devices like this. This one by far is the best. No glitches or buffering.
1,Since I got a 4k television I purchased this. Its a great little device. I still have an original 1080p version and this one is slightly faster. Great product.
1,This is an excellent product. I bought mine when it was on sale for $84.99. It was a great investment.
0,Bought this for my son for Christmas has been the biggest problem I have ever seen I would never give this to anyone again it's better being a paper weight
1,We are super happy with the Amazon Fire. We are using it more than our DirectTv. Quality is good and user friendly.
1,"Purchased this TV as a birthday present, and it didn't disappoint! She absolutely loves it, raves about it all the time! Great sound, display and was easy to mount."
1,"We got this just before Christmas and have really enjoyed having it. My 7 year old loves playing 20 questions, asking random questions and checking the weather. We do have many of our lights throughout the house where Alexa will control them as well as the Nest thermostat. The music selection is pretty expansive with just what comes with Prime, but we may upgrade the music. Liked it so much we bought two dots for the bedrooms and have them hooked up to speakers. Alexa isn't perfect, but neither is Siri. Overall it's been a great purchase for our family."
1,this is my mothers first tablet ever so we're getting her use to Electronics. She does love it
1,Great just really great. It's like Trump is talking about my amazon fire box
1,"Decent product, great for kids, cheap enough that if it breaks it is not a huge deal"
1,It is a quality product and has clear crisp sound. Best part it can be carried in any satchel. Sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering.
1,"Fun product, does what we ask. Alexa is worth the investment"
1,"Needed speaker system for office music and the Echo is very easy to set up syncing with my iPhone by adding the Alexa App. Took maybe 5 minutes from opening box to playing Pandora on it. Have built in speakers in our house but they connect to CD player, radio or cable music channels but I wanted something that I could easily control the genre and this is it!"
1,"I opted for the Echo over the Dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker, and because I planned to add Dots to my environment later to create a system of assistants. The speaker sound is not great, but it's not the worst I've heard. I've also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit. The Echo was easy to set up, and is really easy to use. I especially like the ability to create a shopping list (although I wish I could create more than one list without adding apps), and to easily integrate my Google Calendar. I'm currently exploring other features and ""skills"" for the system, some of which are very entertaining and useful. One disappointment is the limitation of the near-field voice recognition range. Alexa may be always listening, but her ears don't seem to be very good. If I'm more than 15-20 feet or one room away (with not walls between us) she usually doesn't pick up my commands.That not withstanding, she recognizes commands very well, and is very pleasant to interact with.Another issue I discovered is that in order for the echo to access your Spotify music service at all, you have to subscribe to the premium version. I can understand that, given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them. However, with Amazon Music you can access the free version and their premium Amazon Prime version.In the area of smart home capability, I purchased a Philips Hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights, and was able to get them set up in the app very easily. Alexa does a great job of controlling them for us, but I am disappointed that the only place I can find additional bulbs seems to be online where I have to pay for shipping in addition to tax. Apparently the retailers (Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) haven't seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted. I'll be adding other devices as time progresses, and expect to be pleased with the results."
1,"This a easy and great item to begin building a Smarthome. The Echo alone adds many features, but it works great with other items as well."
1,This is my grandson first tablet. He is thoroughly enjoying it.
1,"After using the Fire Stick for a few months and loving it I decided to give it to my sister and upgrade to the Fire TV for myself. Worth every penny! The Fire TV offers everything the Fire Stick offers but it's so much faster and has more than enough storage anyone would need. The microphone works great. The menu layout is improved and far better than the menu layout on the stick. I have the 4th generation Apple TV and I barely use it Bc the new remote is terrible. The sensitivity pad on the remote is all over the place. The home menu is boring. The only advantage the Apple TV has over the Fire TV is the seamless integration with other Apple devices such as iPhone and my MacBook. Other than that, the Fire TV is far better and I would recommend it over the Apple TV any day."
1,I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
1,very nice tablet. very fast for the price. camera takes good quality pictures.
1,It is nice not to have to pay for tv and have so many more choices.
1,Great Electronic! Great size! Great Quality! My son is in love with this tablet
1,Got it for my grandmother and she loves to play games on it
1,Very easy to hold and read in the evening without hurting your eyes. Love it.
1,I wish I didn't wait to get this. It is so much faster than using a DVD player for apps like Hulu and Netfliz. Plus the voice serach is handy.
1,I'm in love with Alexa! This is the most amazing piece of technology I've ever owned!
1,"If you need to read a review about this product, you've been living in a cave."
1,Bought this for a friend who loves it. Simple and easy to use.
0,I love using it to read and surf the internet. It is also very handy.
1,I bought this tablet for my 1.5 years old little sister. I downloaded youtube apps and kids apps on this tablet. She really likes it. Overall very good tablet for beginners in reasonable price.
1,"Great value for the price, used as a backup to keep at work"
1,I have a three year old one and this makes it work like a dinosaur. So many improvements.
1,"It fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight, especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that's a minor thing."
1,This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
1,Pretty good Will recommend it to friends and family
1,Have a Smarthings hub which with Amazon Echo has become the best of two worlds.
1,"I got this so that I could read books on it that I didn't have an actual book version of. I like it because I am able to take it with me on trips and occupy myself that way. Also, I am able to have my daughter read books on it too. The battery life is great and I have just purchased another one for my fianc."
1,Great tablet for all your day to day needs at a fraction of the cost of other brands
1,"Kindle is still the top ereader. My first one finally ""wore"" out from years of daily use. It was so light to hold and to travel with. Battery life was great and it was so easy to read in daylight. This updated model is so much better. The backlight is a great improvement and is such a delight to use at night while reading in bed. This basic model is really all you need for reading books"
1,Help my 2 year learn he loves to play it and watch movies on it
0,It's an OK product. Nothing special. Not on the cutting edge of technology
1,"Yes, no problem it works great"
1,My Grandson love this tablet it's great for a 6 year old
1,Awesome product for reason on the go! And great quality doesn't hurt my eyes and I can see it clearly day or night!
1,This does everything I would expect out of s tablet. Like it better than the Kindle.
1,I really only bought this to read book and to have the kids play or watch whatever the want. It's an amazing tablet for the price!
1,THIS A GREAT PRICE FOR THIS SIZE TV IT HAS EVERYTHING WE WANTED SMART 4K
0,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
1,"Amazon tablet great gift, love the 6 pack gift idea"
1,"This is a good tool to use... I however, would suggest that you upgrade to the better version.. I did, and I like it much better."
1,"We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need."
1,"Bought this as part of the Black Friday sale. For $40, it serves well as a light use tablet (Skype, e-mail, video, etc.). The ads and heavy Amazon product front load push are annoying. Can't change or hide any preloaded features. Can't complain much for the price and the fact that I won't break a sweat if it falls out my car or gets misplaced."
1,Purchased the Echo as a bridal shower gift. My niece and her fiancé are still learning about all it can do but already reported back to me that they love it. I was told it is the most favorite gift they received.
1,"Bought this for my mother in law as her first tablet, she loves it! Great value."
0,I would like this product a lot more if it came with a remote control that is not as small as the original
1,I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
1,I prefer this than anything else out there. It might be because I am partial to Amazon and its service.
1,Don't know whether I will ever get used to talking to my electronic devices but when paired with a compatible remote control this thing can just about contril everything in your house.
1,My niece love her tablet can beat the price only 39.99
1,easy set up there so much to do with the echo only draw back you need amazon prime to use all its features
1,"Great for a older kid,great price and descent quality"
1,I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
1,Bought this for my 10 year old daughter to use with our homeschool. It's just the right size for her to carry around. Big enough to see videos well but not so big that it's difficult to deal with. We love it.
0,You get what you pay for. It's $50 and that's about the quality you get. Overall works great but slow and crashes occasionally. Not the best battery.
1,Bought this for my son and he is enjoying it everyday. user friendly
1,We love the Amazon Echo. I look forward to using it for shopping list.
1,Bought as a gift and person that received the Kindle has really enjoyed it.
1,Best pad for reading EVER! I would highly recommend anyone to get this product.
1,Who needs a wife when Alexa does it all? She is a great listener.
1,"So long cable, well worth it. All you need plus more."
1,"I use this item everyday. It can be for the time, play music on Spotify, weather, anything. I have the Echo and the Echo dot."
1,Its awsome works beautifully it's awesome perfect video quality does what it says I'm packaging Best Buy service was nice
1,"Able to watch so many movies, Netflix and get access to more than just the normal cable offsprings."
1,"Compact, great look without that super bright look of tablets that seems to strain my eyes when reading for a while. Not much as far as tablet features, but as just an e-reader this is the best out there for now"
1,I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend to use for Netflix and email responses (without breaking out his huge laptop). He loves the portability of the device. Just wish the apps were a bit more sophisticated in what you can get.
0,"After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created. I think this will be great in the future but as far as offices go, it seems an unnecessary false luxury. At home with smart appliances may be its only use. (Recommended for home entertainment use only)."
1,I just loved it .. it was really nice .. I would definitely recommend to buy the product
1,"I love this Kindle--easy to use, great on the eyes."
1,Great for playing out music in the house. Not used for much else
1,This is a very good item and I would recommend highly.
1,The fire tv serves my needs far better than an Apple TV. The ability to side load additional apps is exactly what I needed. The Amazon prime media viewing is a great bonus. For the price the power and memory of this devise far surpasses what I was previously using. I think is the 6th device I have purchased. One for every room and some for friends and family
1,"Wow says a lot. We are already prime members and love the normal benefits, but this box added to the list offering a huge selection of things to watch."
1,"Kindle Oasis is very light, with 4 gb of memory no need for WIFI to read!"
0,the app for that does not work well i haven't used it that much just for news
1,Purchased for my son as a Christmas gift and he loves it. Easy to use for a 5 year old
1,I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps
1,It is a good buy for the price and the performance is also awesome
1,"For reading only purposes, this Kindle Paperwhite fits the bill and is easy to carry everywhere and catch up on some reading. I'm glad I made this purchase would highly recommend."
0,"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
1,Great tablet for an older person. I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my aunt. She loves the simplicity it offers.
1,Very happy with this purchase. For the price you can not go wrong. I mainly use for reading so I am sure for a techy geek this would not work.
1,"Great basic features - e-mail, web access, etc. Highly portable"
1,Not a bad deal on a small but good tabletEasy to use
1,My wife has an older paperwhite that still functions very well. We decided to get this one for my daughter because she's a book worm. It's worked great and she loves it.
1,Bought this as present for the sister. She loves it. For browsing the internet and the occasional games its perfect. Would definitely recommend.
1,like that fact I can read my books and play some apps
1,"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
1,I was very pleased with the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet. The product is priced right making it a great buy and value.
1,"The tablet is a lot smaller than my old one, but it provides me with a lot more features, memory capacity, and lets me do things I wasn't able to do with my old kindle."
1,This is the best kindle available. I recommend to al my friends.
1,Good product. Get rid of one of my extra Comcast boxes so I'm down to one. You can use your Comcast subscription to get live streaming of certain channels. Eventually I will ditch cable completely but this is a good start
1,Amazon makes such a good eReader that no other company even tries to make one. There are very few products in the world where that is true. The Paperwhite is worth the extra money for the lighting.
1,The Amazon Fire is the best bargain without giving up anything... So far it has done everything I could have ever dreamed
1,I bought 1 a year ago for our oldest kid. Came back this year and bought two more. Built really well. This is the best choice for a kids tablet.
1,Love listening the music. Great to be able to get my weather forecast for the day!
1,Researched alot and found this to be the best for the money. Great for traveling and overall reading. I love real books but going to library was getting harder with my work schedule. Plus I can loan out my books and keep them to reread later!
1,If You Want a Regular Tablet With a Low Price Get This Especially if you have a Amazon Account Camera not that Great and Screen kind of low But For $49 Good Price i Like It
0,apps constantly fail to open. no flash for camera. hard to download anything not amazon ie: google apps. will be returning....
1,4K ready looks great very fast... Don't waste your money on the stick get this one
1,"I love this fire tablet. I can do anything on it, and my 5 year old loves playing games on it too."
1,I have purchased several tablets under 100 dollars and this is by far the best quality. The picture is much better then the other tablets. I gave it a 4 only because I still like my samsung tablet better.
0,I bought this for the offline movie download capability. When I travel it is amazing
1,good for reading on the fly and great battery life
0,"It's a great starter tablet for children,very inexpensive and durable."
1,"I bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so I decided to get one myself. This was my first personal foray into an Android based device being a tried and true iOS devotee, with a Mac and iPad. I will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the Fire tablet is great. The OS and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. I particularly like the easy to use and transport size. I still prefer to read on my kindle but I do read on here as well. If you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies, music, reading and other media driven activities (ideal for Amazon Prime members), this is perfect."
0,"Price was too high( so we found out). Customer service at Best Buy in North Myrtle Beach had very little patience with our questions, not enough questions answered. We later found out that this too is Best Buy policy."
1,"Works great, camera is not the best indoors, works well outdoors"
1,"I like this tablet very much. Good for kids to use and cost is low. Quality of touch screen is excellent. My kid can watch youtube cartoons, play games perfectly."
1,Bought this for my mom. Easy to use for her. I was impressed by the responsiveness of this tablet. Couldn't ask for more at the price I paid for it. Great purchase.
1,Great for music in the house and helps with the grocery list.
1,Saw advertisements for it so I thought I buy. Super easy to use.
1,"I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor"
1,"This is a nice ereader. It is hard to activate without WiFi access, but ebooks can be loaded through USB connection."
1,I got the kindle so that I could read books outdoors. Tablet has a glare and can't see screen. This is perfect. Easy set up easy to sync.
1,love it nice and clean powerful tv box fast shipping from best buy all the time
1,"I love my Kindle ,I use it every day and the size is perfect.."
1,Great learning tool. Kids love it and so do I. So fun to share time with the kids laughing while learning.
1,I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me.
1,Works way better than the fire tv stick. And works well with 4k t.v..
1,"It is easy to set up and use. It was surprising how well it could answer some random questions. I did make the mistake of telling my grandchildren, ages 3-8, how to use it. When they visit we hear Alexa answer ""how much does the earth weight"" dozens of times and have to listen to ""Kidsbop"" music. (That's right, we have no control over them.)"
1,"Got rid of my Apple TV because it didn't have Amazon Prime. Love the fact that you can get Netflix, Pandora, and Amazon Prime on one device."
1,Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
1,Set up was easy and I'm not really technological. The sound is fantastic and really fills the entire downstairs of my house. I love listening to music on it I love having random questions answered andI can't imagine not having my new roommate Alexa.
1,The Kindle Fire is a great tablet. It has lots of games and apps. My daughter loves it.
1,"I love this tablet,great for reading and keeping up with my emails."
1,"I got this for my teenage ""son"" who has really gotten into reading. The device is durable and easy to use. He is really happy to take a pile of books with him wherever he goes."
1,Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
1,"Super fun to connect with smart light bulbs and smart plugs - makes you feel like you have a Jetson house. The customized flash briefings are a good way to start the day, too."
0,I've had 5 in my household over the years. It's good and does a lot more than be a reader. It's like a tablet...
1,It is easy to set up and easy to use. You can use it to watch videos from the Amazon Prime video or listen to music with the Amazon Prime music or read on the Kindle. Great value for everything you get.
1,"This item is fair in price, and a great quality for my children! Keeps them busy while I take care of our home business."
1,Unleash all the tv shows and experiences you wanted to with this Amazon Fire TV box. Even better if you have a Prime account. I could watch all my entertainment right. No more high cable bills.
1,It was really easy to set up and start using quickly. Screen quality is great and the official Amazon Paperwhite case is a great addition. You can buy books either through your PC or directly on the Paperwhite itself. The screen is as good as on the pricier Kindle Voyage. :)
1,I am so glad I got my son (5 1/2 years old) the Fire Kids Edition Tablet! It is extremely durable & provides hours of educational entertaining fun!!!
1,We just love this item - had a problem with getting the correct temperature. Had to get technical support to help us. It has since been resolved
1,"I like this reader.. It is easy to read in daylight with no glare. It has an auto backlight that works well in all lighting situations. I like the links to the dictionary, encyclopedia and internet links in the indigenous. This reader utilizes them all."
0,"I bought this tablet to read Free Epub books that I have, but it didn't allow me to even look for the books, so I have it returned and exchanged for a cheaper one that still does a better job for those who wants to read free Epub books"
1,"We are having so much fun with the Echo. Alexa plays our favorite music we've saved in our libraryfinds new songs, gives us news updates and weather reports. I know she does much more but we have not had the time to experiment..The sound quality is great. After we bought ours, I bought a second one for a Christmas Gift."
1,This device streams available content smoothly. Plan to buy another one for children.
1,Love all the things Alexa can help with. Playing music and grocery list are my favs.
1,"My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good"
1,This tablet is a great economy tablet for personal use (reading or watching movies). It's great gift idea as well.
1,jUST FINE.
1,Loved the storage space and how fast it stream when watching movies. I haven't had a problem with and of the one I brought. good quality.
1,The Amazon Echo is worth purchasing. I wish it could access a wider variety of music and information.
1,Apple TV is going to do better than it currently is to keep up with Amazon Fire. So much more freedom with this little black box.
1,Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.
1,"love the light, this tablet is great, if u just want to read"
1,"Hands free operation at it's best. I have my Philips Hue hooked up to it (operating my kitchen and family room lights) as well as Pandora, iHeartRadio and my Nest. I have been using it for the past two weeks and I love it. The only issue I have experienced so far has been when I asked Alexa to turn on my family room lights, only one of the two bulbs turned on. This however, might be an issue with the Philips Hue hub. Other than that this has worked out great."
1,"Echo is a great device to have if you need an answer to a question or need the weather report, etc. One of the best uses I have found so far is the creation of a shopping list. As you think of items for a shopping list, just tell Alexa and she will add it to your list which you can recall later just before going to store. It is fun to ask Alexa trivia questions or use her for other fun tidbits of information."
1,"This is our second Echo, and a 4th Dot. Really love Echo and now have a Dot at the office. Easy to set up. I use it for news briefings, calendar, and music. Will be trying some new features...like messaging and Fitbit."
1,"Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it."
1,"I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas."
1,Was skeptical about this until it went on sale and we finally bought it. Gretat for home automation and music. Only disappointment is that we couldn't pair with another speaker.
1,Perfect for my kiddos. Great value and easy to use and set parental controls on
1,This helps me stream a lot of channels but not have to get expensive cable
1,"""Ok, I will rate your Echo. Your Echo has great sound to play all your favorite Spofity songs. It can give the hours to local restaurants, provide the weather and corny jokes. You can call or text your contacts on their mobile devices and call in from mobile devices as well. The voice-activated Echo does these things and so much more. Your Echo deserves a solid 5 stars."""
1,"You really can't go too wrong with this purchase because of the price. Works very well, but don't expect iPad quality. Does everything I've asked of it, but some web pages are harder to read partially because of it's small size (which can be handy) and it's lower resolution. It's a good second tablet and is better watching a movie on, then a smaller phone. Can throw it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it as you might be with a more expensive tablet."
1,The pictures are clear and it's it doesn't weight that much.
1,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
1,Love this bought it in addition to Apple TV it's an overall great product
1,It's a good little tablet. Not the fastest thing but good enough for 40 bucks can't complain.
1,"While definitely not a necessity, it is nice to have if you don't like going to the redbox all the time."
1,my daughter loves it its very easy to use i got the child proof case also
1,Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights.
1,i love it it works perfect for my kids. i am getting another for myself
1,Excellent screen to view movies and browse the net.
1,"Way easier than carrying a ton of books, easy to read from and convenient to use"
1,His is a very economical entry level tablet. Great for kids or for first time users.
1,"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge..."
1,"Great media player for watching movies and shows from netflix,hulu, etc. easy to navigate, quick quad core cpu keeps things from lagging, and voice commands via the voice remote make this a winner."
1,I love my amazon TV. It works great for my needs and I can also enjoy playing games on it.
1,"Battery life great, cameras + touring aps + music aps + radio AP make this a great addition to my Honda Valkyrie for road trips."
1,This is on of the best media players on the market.I have cromecast and roku and this is the tops .
1,I got these for my kids Christmas present and there perfect for them. They download their games on to them and play during road trips and also download learning apps from school so they can stay ahead.
1,This tables is fast and easy to use. I love the reading books in it and watch movies.
1,"This is a good product for books only. The apps and other things are not like an iPad. Very clunky, slow......However, the kindle is better than an iPad for book reading. It is lighter, the interface with Amazon is seamless and you can say download a sample of 40 pages for free before deciding to buy it, which is a huge plus !!"
1,"Easy to set up and use. It's a wonderful electronic device! With Amazon Prime and/or Pandera, it gives you voice control over a huge music library. In addition to music offerings, Alexa is very entertaining!"
1,FireTV is intuitive and fast. We had both a FireTV and a Fire Stick. We returned the Fire Stick because it seemed to lag a lot. Both FireTV units work well. It allows us to use PlayStation Vue as our primary live TV. A combination of PS Vue and free over the air TV (OTA with indoor antenna) allowed us to cut the cable. We did upgrade our internet as Centurylink offered a free upgrade to 40 mbps. This eliminated buffering on programs when multiple units were in use. We are very happy with the quality of picture and the channels. We will save a lot of money over time and the TV experience is great. We also like the free On Demand programming. Very pleased with this product.
1,"So far, the Amazon echo has been fun to interact with. It does all sorts of things and I need to spend some time learning about all it's functions."
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is an awesome alternative to a paperback book. Great reading and lighting in all angles and lighting conditions. Price is great compared to similar devices. Great at what its designed for - I highly recommend if you want a dedicated reading tablet.
1,"I love it!! It can do it all!! Beautiful color graphics and in no time at all, I can watch a movie or play games or read my favorite novel. I love it!!"
1,"Purchased as a gift gor fathers day and our while family enoys Alexa. New skills are always veing added. The sound is great and I really like that you can feedback on what she ""hears."""
1,Excellent tab ; originally struggled to get it into the web but discovered that we have to connect to Hot Spot from mobile phone ( not open wifi in public place)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
1,Smooth operating system. It's no IPAD but good enough for the money. Purchased for the kids to eliminate abuse to our higher priced items. Would have no problems buying the item again at this point.
0,I would recommend this for anyone. Real happy with it.
0,Never knows answers to question or has the song I want. And always says not getting connection. It sucks
0,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
1,"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption."
1,I'm setting up a smart home and the Amazon Echo is the starting point and it's so easy to use
1,This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to.
1,"I had used Roku, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV and Smart TV's digital feed. This device does the heavy lifting effortlessly, at $100.00 price point and allows the versitility of android tv customization.The Apple and Android Smart Phone Remote app trumps all the others.Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner."
1,I wasn't sure I should buy it because I thought it would be a cheaply made tablet for $50 but I was wrong. I LOVE IT. It's worth it
1,Bought ut for my 7 year old and it works great. It is a great price and a good way to help your child learn about the technology.
1,My kids love this tablet. I loved the price. With my ipad I cringe when they want to use it. They drop it and I loose $500.00. This little tablet is under $50.
1,I am really enjoying having books right at my fingertips. I am spending much more of my time reading than I did before. Love having a large library in such s small space
1,The Fire TV 4K shows great tv in 4K. I also own firesticks and they are great also. I purchased the Fire TV basically for the 4K and I'm not disappointed.
1,"Excellent for travel, games, email, small enough to carry"
1,"Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty."
1,Very happy with tablet. Easy to use. Hooks up to WiFi immediately
1,We purchased these for our younger kids (ages 5 & 7) so they could play games and read. Perfect size and they love them! The only negative is that the charging port is very fragile.
1,"It has a lot of free games plus all of the books I read. It's awesome, I don't even use my phone as much h because I have my tablet. For the price it can't be beat."
1,I have been very pleased with the ease of use of my Echo. Easy set up. Great to listen to Spotify on.
1,Easy to use. Easy to download books. Easy access to the web.
1,"great device to listen to music,best blue tooth on the market today,I highly recommend it"
1,"It is good device to have for reading, watching movie and surfing internet"
1,Echo is awesome. I now have two echos and one dot. Works great with my home automation. Actually has pretty good sound.
1,Very happy with this purchase which replaced a 3rd generation unit. Much easier on the eyes and very responsive to the touch. Takes a little to get used of the page foward/backward on this device but no big deal. The Reviews on Best Buy site were very instrumental in making this purchase.
1,Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.
1,"Serves my daily needs for email, local newspaper, and favorite apps -- like Pinterest, Instructibles, eBay, YouTube, Facebook, etc.Easy to use, convenient size & weight, great quality screen resolution and sound."
1,I use this to voice control different products around the house. It can integrate with light switches and my nest for example!
0,"I was exited about it but got disappointed. Same old GUI , 4K is limited. Search option is only for Amazon ..."
1,easy for my kids - 8 and 11 to use the kindle for night time reading
1,"The Amazon Echo is super easy to set up. Once set up, it's actually fun to see what Alexa would say to any and all of your questions. What's great is that even if there is background noise or other people talking at the same time, Alexa can still hear you and will respond accordingly."
1,My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!
1,Nice size easy to use for little people. Long lasting battery
1,"This is my first eReader, and it does not disappoint. It's comfortable to hold and it's easy on the eyes for extended reading. The adjustable controls for lighting work great. The only negative for me is that the eBooks my library system uses are not compatible with it. If this is an issue check first."
1,Bought this for my husband we both get a kick out of it. Very easy to use and I would definitely recommend this to all my family and friends.
1,Processing is fast and such a wonderful picture... All my apps right there I love it!
1,B ought this for my wife and she loves it. I love it too because it is the beginning of my home automation. Great product.
1,Bought this for my 78 year old mother who had recently broken her wrist. She absolutely loves it! She is reading all the time. Light enough she can hold it with one hand.
1,Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
1,"At an awesome price and great tablet! Works like a phone, so easy for smaller kids"
1,This product is a great entry level tablet. It is limited in both memory and function.
1,This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.
0,SPECIAL OFFERS means there are popup ads when you turn on the Kindle for games and books. I called amazon and they want me to pay $15.99 to turn this off! I am returning this and buying another brand of tablet. I am DONE with amazon they will never get a dime from me!
1,"Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended."
1,You needs to have the fire tv to maximize your prime membership
1,This is very easy to install and use. It has a lot more capabilities than we were aware of. New features are added each day in the market
1,Bought this Kindle for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it! She is able to read outside in the sunshine and at night in the dark. Very easy to navigate.
1,It worked fine however I returned everything as the Kindle was too small.
1,Great product does what it is supposed to with no problems!
1,"Well, its a little weak but its cheap. Good for the Amazon Ecosystem if you don't want or need googleplay and all that. Can still side load apps, but some might not work correctly if you need a play account (like clash of clans will install but not let you log in) Some other things were a pleasant surprise that they actually worked, even though they were not officially sanctioned by Amazon. Battery life leaves a little to be desired and the tablet can get warm. Cameras are not good at all, but I guess would suffice for video chat. But for a name brand and only $50, there isn't really much room to complain. The ads don't get in the way much, but you would have to pay $15 to remove them. I would leave them and save the money. Bottom line, you can't really go wrong with the price."
1,"I enjoy my new Kindle as a back up device. It does everything a desk top computer could do for me including, email, social media, and a search engine.It also easily travels with me everywhere."
1,Works awesome!! I would recommend getting one fast!!
1,I bought this since it has a special discount for elite plus members

1,I bought this one my niece and she loves it. She also take it on long road trips.
1,I love it. It is so easy to use and great apps to.
1,It's been very helpful around the house and I now plan on buying dots to place in certain sections of my house.
1,We bought it last year Black Friday for us and now we bought it as a gift because it's good for kids
1,"The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process."
1,Great product that is constantly improving with new skills
1,"I love it so much, high recommend !Alexa will be your friends."
1,WE RE ENJOYING ALEXA AND HER ESOTERIC RESPONSES VERY MUCH.
1,Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
1,Does everything you want a pad to do the price was the purchase point for me.. Easy set up
1,My daughter loves to read so we thought that a Fire would be a great option for her. She loves it. They are getting smaller as time goes on for sure but still just as durable. Great gift!
1,It allows me to read without using space in my phone.
1,"It is highly recommended for someone who loves reading. Easy set up, lots of books to download.I have iPad, but this beats reading experience hands down.One downside is that the new Kindle Paperwhite has lower battery life compared to it's previous generation. Hence only 4 star."
1,I love this tablet! Its easy to use and provides hours of e entertainment.
1,Nice and entertaining device. Does answer lot of things. Music is awesome. Totally satisfied!!
1,I was not happy when my original Kindle paperwhite failed after the warrantee period expired but I loved the battery life and readability in almost all environments.
1,Wonderful to be able to do so much with voice command. I need to get another one for my kids.
1,This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
0,Not bad for an entry-level tablet. Pretty much what I expected for the price I paid for it. My four-year-old loves it
1,The fire tv has exceeded my expectations. I use it all the time. The increased specs make it hands down worth the extra investment over the fire stick.
1,The Fire TV with quad-core processor is significantly faster than the older dual-core. Makes using streaming a breeze!
1,"We have 3 Kindles, all paper white models. They are lighter than the original model with the light on a spring. Both my grandson and I have iPads which we use for internet etc. The Kindles are the best for reading which helps encourage young readers."
1,I purchased two of these for my grandchildren 8 years and 2 years. The 8 yr. old wanted an IPod touch replacement to watch videos and play a few games and Skype with me for $35 vs. $300 I am very pleased. The 2 yr old watches Little Einsteins and this works great for her
1,It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
1,Bought it for my parents. They love it...buying another for my college daughter
1,Bought it for my son for Christmas and he uses it all the time. Great product for the price.
1,Has great features and is a very reliabe product by Amazon.
1,"This is my 3rd kindle purchase. I do also have an iPad and a Samsung tablet, but for reading that does not strain your eyes, long battery life, and soft backlight that can be adjusted from bright daylight to low-light dark room setting, that does not bother a sleeping husband, this is definitely the best. If you are an avid reader, then I especially recommend as the storage is also ample enough for hundreds of books and you still have all your kindle books purchased from Amazon in the cloud to free up space (if needed)."
1,got this and i can possibly say i definitely needed this
1,Brought amazon fire tablet for granddaughter she love it hours of fun
0,I thought I was getting a fast charger for the price I paid for this! It was 20 for this slow charger...the same price amazon charges for the fast charger. This charger should have been included with my Paperwhite...buyer beware this is way overpriced and should be free with the purchase od a kindle!!!
1,This was really easy to set up and it works perfectly the speaker sounds great for its size I wish it had some bass
0,very overpriced!
1,This is a small and compact device that is easy to use
1,"I'm a big outdoor reader, so the paperwhite is perfect for me."
1,"Alexa is great, the Amazing Echo is amazing! Great purchase."
1,I bought this for my parents and they love it. They are not tech people by any means and yet they are able to use it just fine.
1,My mom is an avid tablet user and I glad she got what she wanted
1,"At $50 it's worth getting if you have Prime or just use Amazon a lot. At $40 (on sale right now) it's a bargain. There's only one thing about it that's somewhat of a drawback: not very good battery life. But keep it in an area with a strong wi-fi signal and use Airplane Mode when you don't need wi-fi, and you'll only have to charge it every night. Seriously--every night."
1,Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
1,Good gift for my kid. Screen is a little small. Wish they have a bigger size
1,Great device! Has all apps avaliable in one box! Would recommend this for anyone!
1,"I love Alexa, I use it mostly to play music, and listen to the weather. I have a slight lisp in my voice and she understands me perfectly, where siri does not. The sound quality is remarkable, and the volume 10 (the highest) is incredibly loud. We use it daily and would replace it if ever didn't work."
0,"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates. I'd recommend a Samsung tablet or an iPad before I would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money."
1,It's worth the $50. The amazon App Store has a lot of potential. The UI is kinda like android but not as refined. I'm satisfied with the tablet.
1,Using it for my 5 years daughter. She is handling very easily without much supervision
1,"I love the fire tv for so many reasons! It is easy to take along anywhere and you can easily add apps, no need for cable!"
1,Best purchase . Use it daily. Loads fast great buy...
1,We bought this product to compliment our other amazon product for its portability.
1,Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.
1,"We have two Amazon Echo's and both work flawlessly! Easy to set up, great for all around use, constantly add new features."
1,Love this. Capabilities never end. The whole family enjoys this.
1,"Its a great set up for kids, my daughter loves it and plays it all the time."
1,"I bought this for my grand daughter, she previously had a Nabi. I like the fact that she can use the hot spot on our phones and she can log on to view her favorite shows.My grand daughter is seven, but she also looks at movies and programs that her one year old brother can enjoy. The tablet is light enough to take along any where. It also has a protective shell which is a plus when you have an active seven year old."
1,"An amazing electronic tool, so portable, great storage, books, great convenience."
1,Built in wifi support is much better than the fire stick.. Less buffering
1,Love that I don't have to clutter my living room with DVDs
1,Enjoying my Amazon Tap portable Bluetooth and Wi-F Speaker. It's everything I thought it would be an MORE!
1,"The Echo has simplified so many things- turning on the lights, checking the weather, playing music. I'd hate to think about what life was like before!"
1,Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet.
1,A friend had purchased this Kindle and I was really impressed with the ease of use and how easy it was to borrow books from the library and read it on this Kindle. It was easy on the eyes and quite handy to hold and transport.
1,"We love our Alexa! Mainly used to set timers, alarms, and listening to music. We've had four months and no major complaints. Amazon updating new commands often! Only reason 4 stars is the ability to pick up voices. We have to be rather close for Alexa to respond to us. My 5 year old son literally has to be right next to her for Alexa to pick up in his commands. Other than that works great and fun!"
1,I bought 2 as gifts. One for my husbands birthday. He reads a lot of books and is enjoying not holding the heavy books. The other for our granddaughters Christmas. Both seem very pleased. My husband said he should get me one for my birthday.
1,Can't beat the Fire tb at $50. Was able to root it in about 5min to get google apps installed and use it like an android tab. I mainly bought for reading to use the blue shade feature which is great. Only complaint is the processor is little lacking compared to phones with the same specs
1,I love my new Amazon Fire tablet. Its so easy to use and stays charged for a nice amount of time.
1,Does everything you need and for $50! It includes banner adds but they are not at annoying frequency.
1,I started with the original kindle and it worked great but required good lighting. The paperwhite is so much nicer as you can use anywhere and in any type of light. Perfect!
0,Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
1,"This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
1,I love this device for reading. The backlight comes in super handy when in dark spaces. Battery life is great. I like it!
1,works great the only thing they need to add is the ability to customize actions and commands
1,"Very happy with the tablet. Nice, portable size with good display."
1,"I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it."
1,GREAT TABLET FOR MY DAUGHTER And she loves it so very much...Thanx again Best Buy...
1,We got a great holiday deal on this tablet. The set up was easy and it made a great gift.
1,Now I am able to integrate my smart home devices. Works like a charm. Alexa is still developing her skills but she's keeping me entertained. Job well done Amazon.
1,"I bought one and then another one . I have been trying a lot of cheap tablets just to see how they compete with high end tablets . This one so far it's the best of the best . Quality and price wise. I mean 50 dollar ? Really ? I feel like I'm getting paid to take it home . Amazing product you won't be disappointed . Screen is not that good but then again , 50 dollars ? Buy it !!!! Give it a spin you won't be disappointed its very fast for such a small tablet ."
1,"Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping"
0,It is a lot more then I was after. I can watch my Netfix and do more
1,Great product. Enhances my TV options!! I enjoy the ability to have access to many programs when I want them.
1,I own an Apple TV also and content is just as good. Very easy to navigate. I also use my phone's app to navigate thru the menu.
1,Good project but not 5 star's. Product takes a lot of training to work or it'll tell you it can't find the answer.
1,"I bought this to listen to music. I do not use the Alexa feature all that much. The feature does work great, but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak. The speakers work great. I can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it. Bass is decent. I would recommend to someone."
1,She has dropped it a few times and the case is just great
1,"Good sound, learns more as you use it, can tell reasonably corny jokes, and Amazon come up with a new app almost weekly. Future is great for it. Got it on sale......if I could get that price again, I might get another one."
1,"Its amazing, super fast in response and will provide access to all your amazon content. If you are a prime member this is a must IMO!!"
1,Great device. I purchased this for my uncle. I have the same device and it works great for our needs. I use it mainly for games and reading.
1,I am late into the electronic age and this is simple enough and is great to use. I ask for certain music and it is played!!
1,"This is an awesome purchase if you already are an Amazon Prime Member. Easy to use, easy access to Amazon Prime music. Numerous choices available, just ask Alexa!"
1,Easy to maneuver through the various channels. This could replace my Satellite co.
1,This is a great tablet for my kid he can watch and play all the games for his age
1,"I mean it's a great product for what you get, little on the expensive side"
1,"Better than the Nook. I switched fro Glowlight Nook due the lack of previous features. The Nook did not improve, so I was forced to switch. I found in the kindle all I need plus more books from Amazon."
0,I have two amazon fire sticks. They were nice but kind of slow. Got this amazon fire tv box heard it ran faster which it does but the remote dies faster... A little over 30 days of course after the return period the remote sizzled. Good thing for the remote app.
0,"I will not recommend this one, do slow and I ended up returning this product"
1,"Got the most bang for the buck with this tablet. I would've given it 5 stars if it had Google play on it. Otherwise, it was quick with some of the apps that I downloaded on it."
1,"It's great, tons of functionality and the first step in cutting the satellite/cable cord!"
1,"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
0,"It is not as easy to use as my iPad. There is no Retina display , which I got used with my Apple gadgets"
1,"Bought the original Fire for my daughter a few years ago, and she unfortunately lost it in our out of state move. This updated version is a replacement for that and she couldn't be happier. Great for kid's to read books, stream movies and tv, or playing games."
1,"We bought this tablet for our 3yr old niece. She loves being on netflix & youtube and this does the trick!. We also bought one for our 9yr old niece and she loves to read & browse, she loved it. ! You can't beat the price, so far so good."
1,"Start and end my day with this device. Great way to start the party or just unwind. Reminders, ask questions, and even jeopardy are very useful."
1,This product is exactly as I expected it to be! No complaints!
1,"I had been reading on my iPad mini most of the time, but around the pool or at the beach, that was almost impossible. The Voyage is great not only in bright sunshine but inside, even in a pretty dark room. The back light is great for just about any environment. The battery life is fantastic."
1,works............................................................
1,Omg this product is excelent good batery and HD screen love this
1,Love the cost of the kindle! Great price for a tablet for children! Very user friendly!
1,"The Echo is a fun tech toy. We don't have blue-tooth lights or heating/ac, but we have been having fun with the music and games."
0,"The price was low, but the ads are really annoying to me. The tablet is good, works well. Doesn't seem to be able to use apps from Google Play store which was a surprise and disappointment to me. All in all, I would've chosen another android tablet."
1,"Great product and only $40! I purchased 2 of them along with the compatible SanDisk 200gb micro SD cards to max out the storage capability. I was able to copy my child's stored tv shows & moves on to the sd cards from my PC's hard drive, now they can watch their shows on the go, it makes car trips a lot easier! I also purchased Skullcandy Bluetooth headphones for each of them (got em' for $10 during Christmas). They paired with the Kindle in seconds, no trouble at all. + Kindle's customer support is awesome if you need them, their service is like no other..."
1,Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.
1,"My daughter love her tablet. And is easy to use, and the battery last longer.."
1,The product is quite nifty. I personally enjoy it. I feel as though it brings everyone in the house together even if we aren't in the same room.
1,"This was purchased for a infant who loves to watch Disney cartoons on YouTube, it works for what it's used for."
0,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.
1,great device. easy to use. smooth. snappy & full of content.
1,Wall charger is convenient. Just wish it was sold with the kindle instead of having to purchase it separate. Seems like it should be standard in the package. Had to purchase in a bundle in order to get it included with kindle.
1,Its an excellent tacky for the prices. It works well and the picture quality is excellent.
1,"Great for my 5 year old, but battery only lasts 7 hours if it's not being used!"
1,staff was great my son was very pleased with his purchase we shop at your store quite often love best buy
1,I love this thing its freakin awesome to own and fun
1,Echo was easy to set up. Works good. Wish it had more free music.
1,"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
1,I bought this because I have Amazon Prime. This was really easy to set up. Picture quality is excellent. Better than cable or satellite.
1,We were tired of cable failure via mediacom and we're looking for a cables and dish less tv system. A friend of one of our friends told us about the fire system. We went out and bought it then purchased sling. We are very pleased with this decision.
1,I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
1,For the price it works fairly well. I would recommend it for a novice or first time user.
1,"I like the ease of operation of this Kindle. Easy to read, easy to adjust, easy to obtain books quickly, Good place to store a library that you can take any place."
1,Granddaughter loved it! She began using it right away.
1,No problems with it at al. Worth the money. Would buy again.
1,"Easy to use, ton of cool kids features, awesome price"
1,Saw this on sale for $40 so i bought it.For that price it is a great tablet
1,"Love my Alexa! Love asking Alexa about the weather, traffic, etc."
1,"So, after visiting my sister and brother in law who use an Amazon Echo to run just about everything in their house, I just had to have one. I purchased my own Amazon Echo the minute I got home from my trip. I am now on my way to building my smart home. My wife and I have enjoyed using Alexa to help us with recipe measurements, check the weather for the day, set reminders and play our favorite music.We are now working toward building and buying items such as wifi light switches, a smart thermostat and a few other items that will all work seamlessly with Alexa. It will take a while to get it all done but it is a lot of fun!! The Amazon Echo is such a blast to use. Take your first step in building your smart home with the purchase of an Amazon Echo!"
1,It's super easy to use and lightweight!! I love my new Kindle!
1,Device is preloaded with many friendly apps that are easy to use.
1,"Bought this tablet for my 7yr old daughter for Christmas. I love that it's not overly complicated but not kiddy as well. Overall, awesome tablet for everyone."
1,"Great to download books, movies, music. Easy to navigate. Would recommend!!!!#"
1,"Compared to products of the same, my Amazon Echo is the very best!! Ordering through Best Buy was effortless & efficient."
1,"Everything we watch is on here. From Amazon, Netflix and everything in between we have access to all our favorite apps and content."
1,Very pleased with product. I was also a decent price and not overpriced.
1,"Neighbor has one, and just loves it. So I bought one."
1,Good product great price.best buy rep was good help
1,"It's just what I was looking for, something simple and inexpensive. Plus I got it for $35 on black friday."
1,"I had an old (non-backlit) Kindle and loved it. When this one went on sale I bought one for my son (an avid reader like me) and he liked it so much I bought one for my wife next time it went on sale. I was going to get one for myself but the sale ended. I forgot about it, just kept using my old Kindle. Then lo and behold it went on sale again so I ran out and finally got one for myself. Keep in mind my primary use of it is as an e-reader and for that I can't imagine a better device. I can also pop online and check my email etc but I only do that when I'm on a secure WIFI (e.g. at home or a friends; I don't use hotel etc even if there is a 'password' because shared WIFI's are insecure). So for $40 it can't be beat."
1,The echo is a great product for anyone! Love being able to find answers to all my questions so fast!
1,Works great! My echo answers all my questions. Very happy I purchased it!
1,"Bought 4 of these on Thanksgiving Eve. With their price that night, they were an amazing gift for my daughter's Christmas gift exchange, a donation to a less fortunate family, and kept one for me. I can only speak for the one I kept, but it's a great little, easy to hold device for reading."
1,"I purchased the Paperwhite specifically because I want to be able to read in bright sunlight. I bought this around Christmas time so I have not been near a pool deck yet, but I assume it will do what it is advertised as. It has a six inch screen, a bit small for me, but I do like it. It's lightweight so you can put it in a handbag and not feel weighted down. The only thing I don't like is that the screen is black and white, not color like my Kindle Fire. That took some getting used to but I look forward to laying by the pool and reading a good book while getting some sun!"
1,It's a positive addition to the household. I enjoy having Alexa around the house.
1,Excellent price and recommendable for kids & family...
1,The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
1,"I use Prime, Hulu and Netflix for my TV and movie needs. I also own two firesticks already. I wanted one with 4K support for a 4K tv. If u need 4K and want a slightly faster Fire streaming device, go with the player. Otherwise the Firestick is more than adequate for streaming needs."
1,"So glad I bought the Kindle Paperwhite. I like that it has a built in light, and I can manually adjust it to my liking."
0,"After using IPAD, it is weird to see flickers while reading on a small screen. However, it was recommended by a friend of mine who thinks it is easy on eyes. Battery lasts long and you can download work related pdfs to read later. (my main purpose to buy was to read docs offline) Redundant if you have kindle on ipad/other tabs."
1,Great product for price. Holds its own against many in Higher price range. Love it...
1,Best product in the market! I love it and recommended to everyone!
1,Like the voice command option to search for shows I want to watch.
1,The Kindle Fire tablet is no cheap Android tablet -- it is snappy and responsive. The price is unbeatable! More than an e-Reader!
0,"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse."
1,I was iffy on buying this or not but decided to go ahead and purchase this a little over a month ago. I love the echo from the basic commands to just using it to listen to music. The sound quality for music is pretty good it's enough for what I use it for. Would definitely recommend
1,The Kindle is so easy to read in all lighting situations. The E-Ink screen is responsive and quick to touch controls.
1,Looking for ways to save on cable. Still required cable account to access many of the apps.
1,My grandson is 2 years old and loves his tablet. I do recommended for young kids
1,Amazon Echo is definitely the cat's meow in smart speakers. So far I've not had any issues in set up or use. Great speaker
1,"Got this for my eight year old son. But wanted to keep it for myself after testing it out. Good graphics, camera front and rear. Camera resolution as good as could be expected for 50 bucks. Access to play store apps a plus. All in all good 50 bucks spent."
1,Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
1,I cant ask for more for this price! very please with the Kindle Fire features
1,So much fun. I continue receiving updates. I do have to continue reading new things to do with it.
1,Excellent e-reader. Works well day or night. New built in web browser works.
1,I bought this new Kindle Fire HD 8 just to have a larger device. I've had a 7 for many years and love it. This is just a case of size does make a difference. The only downside is that the multiple chargers I've got don't fit the 8 so I'm left with just the one that came with the device.
1,This is a really good tablet for young kids that loves kids apps.
1,I only bought this tablet to pair specifically with a Bose Wireless Speaker. I was able to download the music I wanted and it pairs beautifully. Really sleek & simple.
1,"Bought this to keep all my ebooks on to carry in my purse. So I could read when was stuck at the hospital, etc.Well, gee the free wifi at the hospital has a sign-on screen. Couldn't get to that. Did some reading (on my phone) I think I can fix it the next time I need to be there. Just disappointed that it wouldn't allow the sign-on page to display right out of the box!!!"
1,is no word happy happy it hard to get up cause there no commercial so l have to fix something to eat before watching a move or do what l need to do frist so many movies it hard to pick what to watch
1,We canceled cable TV 3 years ago because of the rising cost. With Amazon TV we can subscribe to Sling and get our favorite cable shows for 15% of the cost.
1,I was hesitant at first about this...but it turns out to be more than I expected. My only complaint is not getting it sooner.
1,"Bought the kindle tablet for my granddaughter and she loves it. I have one myself and I'm always using it when I can. My grandsons want one now. You can read books, play games and use the internet."
1,"I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
1,"I would def buy this product, works like a charm. Don't buy anything other than a fire tv"
1,"Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv."
1,I've started to allow this device to grow on me. Yes I saw some color variation but either my eyes have adjusted or it's gone away. I'm back to reading like I used to and love it!
1,"I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned."
1,This tablet is for my mom who only knows the basics of technology. You can play games on it and social networks easily. Anything more advanced I wouldn't recommend. Great product starter tablet for am amazing price.
1,"I would have given this 5 stars but the touch response isn't always responsive. Sometimes it acts like it is frozen, and then it turns the page after several seconds.I like the new features over the paper white as well. I love you don't have to pick up your fingers to turn the page."
1,"$35 tablet, its a no brainer. great gift for the kids"
1,Great tablet for the money. Slimmer and lighter weight than my previous Samsungs.
1,i would recomend this product to anybody kids and adults
1,This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.
1,I love the tablet . now i have time to catch up with my reading and tv shows and also facebook and magazines
1,With a job on the cutting edge of tech stuff I wanted to experience the Echo and Alexa. Oddly my wife who is not tech focused loves talking to Alexa to get her favorite radio station or music to play. Right now it's a novelty - unnecessary but fun. As we increase our smart home I think the echo will be the center of it.
1,"Excellent tablet for a young child that is very durable, expandable, inexpensive and my grand daughter loves it."
1,"gave item as a gift, bought on Black Friday at a great price."
1,Root to cyanogenmod and it becomes a good inexpensive android tablet.
0,"The Kindle Paper white is excellent for reading; however: 1. Product needs to be able to shut OFF! Very unhappy about this. Advertising says will hold charge for weeks - not so, when Kindle paperwhite cannot be shut down. It only holds a charge for a few days, if you read for a couple of hours each day. 2. I have books that I do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. I am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud - IT SHOULD BE EASIER!! Amazon made it easy to change Kindle's when I purchased a new one. All Kindle's should be user friendly. Sadly, this is not the case, with the Paperwhite."
1,"This device is great for watching tv shows, movies, or sports without having to be locked in a subscription."
1,Very useful to keep my little cousins occupied with educational games
1,Good tablet. Easy to use. Good for anyone who likes to read.
1,"Easy to install and easy to use. I bought the white one, matches my floor, so it looks perfect. I love the sound quality and the many things Alexa can help you out all day. Weather, music, read books, the news, etc... I like to multi task and not having to stop something I'm doing to play a new song or find out what's the time in Barcelona is super helpful. I just use my voice to ask Alexa. Simple as that. I'm handling my cell phone much less and I love that."
1,I absolutely love my firebox. Its convenient and easy to use. Great for watching movies with the kids and family. I have not had any problems with it and Alexa is a great addition.
1,This is my second Echo and I also have purchased 2 of the small ones. They are great and will buy more for gifts this Christmas.
1,A great tablet for my son. It has YouTube and parental controls as well as time limits.
1,"Let me start by saying I hardly ever get to use the Amazon Echo...my kids have taken over and talk to ""Alexa"" like their long lost sister. every morning ""Alexa, what is the weather"", ""Alexa, play xxx song"" and so on. It has been a great addition to our smart electronics and we are continuing to learn new things about the echo and how to add an increasing number of other items to the controls. Very fun and very useful at the same time."
1,it works fine... it's a charger!!
1,"I purchased this kindle to replace a very old and heavy Nook! Kindle is lightweight , easy to use and perfect for travel. Holds a charge forever!"
1,This is my favorite kindle so far. The size is perfect and the weight is minimal. I love the fact it is back lit and I don't need a book light.
1,I love the kindles fires and all Amazon echos have bought for other family members highly recommend
1,Great product...no problems at all. If your looking for a great media streaming look no further than the Amazon Fire TV.
1,Fun to use and learning more applications by the day. great product!
1,I had previously purchased the fire stick. It works good and had what you need. I bought the TV model. It's super fast. I love it and would highly recommend it!
1,I like the tablet . It is vary good for reader who likes to read .my kids read books on it alot.
1,"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
1,"Its Really amazing device, i really like it. its working flow less."
1,"I love my kindle voyage. I get distracted when I read on my tablet, so I decided to purchase an eReader. I am very happy I did! I hope to meet my reading challenge now!"
0,Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
1,"Great product for readers, low on eyes. Takes time to get used to."
1,Very Easy to Set-up and link to your Devices- user friendly.
1,Great easy to use tablet.... Grabbed it for my daughter and she cant get enough. Gets the job done ...
1,My son is 6 and I can control everything he does on his tablet! I love it and love that learning games came installed
1,This piece of technology is amazing. It works great for me since I have it hooked up directly to an Ethernet cable. It also works great with the wifi. I've since cancelled my cable & use all the amazing apps to watch live tv.
1,Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader.
1,"Works well. Easy to install. Great features include Alexa, connection to Amazon, Netflix, movies I can't find elsewhere, music, and more"
0,"I'm giving it three stars because I haven't used it much, only to watch a few shows and movies.I've had it for aprox. a month and sometimes the screen goes blank, I have no idea why...is it the tablet?...or maybe the app?...clueless... I'm not making a big deal of it because I bought it on Black Friday (not that I have money to waste), but I don't think I'd buy it again."
1,Has been on my granddaughters kindle for many month and still working great
1,Upgraded my FireStickTV to the Fire TV box. Much happier with the direct connect versus Wi-Fi.
1,Great device for an extra set up in the house and to use when phone is not handy
1,Quality of kindle is pretty okay. Just wish charge would last more than 2 hours when child is playing games after being fully charged.
1,The reading seems to be clearer than the other version. It is much lighter.The Wi-Fi connection seems to be better.
1,"If you have Hulu, Netflix, amazon prime, etc... get this because you can control all of them from this device it's awesome and faster than the Fire stick and you can play games too gotta get the game controller totally worth it"
1,Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
1,"Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot."
0,Purchased for my kids but it was hard to navigate and ended up with purchasing an iPad
1,"My daughter loves this. She uses it for both games and educational apps, as well as listen to music."
1,This is a great alternative to cable/box. Saves $.
1,Great product. Live the amazon customer service as well. User friendly. Parental controls best I've seen.
1,I love the Amazon Fire TV. This is a great device!
0,I was excited about purchasing the Amazon echo but when I received it after about 2 weeks I had to return it because a lot of times Alexa did not hear me or understand what I asked.
0,"Bought this item with high expectations of its capabilities. It would be extremely lenghty to supply full details, let me just say that technology is not there yet with AI devices like this...."
0,"This product is what you pay for. Got it on black Friday at less than 40 dollars. It uses are basic and good for my kids. If you need a babysitter, it comes into play for an hour. Battery life is pretty good"
1,I am very happy about this Amazon tablet purchase at Best Buy and it is working great.
1,"I enjoyed my kindle for years, but was a bit frustrated by needing a light on at night. Kindle paperwhite is a dream with its built in backlight. Not only can I read at night, but it is easier to read in daylight if the light is dim. The convenient size, ability to change fonts, font size and light intensity are super features!"
1,"Gotten for my granddaughter and she uses it all the time. Other than having to charge so much because of frequent use, there have been no problems with it. Good purchase!"
1,I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.
1,"Used with Playstation Vue, this box rocks. It's fast. Plus, when fast forwarding to skip commercials, you actually get to see what corresponds to the timeline, unlike the Roku Streaming Stick, which only shows the current image plus how many minutes ahead or back you can go (not the image, just the increment). With the Fire TV, you actually see the exact minute and second on the timeline along with the image at that time. Plus, Fire TV lets you fast forward up to 64x actual speed."
1,"It's great to read either in the day or at night. It's light and has nice feeling of touch. My friends bought their kindle long time ago, and I just got mine. The design and everything is better and better. I love kindle paperwhite than the basic one. I would highly recommend it to my other friends if they don't have one."
1,I really like how small it is and the fact that the screen is in color.
1,"For the price you can't beat this little tablet, it does an awesome job!"
1,A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while.
1,I love the picture quality. Sometimes losing internet connection. I wish it has Time Warner App.
1,gave this as a gift and she seems to like it and using it often
1,I left my Paperwhite on a plane. I loved it so much I bought the same one again. No need to buy newer models. This works.
1,Nice product and a good companion for anyone who need to be entertained.
1,love the color. easily to navigate and add apps. need a memory card though.
1,Great.I love it..Im glad I got it..My nephew loves it.
1,New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.
0,Never bought this item at all. So i guess you must have the wrong person
1,"We have this to our kids as their Christmas gift. Not only were the apps good, but you're able to set up separate profiles for each user as well as usage timers so they don't get stuck on it for hours."
1,Amazing product and alternative for cable. The fire TV has a lot of add ons so you can watch your favorite shows through this little box! Loved it!
1,"I read often and love this e-reader. I previously had a nook and liked it, but it was old and did not have night reading option. The voyage is light and easy to hold. The backlighting is great at night. Overall very happy with this product for reading."
1,I bought 2 of these on Black Friday becasue the price was amazing! I kept one for myself and gave the other one away as a raffle prize for our Christmas party. The recipient was really excited to get it and I like mine so far. It was pretty awesome to be able to get a reputable tablet for such a low price. Awesome buy!!!
1,Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.
1,"Excellent tablet for the money! Best for amazon prime members, although even non prime amazon users can make the most out of this tablet at this price point."
1,I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
1,I started with a very old original kindle. Amd have been debating for... Well months if I should upgrade. I kept putting it off. My husband tells me I was dropping subtle hints all the time and he finally decided to pick it up for me and surprise me with it! I was at first a little put off with the rather high price but honestly once I started reading and playing with it... It is definitely worth it! This version more than the $200 one fits my style and in my opinion is better than the pricier one. You won't be disappointed!
1,"Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either."
1,It still has some things that needs to be updated. Does not know a lot of things when asked. Great for music in the room.
1,Wanted something small and this was perfect size .
1,Had this for a month now. Works perfect. Just saw an email informing me that it works with Echo devices now. Can't wait to try it.
1,This was a Christmas gift for a toddler. He loves this gift.
0,I brought tablet for my 3 yr old son. It was okay for him but I wasn't crazy about the amazon apps. It was a decent tablet though for that price.
1,"This is a great android tablet. On top of it on black friday it is 34.99$ i bought a couple for my son.They abuse it and it is well worth having a backup and it is so cheap you can afford to break a couple.You can side load google appstore, just google it."
1,This purchase was a gift for 10 year old. Today's technology enhances the youth of today. This tablet is definitely a winner.
1,Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
1,The Amazon Echo is a terrific tech addition. These devices work off your router and the vast variety of information and radio stations makes the Echo a versatile item to have.
0,Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
1,Purchased for myself and just love it! It's just as nice as the Kindle.
1,love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
1,"Great for playing music and keeping lists. Have not tried all the fancy reorder item feature, but Alexa's features keep expanding, so the possibilities are constantly expanding."
1,Wife uses it every day and says she loves it. Very happy with the purchase.
1,I had just about every android box out there and this is my favorite. I hate the fire stick but love this.if you want something that works great get this.
1,Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
1,From what I can tell my kids love these. I do wish there was an option to keep it on the kids profile though
1,Bought it as a gift for my mom she loves it and uses it all the time
1,just what is needed!
1,I started with the dot and I'm glad I upgraded the sound quality is way better she hears me when I Call her name It's a big difference
1,I was amazed everything I could do with this Amazon Fire TV! Loved the relibility and ease of use. Plus with the RF remote I can hide this behind my TV.
1,"This was a bday gift and I absolutely love it! She tells jokes, plays music and much much more! Fun for the entire family or just some relaxing down time!"
1,my wife bought this product for my office. I love to play songs and get the weather.
1,"Didn't know how many lingering questions I had until I got an Amazon Echo. I mean, every little thing I want to know, I now just ask and hope Alexa knows. Very helpful to just get a quick answer to most things."
1,This product cuts our cable bill in half! Quality is great. You can literally watch anything old or new!
1,Love the tablet. It's easy to watch your favorite shows
1,It's a great device that lets you do stuff without getting off your couch or leaving your bed. My lights and fan can be turned on and off by my voice. I set my alarm daily just telling her to set it and the time. My tv can be controlled with my Alexa. You can use as an intercom system if you have in several rooms which I do. The only complaint I have is that sometimes I have to repeat myself a few times for it to pick up what I am saying. But not enough to worry about. B
1,"I was totally stoked about this product because I was purchasing a new home. However, the property fell through and I returned the product but the little bit I had it...I loved it!!"
1,Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.
1,"I was happy with my Kindle Touch, but then started to envy people with Paperwhite who read in dark. I love my new Kindle, take it everywhere and can read books with any light."
1,My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books
1,Got two for my kids for Christmas and they're awesome! And also got lucky they scanned to $20 less than advertised price! Woo!
1,Had been.looking at this item on Amazon and hoped it would go in sale. It did and I was able to purchase at Best Buy.
1,"If you want a tablet that is current and works well with the android platform and that you won't have a coronary when you kid drops on the floor, in the toilet, or anywhere then this is for you. We have 4 total and Amazon service if you have any issues is second to none. They even replaced previous ones for free when the charging port got loose but it seems that is now a problem of the past."
1,I love the feature it can add events to my g mail calendar. Wish it would sync iPhone calendar. Great and easy to use
1,I bought Geek Squad for 2 years. Well after 13 months my device became broken. So the warranty came in handy. Thank you knowing things happend in life.
1,I love my fire tablet so much I have 6 of them. Well worth the $50!
1,"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!"
1,It is small enough to carry along on my daily routine. The price was right too.
1,"Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!"
1,"Bought for home automation, but havent gotten that far yet. Good for music, books, weather, etc."
1,This was an awsome purchase glad i made it will recommend
1,I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!
1,It's great thing to use. I use it for everything even working out
1,"I bought this tablet because of its size, makes a perfect cheap ereader plus can do lots of other tablet tasks. Highly recommend this for everyone wanting a good cheap tablet"
1,"I was looking for the Amazon-Echo, for awhile and Best-Buy had a great price so I bought it,don't know why I Waited so long to buy it. Use it so much I bought a Amazon-Echo Dot for my wife's business, We like it a lot!!!! GREAT JOB BEST BUY!!!"
1,I can listen to music during my bath. Also there are 39 games I can play and 40 I can't play yet. I am six.
1,I bought this for my wife. She had an older 1st gen reader from another company and the differences are astounding. Setup was easy and getting content could not be easier.The unit is light. Really light. Compared to an iPad it is truly air (pun).It works well in any light condition so far.The navigation is a little squirrelly and takes getting used to and there can be a slight delay after a press so that can take getting used to.
1,"The Echo is a great speaker with clear sound that reaches from one room to another. The biggest problem that I have had us getting it to work with the Nest thermostat. The thermostat must be registered under the same email account as the echo, otherwise the Echo cannot remotely control it."
1,It works.
1,Great product but only as good as what you have to sync to it.
1,"I held off purchasing the echo for many reasons, not the least of which was the uncertainty about the state of voice recognition and AI accurate responsiveness. My only regret now is that I didn't buy the echo sooner than I did. I love her, I mean it! Every day I'm integrating the echo into my life and into my home more and more. I even purchased a second one for the bedroom. The one drawback is that I sometimes have to repeat myself a few times before I'm understood. I have found that the more voice training I do, the less frequent I have this problem. And, right out of the box I was surprised at just how accurately Alexa understood and instantly responded with relevant, accurate, and timely information. Yes, I am crazy 'bout Alexa! 8)"
1,"I've used a Kindle fire for years and love it but wanted something more light weight to use specifically for reading books. The Paperwhite is very light weight and it's easy to use. The touch screen is not always as responsive as I'd like it to be when on the home screen or managing your library, but once you've opened a book, it's easy on the eyes and page turning is very responsive. I'm glad I have this option for reading as it's much better than reading on the Fire. If you want a full tablet, get a Fire but it you just want to read, the Paperwhite is great."
1,"Very valueble product, very easy to use, many features, way better than the stick, wont be disappointed."
1,Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features.
1,"The extra money for the Voyage version is well worth it, as the screen is brighter, clearer, and easier on the eyes. The other specs are also nicer compared to other Kindle versions, but the screen is what sold me."
1,Love this item. Plays my favorite music and shows. Can get up to date traffic and weather.
1,"Wanted too try something different instead of apple, this purchase is amazing, some shows are down loaded in Full 4 k amazing picture. Great purchase"
1,Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
1,Gift to my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it. Works great. I also purchased a stand for Alexa and gives it support.
0,for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
1,Bought the tablet for my son and he loves it. very affordable and worth the money.
1,"This box is wonderful, meets my expectations plus some. I gave up cable and tried it. I don't watch a lot of movies but this box comes with a lot of selections in my opinion more than basic cable, and if you have prime even more selections, theres a lot of free shows just download the apps for them."
1,"Nice product.My kids love it,good for YouTube search."
1,Great for my 12 year old for games and the like. Spending $15 at Amazon to remove ads is worth it. Don't like that you have to turn on tracking from some of the free games from the Amazon store.
1,"I bought it during Black Friday cause it was cheap and on sale. In the end, it was a really good buy! There's a lot you can do/add to the tablet, yet it has an external memory! Jut look into what you can do to this tablet, and you'll fall in love!"
1,No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.
1,Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
1,"it is a wonderful little box ,watching movies and tv shows on it is great.l love it"
1,Works GREAT! Better then cable! I would recommend to everyone!
1,Alexa is great for quick info and sometimes her responses to questions are fun to listen to.
1,"They just keep getting better. My wife used her original kindle with a book light, the lighting is so good on this one it's by by book light. The battery life is amazing"
1,It appears to be much faster than the firestick. I can access movies without it having to buffer.
1,It is an outstanding product to use for automated home system and hands free music playing from smart device
1,amazon kindle fire 7 inch is a super buy . works great .
1,Had a Google Nexus which I really liked but started having issues with the power connection. After replacing the USB connector I still had issues with it so I decided to replace it. Did my research and purchased a Kindle Fire and loved it so much I bought two more to give to my parents.
1,"I love my Echo! I received it as a gift in 2015, and purchased it as a gift to give in 2016. WIN - WIN item that all ages and lifestyles can enjoy. Weather, news, music, and more ... Alexa is there! She even gets a few laughs when she responds to the TV commercials using her name. Yes, buy it for all the right reasons!"
1,"Amazon Fire tablet has been working well. It seems to hold battery charge reasonably well. It wouldn't be great for the youngest kids due to all the amazon product advertisements, but great for him."
1,This tablet has been a huge lifesaver. Not only do I have movies for my son on my tablet but I also have my games and his games so it keeps the whole family happy. It's super user-friendly so even my one year old can figure it out. Connecting to Wi-Fi is super simple and it has amazing features. The speakers on it are amazing. I catch things in the movies we watch more on this tablet than I do on my own TV. All around family friendly tablet.
1,Alexa is fun but not able to be customized to play your favorite song or tell wife hello hubby loves you
1,Love this set up. More movies and TV than I can watch.
1,I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!
1,Easy to use. Easy to setup. Great video quality...
0,Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net. I can ask the same question the same way & you always get an answer with Siri but not with Alexia. It always say I do not understand the question. Again this thing needs much improvement & it's not worth the price tag especially when Siri is included with my iPhone.
1,Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day
1,Love the Kindle Fire. Was a previous Nook user. This is so much better and am so much more happier with it.
1,You don't need cable service anymore that means you can save money with this :)
1,It's a really great tablet for Ebook exploring great
1,"great product, i would recommend this product to family and friends"
1,"I gave these tablets to my g/daughters and there is so much that they can do with it. They come with great apps, which I think they will enjoy for years to come. Also the price was great bargain."
0,Has every feature a android phone would have. I mainly got it for Ebooks and it works great for that. However if your coming from a iOS device I don't suggest switching to this.
1,"I bought this for my mother during Mother's Day and I got a $10 off.Overall I paid around $42 for the tablet. Best tablet money can buy. It includes YouTube,Pandora and all the other good apps you get on a normal cell phone. I bought other cheap tablets on the past for a much higher price and less the quality."
1,I was surprised with the quality of this product and although is true it doesn't have as many apps as Roku is still excellent.
1,I just love the size of the kindle and it's easy to take on the go. Perfect reading for outdoors on the deck around the pool.
1,"Even though I'm an apple lover, I've turned to the firestick and fire tv for internet access on 4 tv's in my house. Very happy with the ease of set up and the performance."
0,"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
1,Little bit slow but perfect fit for my 6years old daughter.
1,Amazon does everything well. This is a terrific product installs easily and you don't need to be a tech guru to use it.
1,"I love this kindle, the price is good, not too heavy and I charge once every two weeks"
1,Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
1,You can't got wrong with a tablet for less than $60 capable of watching movies and play games. Perfect for kids.
1,"Music and timers, jokes and light controls, at first it seems like a might be nice to have and then you realize just how much it really can do and you need it..."
1,"Purchased as a gift so I cannot review this product. However, I have an older version Kindle Reader which I love!"
1,"This is the best gift anyone could receive, talks to you, wakes you up, sings you to sleep, turns lights off. I love this thing!"
1,"Loved my Amazon Echo, had to get one for each of my family members too."
1,Bought this as well as the Roku ultra.. Both are great products no issues whatsover.. If ur a bit more advanced Fire TV is more modifiable as its based on Android while Roku isnt. but still Fire TV is very simple for the basic use of even my 4 year old kid... Alexa is a great plus only one downside is it doesn't navigate within Apps to control the apps themselves it only controls Fire TVs main features... While in Roku the direct netflix button on the remote makes it slightly simpler to access netflix.. In short both are amazing products so if ur comparing u wont go wrong either way.. I would highly recommend Fire TV and am very pleased with my purchase
1,it a lot different from the Roku . but it get the fob done
1,Very cool to be able to give voice instructions and get news and music via voice. Works great
1,love it......................small and efficient..
1,I bought this few months back. Its really useful which travelling. I connect to Wifi in flights and watch movies. No need to carry laptop. Its really affordable too.
1,"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you."
1,Got this for my grandma after I Bought One now she loves it
1,I really like reading paper white. I wish it listed the books the way my kindle fire dose like in a book case. But all and all I'm very happy with the paper white kindle
1,I wasn't expecting much for the price but I really enjoy using it. I mainly play games on this device. I would totally recommend this device to anyone.
1,"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly."
1,Bought this for my 8 year old son. This was his second tablet. Just his speed.
1,"My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints."
1,Very affordable and it works. I bought this for my kids and they like it.
1,"Love using this. So easy to download and find books, so easy to store, the battery life is amazing. It's like reading a book without the hassle of the space, being able to look up words while reading it amazing. The only thing I wish is that I had gotten one sooner!"
1,Great unit at a great price for reading and storing recipes and cooking.
1,I bought this new paperwhite after using the regular kindle for a long time. I am amazed by the light weight and the ease of use. The battery makes a huge difference as well. Love it!!!!
1,This is my second echo and I have a dot as well. Great product. Love everything it can do including keeping up with my shopping list. Love these!
1,Love it. I am reading all the time now! And I never used to read so much.
1,"We got this tablet for our grandkids for Christmas so they would leave their parents phones alone. This way they can play all the games that they want on a device that is not quite as pricey as the smartphones. They love the tablet, but we needed to block the purchases from our grandson who is only 4, as he downloaded a game on Christmas that was not free before we could stop him. Our fault."
1,My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase.
0,The amazon echo does what it's supposed to do. I wish it could call 911.
1,So helpful to power up our readers anywhere.
1,Using the unit to play games and read. Good Enjoyed using
1,I have 2 firestick and now the fire tv..i have it hooked to to my UHD tv and it's great.
1,"The greatest kindle I have ever owned, Would be great for kids also"
1,"Easy to use, handle and screen is perfect for a toddler."
1,"Convenient, functional, practical device! I loved this product!"
1,"Amazon's voice-activated smart home speaker is undeniably futuristic, but it's also practical and accessible. With a rapidly growing slate of features, integrations and use cases, it's easy to get excited about the Echo's potential."
1,"Easy to use day or night, Charge lasts a long time. Kindle much better than my I pad as a reader"
1,"My family loves the Kindle Paperwhite. Prefer to read on this more than the fruity tablet. Great for outside, so my dog loves it too!! Lightweight, easy to use, lots of books to choose from. No complaints."
1,This makes tv more fun easy setup just plug and play.
0,At first I thought is was going to be great because of all the apps it had. Late I discover that all of those great apps I felt in love with needed to be purchased and pay a membership. Even though it was good for a first time tablet.
1,"Amazing tablet, great quality and great features!!"
1,This model has an excellent screen resolution and size. Very easy to use and navigate the functions. Web browser works great. The backlight is super helpful and does great in the sun for outdoor reading. It's small and lightweight size make it easy for me to carry in my purse. I would recommend this to anyone
1,"It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
1,"easy to buy on line and store, fast shipping and pack out good"
1,Love that Prime membership allows me to see all other movies...bye bye Netflix
1,"Works just as well as my Rokus, however the interface is completely awful. Buy the fire for kodi buy a roku for everything else."
1,I gave this Fire 7 tablet to a good friend for Christmas. All she had was a smart phone before and it is pretty small. She just loved the ease of setting it up and uses it all the time now. So much easier to navigate than her phone. Now she can lad books and read for a lot cheaper than buying them in the stores. She said she couldn't have received a better gift.
1,Upgraded from a Kindle paperwhite. I love the brighter screen and increased resolution. I am a book addict and the savings over printed material allows me to buy more books. The availability of reference texts is increasing which is a big plus.
1,"Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it."
1,Got it for my kids to use instead of my iPads :P they like it and I also got one for myself to stick in my pocket when heading out the door so that I don't have to take my iPad/s with me :]
1,My Kindle is a great addition to my Kindle'family' . I now have two that I use and enjoy.
1,"nice gadget to play with. we mostly use it for playing music on pandora but it has many more functions. conversions, timer are 2 useful examples. great as a gift for someone who has it all"
1,The Echo is used all day long. Alexa responds to an amazing number of requests. One item of concern is the grandkids commands to Alexa - need to figure a way to block kids.
0,Bought it so my son would stop grabbing for my phone. Does what it needs to but battery life is horrible
1,I love my kindle paper white and its easy to use 5W USB charger.
1,"Small, lightweight, well priced, a great entry tablet."
1,"Really easy to set up. New skills offered regularly. Especially like the ""Butler"" app that can re mind me of where I left my keys!"
0,"Seems like a good value, though I'm not sure how much it allows Amazon to spy on me. Major problem, does not connect my WIFI at home. My Android and Lap Top connect; and the Fire connects elsewhere, not sure if it's a WIFI problem or a Fire problem. Will contact Amazon to see if they can tell. Otherwise I would recommend."
1,Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!
1,My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
1,"We bought these knowing we had a couple of long plane rides ahead of us...we have not regretted them one bit. They are easy to use for the kids, come with lots of fun apps/games/books...Best part for us was being able to add a memory card, so we could add movies and as many apps as we needed without worrying about space."
1,Easy to use and install Love it I get to stream almost everything
1,My granddaughter was thankful for this. Pinks her favorite color and she's amazed with everything she can do on it
1,"Bought a 2 blacks, blue & orange. These tablets are amazing & awesome price. I would like to purchase a purple one for myself."
1,The Echo is really cool. We use it to control the lights and listen to music all the time.
0,My daughter's Google tablet had run its course so I purchased this. I miss the simplicity of android.
1,"Sturdy construction, withstands toddlers use or (abuse)"
1,"With parental controls, this is a great tablet for my grandson to use!"
0,Bad graphics. Ugly design. Good for the price. Not recommended.
0,"Screen, camera, and processor don't perform too well but for the price you pay, it's definitely a bargain."
1,"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
1,"It's prefect for everyone, from my kids to us adults less tech savvy!"
1,Surprisingly good picture quality and easy to use.
1,"Good sound. family has fun playing games, listening to music and got an opportunity to use amazon at a great price!"
1,I have a 3 year old at home. Best purchase ever! Indestructible. Reliable. Easy to program. I would highly recommend this.
1,I bought it for my son. He loved it. I just don't like he can read my books at Amazon. I should be able create a sub account and limit it.
1,I like it a lot. It does what it says it will do and that's awesome.
0,"Purchased this to mainly read books after my Nook died. Can't beat the price, but the print quality isn't as good as some other tablets. It's more like black on grey as oppose to crisp white. It can be a little difficult to read from versus the higher price tablets."
1,"I love my fire tablet, use it everyday from mail to games"
1,"When compared to Google home, echo is good for connecting smart devices. If you are on amazon ecosystem then this is a great product. I like google home over echo due to the natural english speaking ability and conversation that i can have and get responses back."
1,"This was a gift for my boyfriend. He usually has apple products but I bought him this tablet and he loves it. It's easy to watch his videos, browse the web and even download books."
1,It is light and easy to carry. I can read books everywhere now.
1,It's really great and I like the color but there is a crack on the screen protector. I don't know it's the shipment or I squeezed it.
1,Right out of the box this will be a family hit for all.
1,"Had the Fire stick before, which is very good but this is great. Much faster. Able to plug ethernet cables in and not rely on wireless. My buy another!"
1,"recommend it to anyone, always find something good to watch and very portable."
1,Love this speaker it sounds great and love controlling it without having to touch it
1,Its a great tablet. Its easy to use and connect to wifis.
1,"I own a a previous model of the kindle and like that. I thought it couldn't get any better. Them I found this its touch screen and it lights up. So you literally can read it anytime, in the light in the dark. I use it everyday."
1,"Bought this tablet for my son..great battery life, shipped fast..great value!"
1,I bought this echo dot as a fourth member to our echo family. I absolutely love it.
1,Tablet is very good. Initial setup was easy.It connects fast to wireless network. There is also not much blotware installed. Verry good tablet for basic needs.
1,My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.
0,"I returned this and purchased the 4th generation Apple TV instead, I liked the Apple features better. If you're not"
1,My daughter loves this and.enjoys the free books on AmaZon
1,Wanted something cheap to bring on flights and this did not disappoint. Battery life is good and screen is average at best.
1,"Alexa is very useful at home. It helps you to play music, set up time, checklists to do, etc"
1,In general it is very good.I would like that the start button would be at the same place as the iPad one.I like that we have sample during 9hours free.
1,Great black Friday deal. Love the tablets. Recommended
1,It's better than the 1st version kindle with Internet access
1,exactly as I expected. Backlight is great and easy to use
1,I like best by becouse they are aforedabul and cuvenet and easy to get to.
1,This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..
1,It's an AC adapter. Does it work ok YES. I have about a half dozen of these around the house. I didn't need to buy this.
1,Amazon echo was a great choice. Get your money's worth.
1,"My daughter loves it, except that she can't connect to her chromecast"
1,"Great for my dad, who has trouble with smaller print. He has had no problems setting it up and getting started."
1,I bought this item to catch up on my book series which was easy to find with the built in amazon book store app. It also has great apps for games and anything you are looking for. I definitely recommend this. its a great deal at a great price.
1,GREAT FOR BUISNESS IF YOUR INTO WORKING CONSTRUCTION
1,Great product. I love it. Best thing I every got. I would recommend.mend this product to everyone.
1,Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads
1,Great apps for music and overall very fast and satisfying.
1,bought the fire - 7 tablet for our granddaughter. she loves it
1,"The Echo is a great addition to my home. It's convenient when we need specific information without logging on to the computer. I'm a Star Trek fan & being able to change the command to ""computer"" is priceless!"
1,"I bought 3 of these tablets on Black Friday. 1 for my oldest son to replace a Tablet he had damaged awhile ago, one for my toddler son who has begun to enjoy using my wife's tablet for Sesame, Thomas, etc, and one for myself since they were such a good buy. Since we have Amazon Prime and Netflix, I must say that this thing comes in pretty handy!"
1,Easy to teach my Mom how to work. Camera not good.
1,The fire box is just what I wanted! It lets me not worry about missing my favorite shows and movies
1,"I've been wanting a Kindle Paperwhite for a while, putting off buying some books I want to read because I didn't want to be carrying all that weight with me when I'm traveling. I'm so glad I finally got it! I loaded the books on, and it's been really easy to use. The controls are intuitive, and the light is great. Easy to use, easy to read on it."
1,Bought the tablet at a great price. Wish i would have gotten more
1,"I had the first generation FireTV and it was great. I wanted something that was a little faster for playing games and also for using with Plex. Plex works so much better on this generation than the first. More of the videos that I have can be played direct instead of being transcoded. Games also seem much smoother on this device than the first generation but it is hard to tell due to the limited types of games on the Amazon App store. If you are looking for a device that can stream Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime Video, and ESPN and still be used for casual gaming then this is the device for you."
1,"Amazon TV Box has the best bang for the buck. No other devices can match performance and price this offers. Great for gaming, movies, shows"
1,We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
1,Love the compact size and ability to read it anywhere.
1,"My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN!"
1,"Better capacity, faster processor overall worth the extra money."
1,"I've had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick."
1,works as advertised. small and light. will along with my kindle fire.
1,"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
1,I needed a tablet...and it came in handy...just what I needed.
1,This was bought for toys for tots. Everyone always buys for the younger kids but forget that here are pre-teens and teenagers too!
1,This is the perfect gift for Grandkids especially to get them interested in reading.
1,I bought this gift on black Friday as gift for my tech challenged mom. She really likes it it's easy to use and looks really good.
1,Perfect for us. We stream a lot and this does the job with minimal interruptions
1,the best streaming player ever and super fast for you tube and netflix
0,"I had the first generation fire tv and I really don't see any reason to upgrade. Sure it has 4k support but only for Amazon movies, not Netflix. I returned this device."
1,Good quality tablet that handles all your needs from young to old
1,"I love this tablet! Perfect size, great graphics and speed. Purchased this on sale during the holidays - great value!"
1,"Great tablet, not for the power user. Average users will find everything they need."
1,This was a gift for a mother. The mother loved the gift
1,"Amazon Echo is easy to use and provides a fun aspect to its application. Am looking forward to expanding to its use with home smart devices. Only downside is with a grandchild named Alexis, not being able to rename is a bit problematic."
1,Great device when working correctly. Every once and a while it gets slow with connectivity and the remote has its days that it doesn't work.
1,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
1,Wish we could get some free stuff with it. Might have to get amazon prime to get more stuff
1,Great price. Love it. Couldn't believe the price....
1,Works as advertised.
1,"We've waited for the perfect Android tablet for our twin grand daughters and we finally found it. These are great for game play, surfing, learning, and growing with them. The display is amazing. Easy personalization out of the box. And it's through the Play Store. Awesome!"
1,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
1,This is the perfect tablet for my 3 year old son. He loves it and it is easy for him to navigate. It is also easy for me to set up parental controls and give him access to certain apps.
1,A little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it it's very satisfying
1,Great device for the price. Small enough to hide it and quiet enough to forget about it. 4K is the great addition that's on it. Compared to Apple TV you get more storage space for less on this and you get 4K too.
1,Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.
0,"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!"
1,Very good produce easy to set up and did not need to read books
1,this has been a great tablet for my daughter and a great gift
1,"I so enjoy Alexa. My favorite radio station is just a request away, as is most information. Great conversation piece!"
1,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!
1,"Highly recommend. Even my 2 year old loves it, she likes hearing songs I have taught her."
0,I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)
1,It is a pretty good tablet for the price. The only thing is when I gave it to my Niece for the holidays that it had debris under the screen in which the backlight amplified their existence.
0,Too many advertisements to get through. A little tough to adjust to coming from the apple world.
1,This tablet is way more than expected! I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play minecraft on and she hasnt complained yet!
1,"There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding."
1,"I was intrigued by this device and wanted to give it a try. I also have the Bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the Bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase. For information and requesting a quick song or radio station, this thing rocks. You have to take time letting Alexa learn your voice but overall, the voice recognition is much better than Siri. My one complaint is that it doesn't sync with my Apple Calendar. Come on Amazon, cut a deal with Apple! Anyway, I give this a thumbs up and a 4 star rating. Get one. You won't have buyer's remorse."
1,Great for kids. The bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. I might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. The programs are easy to access and love the parental controls.
1,This is a great little tablet. I find it is about the same size as the IPad Mini for a fraction of the cost. Lots of free apps and really nice graphics.
1,I boufgt it as a gift to my granddaughter and she uses it for school work daily
1,I wake up every morning and get my weather and news before I go to work. Haven't really done any other things with it yet. Not sure if it's worth the price.
1,I love my Kindle Paperwhite! It's very easy to use and lightweight. The best part is that I can read it outside during the day or late at night in bed. It's easier on my eyes than reading from the Kindle ap on my phone.
1,"Got my Alexa on sale, staff was knowledgeable, very pleased"
1,My daughters 3 or 4th kindle. She loves it and is always playing on it
1,I got this item as a gift for a coworker and she really seemed to like it. The price is very fair compared to other tablets.
1,We treat echo as our own family member. Echo gets intelligent as we keep on talking to her. Sometimes we move her in the house to be with us. I was sceptical at first to buy one. Now I realize echo is imperative.
1,He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs
1,"One my favorite color ..................:.::::.::,"
1,"I love it , I use it everyday with my grandkids for homework"
1,I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
1,The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.
1,Bought it for my niece and nephews as a beginner tablet and turned out pretty well. Value buy.
1,"I use this for facebook , checking email, and streaming Pandora while in a hotel. Don't ask a lot from this because at the end of the day it's still a $50 tablet. Battery life is really good, however it's really finicky about the power cord while charging. The biggest complaint I have is it wants a credit card even for free apps such as facebook and youtube. However you can work around by getting them on your desktop and having them sent to your device. Overall extremely satisfied."
1,cord is too short
1,"I use the echo to control all my smart home appliances (lights, thermostat, remote, cameras, etc...). It is so much easier than using the apps. I have 2 as well as the Tap."
1,Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
0,"I got this for my son because it's cheap enough for me to replace if he breaks it. I really have no complaints about it, has my music and great apps for my son to use. Not to mention it's easily replaceable. For more visit www.blackliontravel.com"
1,I love this product. Easy to use. Functional. Great
1,"Bought this for my husband primarily so he could get the Wall Street Journal. It works great and he loves that it holds a charge, nice size, durable, great resolution, etc. it turned out to be a great gift!"
0,This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users
1,Purchase this tablet for my mother. Her first tablet to read books.
1,Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle
1,Great tablet all around. Good for kids for the parental control options.
1,"Trusted brand, great quality tablet. Great for what I use it: browsing, FB, some puzzle games etc"
1,Great product and for the price it's a deal you can't pass up
1,Good product. Works as intended. I like the ability for additional memory as well as 4K ability.
1,"I love this adult toy with some serious ""can do"" abilities. We have one at work, so I purchased one for home. My son loved it so much, I bought him one to take to college with him. Now we can send message to each other just by asking Alexa to send a message. It can do so much more, and very easy to set up."
1,I bought this Tablet for my 3 years old granddaughter and she really loves it. Very easy to use !
1,"Social media, ereader(kindle) wade ease of use easy setup nice parental controls good tablet for the kids"
1,"Good tablet for my daughter! She loves it ,but she gets annoyed how the battery runs out quickly!"
1,"I use I daily for news, weather and music. It's really nice to have in the house."
1,I brought this tablet as a present for my wife since her last tablet she had just died out. It seems to work well for her and she swems very happy with it.
1,Great tablet for my daughter. Does everything she needs to do with it and easy set up. She loves it. Might be the best present she got for Christmas this year.
0,Force update when turned it on for the first time. Have to wait for an hour with nothing to do on the tablet. Really bad user experience.
1,"If you're main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction."
1,The picture quality is great.It's easy to hook up.
0,Seems to be a great unit with great accessibility.
1,"I love how compact this kindle is, I'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. The screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, I just wish Best Buy offered a case for it I had to purchase one from amazon."
1,Great deal. We bought these so that our niece and nephew could watch movies. We were able to load some movies on a memory card and insert it into the fire. Works great.
1,"Very good product to have at home, comes in handy and makes life a bit easier"
1,Great tablet for a toddler to start on! The parental controls can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways!
0,"My girls were super excited to get their Fires for Christmas! Unfortunately, one of them stopped recognizing the touch screen after an hour of opening. Amazon was kind enough to send us a new one direct with a return label so returning it was simple! Crossing my fingers still though!"
1,I got my Amazon FireTV from Best Buy. At that time they were fully stocked as hoped for. The price was great. Best Buy is my store.
1,This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
1,"Great product for home improvement, and also playing music as a bluetooth speaker."
1,Perfect starter item for kids learning electronics.
0,"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
1,Bargain for the price. Long battery life. The screen quality is good. I use this tablet everyday.
1,Bought this for a child it's very durable and works very good for his games and things
1,No complaints. I use it mostly for music. If you want it for daily amazon deals you have to turn on 1 click order. Not sure if I like that feature.
1,Bought for my son since he kept stealing mine........
1,Enjoy the kindle. Just the right size and easy to handle
1,My Grandaughter loves it! Found it easy to understand and can read anywhere she likes.Great product!
1,This is a great product to have in your in house/ I bought a Belkin WeMo outlet with it and told Alexa to turn my Christmas tree on. Really cool
1,I bought this for my niece for Christmas. She is 8 she loved it.
1,Very universal in use and was of applications. Real quick in response
1,"I have several covers, from simple rubber covers to the more expanded package of hard cased plastic rubber Otterbox.I will keep it simple by summing up pro's and con's:PRO's1 Reading comfortThis one is my favorite for when it comes to reading comfort. You can fold the leather cover back to have the 'one page' feel of just the Kindle in your hand, or you can leave it open and then the Kindle reads more like an unfolded book.2 protection on the inside and good to hold for longer periods of timeThe inside is soft to protect the screen, and the outside is real leather - which is a plus to rubber which tends to make the hands more sticky after a while.3 The weight is neglegible the item is very light.4 The hinge system prevents the Kindle to slip out, which no other cover that I know of has5 Elastic band keeps the cover together and indicates 'front' of the device. Many people have complained before that when one opens the Kindle on the back unintentionally, the Kindle could crack at the hinges. By closing it up with the elastic band, you always know where the front is so you never have this problemCON's1 Expensive. That is why I bought it from overstock.com from the marketplace amazon, rather than new from amazon itself2 No total protection. Only an Otterbox case will make sure the Kindle survives a fall on the ground. But for both cases you still need a plastic screen cover to keep the Kindle clean and untouched.Overall If reading comfort is firt priority, and you are careful enough not to damage the Kindle, this is the product for you. If you rather want more safety from damage or scratches, go for the Otterbox, but then the comfortable feel will be compromised for a more heave, rubber 'touch'."
1,Bought this kindle because my library has limited supply of large print books. Now I can control font size of print. Easy on my eyes with backlit screen. Convenient to carry in my bag. Long lasting battery. Happy reader.
1,"Great Multimedia solution. I do not have a smart tv and this is a perfect solution All apps I will ever need are available, easy to install and get started and yet very easy to use. Great product."
1,This tablet is the best $50 I have ever spent. This tablet is worth so much more.
1,This is an awesome tablet for the price!! Works like the expensive ones for less!
1,"Best bang for the buck! Although it may lack the processing power of the Ipad Mini, it has all the features and is 20% of the cost at $50.00. The battery lasts at least 5 hours of intense gameplay and video watching. I bought this primarily for my wife as a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email, etc. She was not android savvy, but picked this up in a few days. I was very pleased to find it had Bluetooth! The built in speaker is what you would expect, small, mono and tinny. Although it isn't listed HD, at 7 inches an SD picture is razor sharp. Colors are bright, and the unit is light. Although you can't (without a hack- google it, wink wink) get google Play apps, the Amazon Underground has 10k FREE apps.You can also upgrade to 128 gb of external storage.Won't give it five stars as the sound without external speakers or headphones is weak, and the speaker is placed on the back, but would say 4.5 stars."
1,This is a great product if you wanna break away from the expense of high cable bills.
1,I purchased this tablet when it was on sale for black Friday. Overall it works great. Can't beat the price.
1,"Love it, love it, love it. I was able to also sync my Sirrius Satelite service to it too."
1,"I'm very pleased with my fire tv purchase. It was highly recommended and it indefinitely delivers. So many tv shows and movies are available, now to find the time to watch them all."
1,Great product! Definitely buy this brand first!!!!!
1,We LOVE Alexa. This AI is so helpful. We use this daily and look forward to the many new uses in our home.
1,Excellent except for the fact that after it automatically goes into sleep mode after thirty minutes of non-activity it is difficult to wake up.
1,Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
0,"Thought we'd have tons of fun with Alexa; found that had to stretch to use it productively. Maybe that's why Amazon puts out a steady stream of ""Here's what's new with Alexa"" emails, a lot of them revolving around buying more stuff from Amazon."
1,I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.
1,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement."
1,I bought this product for a 2 year old. It is easy enough for her to operate. She almost can operate it better than I can.
1,"I'll admit that I sometimes think of this as the computer on ""Star Trek"" but I appreciate the wit of some of the responses. Like when I asked, ""Alexa, did you miss me?"""
1,"Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
1,I am really glad i decided to purchase the firebox. Faster than the stick.
1,I find this product is far better Han Apple TV. Otis easy to use the controls are smooth and it's extremely compact.
1,"I haven't signed up for Amazon Prime yet, so haven't gotten to experience the musical aspects yet, but have with friends' Echoes and really liked theirs."
1,It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks
1,Really good for anyone all the best parts of amazon kindle fire but with new expandable storage which makes awesome plus cameras which were not available before
1,The Echo was an excellent addition to our home. We like asking Alexa things and playing music
1,This Fire TV is a great way to cut the cord on cable provider or satellite. We are able to stream everything we need and in 4k on our TV. Definitely worth the value.
1,From me to me. Love this tablet and the price was 49.99
1,"Got this as a step up from the Fire Stick, and can definitely tell the difference. No Lag! Great device. They've recently pushed an update which has cleaned up the interface for the better. We also have ROKU, which is also great."
1,This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase.
1,The product worked as expected. has a nice sleek design and does not take up much space
1,"Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."
1,This product is great for kids! Not so expensive or fragile that you have to be super careful with it but great for the basics!
1,Works great and super fast compared to my old Firestick!
1,"I thought this would have a better sound than the Google Home Assistant based on price ($50 more when not on sale) and description of speaker. Ran the two side by side and I thought the Google Home had a better sound. Neither one is a main speaker in my room but sometimes it is easier to just ask them to play a station on Pandora or Radio than going to the main sound system. As for what Alexa can and can't do...that is tough to say since we don't have any smart devices in the house at that moment. It works well for quick weather, news and traffic reports but not so good for a free-form question. Google was more intuitive and better at understanding the question. With Alexa, if you have not downloaded the ""skill"" then there is a chance that she won't understand. Still, she is very good at keeping track of shopping lists and at some point I will add smart lights, thermostats, garage door opener, etc. to the house so hopefully the convenience will make things better."
1,"this is a really nice e-book reader. Nice white screen, easy to read and operate. For the price I am not sure you can beat this."
1,My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.
1,We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
1,"Transitioning from paper to e-reader has been difficult for this book lover. I had to do it because my briefcase and arms could only carry so much. the quality and the ease of reading what you want, when you want, makes this the only book that I need."
1,My kindle battery seemed to last a really short time. I contacted Amazon support and they suggested to try this charger. It did help. Now the kindle lasts more than 2 hours.
1,Tablet was for my 9yr old. It works great. It has good parental controls. It could use a little more memory but well worth the money paid. Ship to store worked perfectly.
1,Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet.
1,"This is a wonderful device especially for the beginner, my 70 year old mother. Step-by-step setup instructions are easy to follow, and the price is phenomenal for the features it has"
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is an improvement over older generation Kindle's with it's clearer display, cleaner font, and built-in light. It's an e-reader that anyone can use with very little technical capability and makes for an enjoyable reading experience."
0,"its good product but it has a big problem , the battery is the big issue for this device."
1,"It is high recomend for everyone, it is fast and afforable player."
1,"AS LONG AS MY BABY IS HAPPY, I'M HAPPY! WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY?"
1,This tablet is a great purchase for the price. Easy to use and perfect for kids.
1,My girls love asking Alexa to play specific songs they want to listen too. They also enjoy seeing how smart she is by asking her to figure out homework questions.
1,Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly.
1,"Purchased one for our son and liked it so much that we bought one for ourselves. It is very helpful in the kitchen for conversions, timers, and music. My favorite is checking my commute before I leave in the morning. The only downside is I had to do a lot of research on the capabilities, there was no one stop shop. Learning new things and like all gadgets, it is not necessary but fun to have."
1,This is my second Kindle. I think this product is good for all ages. It's durable!
1,"I bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, I just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. Overall it's a great product for a small child"
1,"Bought this for my daughter after she broke my Gen1 Nexus 7. Great little table for doing simple things, perfect for kids."
1,"I purchased as a gift for a five year old, and he loves it. He has downloaded several educational games, and he loves it. Very easy to use, and has a great battery life. The price is great, and the tablet is great for the amount you pay."
1,"Perfect for on the go use, especially when your charging your phone. Wonderful product! Very impressed!"
1,"Its a good tablet for my 8 year old daughter. There are parental controls, and it can access the web."
1,This great product is a combination of Siri and radio. It's a hand free device where you can ask anything and play your favorite music station anywhere in the house.
1,I gave this Tablet to my nephew and he can't put it down. It is very Durable. Great Product!
1,Awesome!! Keeps my life in order and helps me with my Amazon shopping. Her jokes are a little lame but entertaining.
1,Its a quick fast little tablet. Can do a lot of stuff a normal tablet does.
1,This is a nice little tablet; It is definetly worth the price
0,"Bought this for 4 year old to watch Netflix and movies via Google Play.The entire user experience is Amazon-centric. The OS appears to be Android-based but is repackaged/rebuilt as FireOS. As a result this device does NOT have an Android OS user-interface.I was able to install the NetFlix app but I did not test it. You cannot load the Google Play app, which means that all the kid's movies (i.e. Toy Story, etc) that we intended to play are not available. For this reason alone the device is getting returned today."
0,"I bought the tablet for games and surfing the internet. This is a slow tablet, not made for gaming - graphics are commonly not supported. Super cheap tablet, you get what you pay for. Ended up returning it."
0,Works as good as it should for the price. Its a little outdated...but for streaming tv and books its ok
1,Great option for watching tv without a cable subscription.
1,"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken."
1,Great product to pull yourself away from cable. Sling app on it for your sports
1,Purchased this to use during my travels so that I'm not confined to what is available to me from others. I connect to the hot spot on my phone and I am all set!
1,This is great product for listening to Pandora and amazon music.
1,I got this for my daughter and we're both happy with the quality
1,I recently purchased 3 Echoes - for my daughters and myself then I purchased this one for my friend because she loved it so much. It is a handy resource and it's also fun! It's really a cool device.
1,"Gave it as a gift to a middle schooler. He loved it. Light, good monitor and decent speed."
1,So happy with the color choices! This will be perfect for my 10 year old and I am thrilled with thr price!
1,"Got the Amazon Echo on Sale and extremely happy with it so far! It was very easy to set up and get waking up asking it what the weather is, getting the latest news stories, or asking Alexa to play my favorite music! Highly recommend!"
1,Got it on sale.might have to get rid of my cable company.
1,"I absolutely love this tablet,with a price you cant beat!"
1,"a great price, small and light tablet to take with you anywhere"
1,Purchased as git for family member. I have owned and used mine for over a year. Fun and informative.
1,"I love this device. Small footprint, but tons of options."
1,I purchased this for my 3yr old and he loved it. No problems once so ever. For the price it was a still.
1,Good economic solution for a tablet to surf the web when neeeded.
1,"I still like holding a book and reading, but for traveling, Dr. Appointments much easier than carry a big fat paperback. Have stopped using my tablet for reading, this is easier on the eyes. Books download in a second. I always have several books ready, so as soon as I finish one book I can start a new one, hard to do with a paperback."
1,Gift for great nephew. Have 2 that are 5 and 6 y/o. Both love these tablets because each got one. Play with them as much as Mom allows.
1,This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. My first Kindle died (I believe it was old age as cause of death) and the next day I went out and purchased a replacement. So easy to set up and there were all my books. The Paperwhite is so easy on your eyes and love that you can adjust the font to any size that's comfortable. Can be used with dim lighting or no lighting at all. Great for reading in bed.
1,The things that you can do with the Amazon Echo are amazing.
1,On the recommendation of a friend I purchased this item to donate for a charity gift auction event. It was a highly sought after item.
1,"Great starter tablet for my 9 year old daughter . Its has everyhing she likes from games, music, to movies. She loves it and cant out it down . Great tablet !"
1,The Echo is very neat & fun to use. Just ask Alexa questions & she will give you the answer!
0,"Echo simply did not do anything it was advertised to do. Basic weather was sporadic and more detailed questions resulted in ""Cannot find response""."
1,My grand-daughter was able to immediately understand how to use this tablet. The operating buttons ( on and volumn) are easy to use. Great tablet
1,Replaced my wife's standard Kindle with the paper white edition. She loves the backlit screen.
1,My wife takes with her everywhere and always reads her books now with this
1,"Fast set up, 4k compatible and for more storage USB and SD card port."
1,I got this tablet for a 5 year old. It has been serving its purpose. I am please.
1,"So, the only downfall is Alexa doesn't pair with my iCal. Otherwise she's great to have."
1,"Tablet is a great size to hold and allow children to play games on (such as ABC mouse), and even got Pokemon Go to work on it after some fiddling. Only complaint is how much needs to be on the system storage, even when having a large SD card, so that limits how much you can have."
0,"The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don't handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great!"
1,"My wife had a Nook that she loved, but it broke. The least expensive ones are more than I wanted to spend and I came across the Fire. Excellent price for a Android based tablet (with the Fire OS) and reader. With a simple 'hack' you can install the Nook app so you can keep any previous Nook books as well as using the Amazon book store. She loves it! Being Prime members, she also uses it for video."
1,Great product and warranty is good. Excellent purchase.
1,Mostly use the Kindle fire to read eBooks. Works great to download and read books from the public library.
1,I expected the drag to be worse. It really isn't..
1,I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!
0,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to read and stores all of her books. My only complaint is that it feels slow and sluggish when transitioning from one screen tk the next. Even turning the page feels slow. Not sure if it has a setting to change this but its a noticeable difference between this device and the kindle fire both with out of the bix settings. My daughter doesn't mind it and prefers the screen on the paperwhite for reading. Battery life is fantastic, its so good you can go on a weekend trip and leave the charger at home."
1,Lovely upgrade for my sister from an old iPad gen.
1,"It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
1,"Think of it as a solid, but generic iPad. It's not as impressive as what Apple does, but it's respectable. Purchased for a friend and he's loving it."
1,I have the old Kindle that is similar to this but was alot more. For the price this is a steal. I will buy a couple more for gifts. The only real complaint is the speaker is a little weak so invest in headphones or a plug in speaker.
1,"Got this as a Christmas present for my exchange student.He loves it.If I was more of an android user I'd consider one myself, especially with the kindle lending library."
1,"Like the product. Video streaming looks great with no hiccups over wifi. Lots of supported apps: Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, and tons of others. And the Fire TV will support screencasting, just like Chromecast. I had a Chromecast, but didn't like the fact that I had to use my phone to navigate. And the Nexus Player doesn't support Amazon Prime. Voice control is also excellent."
1,This echo is all that I hoped it to be the music is loud and the voice recognition is great
1,I purchased the Fire Tablet with expectations of a average performing tablet at best. I was surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so. I would recommend this tablet to anyone that wants a good performing tablet without a HD screen.
1,"A very nice tablet for the price. It has everything the more expensive tablets offer. One thing is not so pleasant, the advertisement screen keeps popping up and I so far could not find a way of shutting this function down. However, overall I am satisfied."
1,This tablet is good. It has good specs but sometimes it is hard to get the USB charging cable out of the port and it should run on full android.
1,"I was hesitant at first about the touch screen, but the Paperwhite has proven the perfect upgrade to my Kindle Keyboard 3G. The screen is responsive and the resolution is crisp. Well done, Amazon."
1,It's easy to carry and super device for all books.
1,"I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. I purchased the Echo Dot for a second room!! I love to play ""old school"" music and it has found some really fantastic music. Very helpful in answering most questions. I have so much more I am planning to do once I learn more!"
1,It was purchased for me as a gift and I love it!!!
1,Great for my 65-year-old Mom. Price is very good. Worth buying!
1,"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
1,My 4 year old daughter loves it. She used the iPad a lot but dropped it and cracked the screen.
1,this product is very nice and its nice to review. Its also very nice.
1,So happy I made this purchase! Works great for our family. Super fast. No buffering.
1,"I had a Kindle. I loved it. The screen broke, I bought this as a replacement. I am impressed by the resolution and the backlight is awesome."
1,I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!
1,I wasn't sure how the tablet would work out but getting this tablet was a great idea. And the price was awesome!!
1,I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate.
1,Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
1,Love it. This tablet is great for school work and home work and also music for your car.
1,"I bought this for my 10 year old grandson who loves to read, he is very pleased with it and finds it easy to navigate and use. I would recommend it, really good price too."
1,Our 4 grand kids use these daily charge after charge sometimes .youngest is almost 3 oldest is 9 Just watch the charging cable connection easily broken if charging while using
1,"While most avid readers will say that you can't match the physical qualities of a book as part of the overall reading experience, this is pretty convenient. The soft glow of the screen doesn't assault your eyes after an extended reading session, and it fits nicely in the hands too."
1,This has been very best Android box I ever purchased. There is so much to watch and very easy to use.
1,Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music.
0,"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books."
1,It's only cost 50 dollars and it's very good for day to day usage .. the only little thing I experienced it's a bit slow sometimes..
0,"Not so great unless you want to spending alot of money on amazon for everything, unable to download any google are android apps."
1,"Great stereo and back porch lighting! We use Alexa on our back porch when in our hot tub as a stereo and to turn our hue go lighting on. We also use her for hue lighting in the bedrooms and the hue lighting strips in the kitchen! You can also learn new Alexa skills on your iPhone every day. I'm 56 and it's super easy to learn how to use Alexa, you can too. :-)"
1,Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
1,Best electronic item in house. Great purchase. Good
1,"Same features as Echo now, but easier to move around the house as needed w/you."
1,the only bad thing I could come up with would be the battery doesn't last that long. otherwise this tablet is great for the money does everything an apple does and can add to the memory witch is fantastic.
1,Super easy to set up and absolutely worth the money.
1,If you're looking to stop being ripped off by cable and satellite companies the combo of the antenna and fire tv are perfect!
1,"This is the second Kindle I've purchased, and I love my Kindle! What I don't like is that every time a device is ""upgraded,"" the upgrades are annoying. On this Kindle, the ""home"" page is changed - it lists My Reading List and My Library. So you have to press My Library to choose a new book. Then it's a list of the books. Why couldn't they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought? I have no idea what My Reading List is - it lists books I've never heard of, by authors and topics of which I have no interest. Still, I would recommend a Kindle to anyone who reads books. The screen is easy to read, you can make the fonts bigger or smaller. I don't feel the battery lasts any longer than my old one did, but it's easy to charge. It's thin and lightweight, and I pretty much carry my Kindle wherever I go. Anyone who buys a Kindle will definitely NOT be disappointed!!!"
1,"Next to the Amazon fire stick, this 4K fire TV is the best bang for your buck. I just downloaded a free app that allows me to cast whatever I have on my iPad onto my TV. If you want to save some money the FireStick is very good, just not as fast and no usb or SD slots to upgrade memory and download apps (or whatever) to."
1,"We opened the box, and started working. We added bunch of light switches and outlets, and the operation is perfect."
0,Bought unit on black friday as a gift. It's good thus far. Wish it was easier to get back to the home screen. Other than that I like the unit
1,"I absolutely love the amazon fire tv! I have a 4K ultra HD television as well as Amazon Prime and the picture quality comes in super clear. It's just amazing! I have the firestick as well but the fire tv has better picture quality, especially if you have a 4K tv!"
1,"Great little device. Very handy to have around the house. Microphone works surprisingly well. Must have Amazon Prime and obviously internet to take full advantage of product. Speaker sounds great in a small room. Louder than I thought.Only 2 cons that are annoying: 1. It should have separate volume levels for the 'Alexa' assistant and for music. When you play music at a lower volume then you can't even understand Alexa until you turn up the volume. 2. It is terrible at Google search. For some answers like ""what day is President's day?"" it works. For others, you don't get any answer."
1,The cost was great and the features are just enough for my 9 year old daughter. I'm glad I did not get the iPad. this was a great step up from the LeapPad
1,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
1,I really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded.
0,My old kindle charger works fine - that wasn't clear when I bought a new kindle white. And now you want to charge me 6.95 to send it back. Forget it!! I'll keep the extra charger
1,"Slim fit in my purse, love the page turn ""buttons"". Auto light adjusting is good!"
1,"I bought this Amazon Fire product for me to perform a basic web search, reading, and watch video online. It is a good product; however it does not have enough space to store videos."
1,"Tablet was purchased for a 10 yr old - it's great for him to play games on, listen to music and watch movies/YouTube. Very easy for him to figure out."
1,"Nice, sleek design, works well, at least so far:)!"
1,"Amazon Fire Tablet is cool. Very useful, especially for my son playing games, downloading free games and ebooks."
1,Awesome kindle fire. Great features and durability. Free shipping sealed the deal.
1,I really love the Amazon Echo. One of it's great hidden features is that it can read any of your Kindle books to you. I plan on using it with my TV once I purchase the Harmony device by Logitech.
1,I like it my wife use it everyday to does what it say
1,I got this tablet for my grand daughter and she loves it. She loves playing her princesses games on it. We even got most of her videis on it so she dont have to have internet to watch them.
1,These is so much this unit can do......I do recommend this one over the fire stick (I have both) only because of the buffering issues. Didn't really notice a difference between the wifi and Ethernet cord plugged in
1,"Purchased Amazon Ech and for a few days found myself using Alexa (virtual assistant) a lot. It was a lot of fun however, after a few weeks I rarely use it. I think because I use more apple products, Echo is not always compatible with things aroumd my house. It is nice to have when you need quick information (if your phone is not nearby). Alexa responds very quickly, soumds great, looks great, and has some fun skills. If you have products that you can use in pair with Echo to cut on appliances or lights, you will use it a lot more. Overall a good product!"
1,Great price and easy to set up. Already read 4 books on my new fire. Graphics quality is pretty good too.
0,"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
1,"I'm hooked. This Kindle makes reading a dream. I always thought I'd miss having the actual copy of the book with me, but the Kindle is so convenient and I'm reading more than I have in years."
1,We loved it so much at home that we have bought 3 miore!
1,it does as advertise. I do have to annunciate better sometimes. But she controls my lights and my thermostat and I listen to music with it.
1,best one yet for the money however when it rains iy rains
1,"little slow booting up, but its good starter tablet."
1,"Excellent for kids! Tons of fun apps, videos and books. Love that it comes with a year of Free Time."
1,this is the best house helper and entertainer. a must for everyone
1,I'm not quite sure how I ever lived without this thing. It's so convenient. Even better if you have Amazon Prime.
1,"I purchased the 6 inch Fire HD and liked it; however his tablet is a better value. It not only lets you access all of the Amazon features, but it allows you to expand the memory for greater storage. Great value for the price."
1,I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
1,Nice and easy to carry with you. The battery's life is very good and you do not need to recharge for the next 7 days
1,Got this for my daughter and she loves it. I also use it as a e-reader
1,"Great for playing music, finding out the weather forecast, etc. still learning all the options available."
1,Good for little ones who are just getting started on apps.
1,"Bought for son. Loved it. Now daughter wants one. Easy to use, and looks good in house."
1,Excellent tablet that is very durable and easy to use
1,"Bought for my two grands to play games,etc. more affordable than an iPad for each."
0,"It works well when I use it everyday. However, it does not turn on when I do not use it for a few days. I pull out its power code and then it works again. I am not sure if I better to ask to replace it."
1,Even with onky 8 gb it's pretty quick. Only issue is downloading the free webroot... its not compatible
0,I don't care for the lack of storage or the strange arrangement and naviagation through the software. Nonetheless it's nice for its price
1,So easy to use and entertaining....I love this product
1,It was a great purchase. I purchased 2 within one month.
1,"Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."
1,Very good product. So far working so good. Would recommend
1,Great graphics! Great battery. Bought for my nephew and he loved it!
1,Works great for what I need! It took a while to understand the motions but then I got it!
1,"My cousin are really happy..nice working, good looking"
1,She loves it! Uses it for everything! She gets her homework done on it as well!
0,Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
1,Happy with product especially at this price. Easy to use and small to carry with me
1,Flashed CM 12 runs great. Runs all the regular android apps and got rid of the amazon skin
1,"Great for a kids first tablet! Great for watching movies, playing games and reading books."
1,"Cheap, good always dependable tablet, now just useless words to take up minimum."
1,"Super great if you're an Amazon Prime member, and still very, very good if you're not,"
1,I didn't quite know what to expect but I'm pleased with the product.
1,"Fantastic! Our family has so much fun playing music, asking questions. So easy to use."
0,A few problems with games loading but over all good
1,This is used daily in my house. I would highly recommend this product and buy it for a gift for a friend.
1,I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .
1,I really like it it works well . It's very easy to use .
1,Very happy with this kindle. Easy to set up and use. All my books purchased previously on Amazon came right down to the device. Now I'm all set for vacation reading without a carry-on full of books.
1,Very lightweight. Lots of features. Easy to read. Good software.
0,Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!
1,My daughter loves this tablet. She doesn't let this thing down. It's really good.
1,This is my first fire and I love it! It is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!
1,"I love this Kindle 10, it is large enough to see very easily and very easy to handle when traveling. I love the size of it."
1,"Works well for me. I love the light, I think that is the best feature."
1,"this is a good product for daily use, we like it till now."
1,Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.
1,"Great product, my customer really enjoyed receiving it."
1,Alexa is fun. You can play music and ask it questions. It doesn't play all the music you want and will not answer all your questions. I have yet to connect it to any home devices but that's the next step. I see a lot of potential for this product.
1,Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
1,"This is the best reading tablet to date, crystal clear and bright"
1,The tablet is great and works perfectly for any use
1,Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
1,I chose the Paperwhite primarily because of the backlighting. I also own an original Kindle that does not have this feature. I love the new Paperwhite! I recently used it on a long trip and truly enjoyed the convenience and ease of use. I loved the fact that I did not have to turn on another light to read!
1,I love it! I'm a senior and was able to set it up and get library books without help.
0,Item was bought as a gift I haven't used the device seems my 6 year old was enjoying the games he downloaded
1,"It was a gift to my daughter & she loves it!! From Fb to reading the bible online, she does everything on it!! The only down fall is the camera isn't that great but instead she just uses her iPhone bc she has bought at all times!!"
1,The Echo is very easy to set up and super easy to use. I am amazed at the songs that I can ask Alexa to play! I am thrilled with my Echo!!
1,"I've used one before and loved the size, weight and feel."
1,"Good Product for the purchase, great for beginners."
1,"I much prefer this over ""multi-purpose"" tablets. The screen is incredibly easy on the eyes. I can read it in bright light as well as in a dark room. It's easy to hold with one hand, plus the UI is very easy to navigate. I love the ability to highlight, make notes, and look up definitions.Did I mention that the charge lasts weeks? After reading one book (about 220 pages in print), I still had plenty of charge left."
1,I bought this for my kids as a gift. They love this device and use it daily. I couldn't be happier with the purchase
0,Don't like the fact you have to have Amazon prime to use it
1,Great product!!
1,This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
1,"User friendly and features a 4GB capacity for ample storage. PagePress provides reimagined page turns, and an adaptive front light promotes visibility in dimly lit areas. So far so good!"
1,The Voyage is a great reader for those like myself who love to read books. The lines and images are crisp and clean. Its light weight even with the cover. The only thing is the origami cover was something that i would have thought of designing differently. It feels uncomfortable to hold... The device though is awesome and the page turn features are great you can use either side to turn pages. Would suggest to anyone who loves to read!!
1,Love the product. It is amazing for streaming and has wide range of applications. Great Product overall.
1,My grandson love this tablet. He always keep up with it and the color was perfect for him
1,"I don't know why it was so much more expensive than the Fire HD.... considering this only does books. But, it's exactly what I wanted. It's very nice to have the backlight for reading at night."
1,"I love it, very user friendly! Great for the kids, lots of aps, great purchase and great price!"
1,"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range"
0,"This product is great for reading you the news, a book or the weather. Alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes. If you ask Alexa a ""google"" type question such as ""What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game"", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me. It is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes. I am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement."
1,I bought this for my wife and she uses it every night before she goes to bed. She always watching Netflix or HBO go. Great investment.
1,Great price and easy to use.Wife loves it more than any other tablet.
1,I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!
1,"I asked my Alexa to put on the music, what time and date and put my shopping list. Oh and how to spell thinks."
1,"Good for what it is supposed to be- not a high-end iPad for sure, but for the price, can't beat it. Gift for my son, a low risk way to acclimate him to tablets, but not a big loss if he destroys it. Relatively speedy, good resolution, OS takes a LOT of getting used to after iOS... parental controls were a nice addition."
1,I bought this so my great granddaughters could do their ST Math at home. So far this is all they have used it for. Not being schooled in how to set up it was difficult for me. At times it does freeze and have to turn it off to get it to restart. All in all it is working for what I bought it for.
1,"Great reader. Easy to read screen in bright sunlight, easy on the eyes in darker rooms. Perfect size too. The kindle has made it possible to switch from paper books to something that's more convenient and works great."
1,Enjoying it at work on break and for listening to music
1,awesome basic gadget for its price! no need for a more expensive one when you have it all.
1,It's great for being able to easily listen to music or Howard Stern. It also has cool skills you can download to do interesting or funny things. I just wish the speaker was a little better
1,"I bought it for online streaming and its awesome, very convenient and easy to set up. Works awesome with WAN and LAN."
1,Love this much more than cable tv. Children really enjoy it too.
1,Great tablet for the cost. Camera's quality is poor but other than that its a great tablet for the money.
1,Love it! Very convenient. Simple to install. No more cable
1,I received the echo dot for Christmas and I love it! So when my nephew put the echo on his list of gifts for graduation I knew I had to get it for him. He loves it so much it makes me want to get one.
1,"I got what I paid for. At this price point, there is no arguing that this is value for money. Great for accessing amazon content though my toddler finds it great streaming videos as well."
0,"good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
1,Alexa works great no problems with it at all. Easy to integrate with
1,Love this Kindle easy to navigate and love reading outside an having the ability to see the screen without difficulty
1,Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it good learning tool along with great fun for him!
0,"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
1,"I'm very happy with my Kindle. It is very practical to carry, easy to upload books into, and I love the screen. It is very easy on the eyes."
0,"I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is."
1,My son is having a blast basic screen but very versatile
1,Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.
1,great everyday simple web surfing and apps on this tablet for the price. Good to used it on the plane and watch movies or videos. Processor not as fast as your premium ipad.
1,"I purchased two of these for a 3 and 12 year olds. They don't have much internal memory, but SD cards are cheap. The screen resolution is pretty good for the price."
1,"If you have an Amazon Echo already then you know what a great gadget it is. This is Echo in baby size and portable. The newer version can be ""woken up"" with your voice like its big sister or you can program it to only respond when you push the mike button. It had all the features of Echo and excellent sound for its size. I have it in the bedroom and use it as an alarm and music when I get dressed. All in all a great item for the price."
0,Doesn't understand anything I ask and not very good at answering questions.I am extremely disappointed.
1,"My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken."
1,Great product the entire family loves it. I would recommend buying it
1,At first she was being stubborn and wasn't giving me my answers but after reading how to ask she has been fine. will always try to get you to buy into Amazon Music and such but I just say no.
1,I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.
1,Great gift for the price. Brought for 2 year old grandson.
1,Very good treating device be able to installed third party apps
1,"Good tablet, got it on black Friday for my daughter and it was only $39. Works well, no problems. My daughter loves it!"
1,great tablet for my four years old son. he had been through three other cheap tablets. this is far better built for a toddler. especial for the price.
1,Love my tablet. It exceeds my expectations. Doesnt have Google but i make due since i primarily use it for Kindle
1,This tablet is very kid friendly. It's easy for my daughter to operate.
1,I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
1,"I travel extensively for work and recently had stopped carrying books to cut down on bulk in my carry-ons. A sale pushed me into finally buying a kindle and it has been a great purchase for me. The screen is extremely easy to read, has almost too much granularity in brightness settings, and is visible in all lighting conditions. The ability to add library e-books is also a huge convenience for being able to read new books, in addition to buying direct from Amazon."
1,its a good starter device for the kids but it has limitations for what you can download because its not an apple device.
0,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
0,"This thing is garbage! Do not buy! It is the slowest charger I've every had. It is NOT a fast charger. It is a disgrace that Amazon is offering this product as a fast charger, and discontinued the previous all black square, blocky fast charger which really was a fast charger. This thing is NOT a fast charger. Save your money. Amazon needs to seriously check their supplier, the manufacturer of this junk.Advertising this thing as a fast charger is totally deceptive."
1,Love the Echo great for all kinds of activities. I mostly use mine for the news and turning on the lights.
1,"This is a very basic tablet, but the price can't be beat. I bought mine on Black Friday. The Amazon Fire 7 only supports the Amazon App store, so you will not be able to access the typical Google Play apps normally available on other brand tablets. I normally just use this as a Kindle device."
1,"This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn���t need power, I���d live for free!"
1,"Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small."
1,does what I want for a low price. I wanted something to browse the web that was bigger than my phone.
1,"Great product. I use this for shopping list, which everyone can add something as they use the last one, as well as music."
1,The kindle HD has met nearly all my expectations. Stereo speakers would be nice. Great screen resolution.
1,I am very happy with my purchase. The echo has been used every day since it has been in my home.
1,This is a little delay in responding and you can definitely stump it. I would recommend the cheaper versions that can do the same.
1,Originally I bought the stick. I ended up giving the stick to my friend because I had bought this as a present for my brother and helped him set it up. It is extremely fast so I bought one for myself. The fire tv is fantastic for watching anything
1,"Best tablet for kids will buy again. Purchased about 5 already,good for whole family"
1,Beats having cable with a faster processor than the firestick. Nice!
1,"We bought the Echo because we listened to the music at a friends house,- We came home and ordered it that day. We think this is the best little invention so far. We love listening to our music anywhere there is an outlet and wifi. Go buy one. You won't regret it."
1,This washer and dryer is very basic but still nice with lots of options. Great for my small family. Worth the money!
1,"Purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present. Very pleased with the purchase. The kids love it. Small size, but good speakers. Perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months. Love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated."
1,"We had a Netgear streaming device for years which was adequate until the remote quit functioning. After checking it out online and visiting the store I felt comfortable purchasing this device. It was easy to setup and get online. It is amazing how much faster, better and smoother our streaming has been. The built in apps are good and there were many more (free) apps that I found and installed without a problem. Some that I installed required that I have a cable TV subscription and so I had to ""log in"" to get them functional but not a big deal. The unit itself is not cheap in appearance nor in quality. It has a nice weight to it and feels substantially durable. The remote is great and the Android App is even better. My local Best Buy store had enough in stock and no hassles. We love our Amazon Fire TV!"
1,I liked this item. You will too. Inexpensive. Purchased for son
1,"I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it."
1,"it was good, works pretty easily. the camera is good."
1,"This is a great device, with Alexa, and the battery makes it really portable. It follows me all over the house, on the deck, in the garage, etc."
1,"What good device I recommend these product,Works fine"
1,It was a good price and nice. It takes nice pictures.
1,The Fire TV was easy to set-up and we have had no problems. I do suggest unplugging when not in use as the box does heat up...just to be safe.
1,Echo is great for all ages. It is an amazing device.
0,I only but it for the price. I won't be trading it for my i pad
1,"Alexa is easy to setup, and easy to use. The speaker puts out incredible sound for a small device. I highly recommend this, it connects to smart home devices too."
1,The Amazon echo was a easy setup. The sound was great and is worth the cost.
1,I read many of the reviews about this tablet prior to purchasing it and was so glad that I did. It's a great tablet.Simple to use at a price that can't be beat. The item arrived in the promised timeframe and in good condition. Very happy with this purchase and will buy more for gift giving!
1,"There's not much to say, it's really a simple device, and that's why I got it. It's for reading on a screen that won't bother my eyes after a long period of time.There are ads, but they are all specifically for the device, and aren't intrusive. Your books are listed above the ads."
1,"Light weight, easy for him to order the books he wants, and he has read 6 books since Christmas! He loves it!"
1,My wife is always on this thing. She loves it. I have it connected with an ethernet cord and hdmi cable and use an SD card. It works really well for a decent price
1,Does all they claim. Am really enjoying my new Kindle.
1,IT IS A VERT GOOD ITEM
1,She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
1,I really use it a lot. I take it with me everywhere. It fits perfectly in my purse. Love it for games and email.
1,"Product was a Christmas gift, to replace and older Kindle Fire"
1,I received this as a Mother's Day gift from my husband and love it. I was very pleased with the sound while listening to music. All of the other features are great. I would highly recommend getting this so worth it.
1,Great product would recommend to anyone. Works great.
1,I bought for my wife who is not particularly technical. She enjoys reading eBooks now and likes the form factor and library of books available.
1,"I think this would be a great tablet for kids, I bought it for my smart Chromecast TV but it wasn't compatible but my kids love it"
1,"Great , must own it and I love it so much. Good deal."
1,"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse"
1,Tablet works well and has all the functionality needed. Great Christmas deal.
0,The best thing about the echo is the sound quality. Too many times Alexa doesn't have the answer to your question. Too many skills required to make Alexa useful. I like to use it as a radio. Will play most radio stations across the country.
1,Awesome and expandable to so many different uses. Make sure to get the accessories to really take advantage of the unit.
1,Must have
1,I needed an item that had less glare and I could read at night without backlighting
1,"I've had a number of kindles since inception and this one is fantastic. The back lighting works great and the device is responsive, light, and agile. I wish there was a way to delete ads after you've bought the device"
1,"I tried my sons and loved it, I use it for reading and relaxing"
1,I can't believe I've wasted my money on cable all these years. I'm really happy with my purchase.
0,"Ok, so, I wanted an e-reader and had thought about just buying an iPad mini. I wish I had. Don't get me wrong, this tablet does the job it's meant to do but that's about it. If you're looking for a tablet that you can play games on, browse through Facebook or instagram on, or even surf the net then you're better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an iPad as I said before. Plus, this tablet comes packed with apps that are unnecessary and just plain memory wasteful. However, if you just need it to read your books or magazines then this is the perfect little companion for you. I'm saving for an iPad."
1,It ended up being the most popular gift that she got it does a wonderful job for children
1,Even better than the Echo Dot. It has a fantastic speaker!
0,Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
1,"I had some trouble after purchasing this, had to reboot it a lot, but since the last update it has been working great."
1,Been lots of fun and for a Star Trek Fan to be able too say Hello Computer and just go from there is making my day. We have two of them now so have one on each side of the house.
1,"Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.."
1,"Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience."
1,"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch."
1,Nice product. Works well.
1,"I enjoyed reading on my old Kindle for many years, however I cracked the screen. I didn't want a tablet because I like how the readers are lighter and easier to read. I read all the reviews for the Paper white. It meets all my needs and is even better than the first edition Kindle. I love the higher resolution. It's easy on my eyes so I can read for hours. Great storage also."
0,"bought product for my 9yr old, it works fine for her,she is constantly on it and so far no compaints"
1,"No matter if full priced or on sale, this tablet is definitely worth it. Pop a microSD card in and don't look back. Paired with a Prime membership you will be able to read, shop, watch all that Amazon has to offer. I purchased a couple more as gifts after using this for a couple of weeks."
1,My son liked it very much. He's able to read a lot of books online now.
1,"Works great, easy to use. Affordable, worth the cost."
1,I got the kindle fire for my son for Christmas and is is very happy with it. No problems. Picture is great. It was a great price!
1,"Third one I've had. Love reading on it. Can read in bright sun or dark. Other 2 lasted about 3 years. Only wish they lasted longer without freezing up. Can carry many books either from public library, kindle app, bookbub, or other sources. Free books abound."
1,"With no need for a tablet here, this was perfect!!! Love that the pages softly glow."
1,"The Paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device, thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse. You can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a Paperwhite. If your device gets stolen, lost or trashed, you may lose a substantial portion (or all) of your personal library. The Paper white allows you to increase size of print Big Advantage. Use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading. It's awkward to hold, lying in bed. An attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time"
1,Love it with the remote. Smooth interface too. Huge plus if you have Amazon prime
1,"This is the second Echo I have purchased. They are amazing from ordering with Amazon, to music, not to mention the new partnership with Control 4 I can operate my entire home automation system now with the echo. This is my best buy of the year....Looking forward to the dots which can go in every room of the house. GREAT JOB!!!!!"
1,works great for my 2 year old. I don't like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidn't and strong tablet
1,Love my amazon box I'm thinking of buying another.
1,So happy I went with the Kindle Paperwhite. LOVE it!
1,"My son loves his new tablet, never puts it down. I'm going to get a 2nd one for my daughter"
1,"I am amazed with this item, all the tasks it's capable of doing. What I especially like is that I can name it (4) different ways. I'm still recovering from cancer of the tongue and have a hard time pronouncing certain words. I have a hard time with Alexa, Echo and Amazon. With the addition of COMPUTER, it works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase!!!"
1,"I love Alessa, I love to play music all day long.."
1,I love it everything is in one place. I do recommend buying this you will not be upset
1,Works like a Charm...
1,1of fav chargers
1,The price and product is perfect. Great for travel. Light weight and easy to use.
1,I have a fire stick but wish I would've know about the fire tv. Hands down 100 time better. If you have the extra cash well worth it!
1,"Amazon Fire TV is the perfect streaming box if you are getting rid of cable. Plenty of apps, good quality video and easy to use."
1,"I JUST luv my Fire HD Tablet,love playing my games on it,so easy to carry around"
1,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.
1,Love my Kindle fire so easy to use and amazon customer service is amazing
1,I did not receive any instructions on how to begin using my Kindle Fire. I started using it before I came across an important note that I should charge it before using it. I plan on utilizing the Geek Squad to get me started. I have tried on my own but get frustrated when I can't get what I'm looking for in order to operate it. I feel confident that once I learn to use it I will be satisfied with my purchase.
1,Excellent speakers for home theater system satisfied
0,I was not satisfied with my purchase but for the price I guess it's ok
1,Got for a gift for inlaws and they were able to figure it out pretty quickly
1,This kindle is totally worth buying. Does not have all the fancy bells and whistles that will almost never be used but has exactly what you need to just enjoy a good read.
1,"Alexa is fun, a bit biased to amazon product. Example: when I scream at her to play a song she will play it from amazon music and not my Spotify unless I instruct her to. Which isn't terrible, but just a heads up. She is way quicker than your phone for finding answers to things, but the algorithm to get exactly what you're looking for is still being worked on. So don't expect her to always find the right answer. She's still a great product and fun."
1,THESE WERE BOUGHT FOR YOUNG BOYS. SO FAR NO PROBLEMS. VERY DURABLE. VERY CAPABLE.
1,I love this tablet for alot of reasons..Expandable memory slot of up to 128 mb SD card for music in the car an anywhere..Netflix for every1 in the family.Perfect for the 3 year olds phonics an movie time..
1,"I love this item. I have spent many hours of enjoyment with this item. I have bought 3, one for each spare bedroom in my house that doesn't have cable it allows my company to view TV without having to pay for cable boxes when no one is utilizing the bedrooms year round."
0,Good streaming box for 4K with Netflix and Amazon prime. Has issue with sound not balanced or randomly lowering or going really loud.
1,"It is cool and works well, however I find it sort of stupid that you have to activate each specific skill that you want to use before it will register what your asking."
1,"Bought it for my mother-in-law and now she won't put it down. She Skypes with my daughter all the time and they have great times talking together, awesome product!"
1,This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.
1,This kindle was a great price. It is easy to work and great for kids.
1,Learning to use Alexa has been an enlightening experience
1,"Useful, fun and informative. Answers most questions quickly and the music/speaker is great. Caution: Alexa has really good hearing!"
1,Only thing it doesn't have is a place to put Sim card for WiFi.went to us cellular for WiFi but they cont because this item has no were to put a Sim card
1,I bought this tablet for my 8 year old son and he loves it. You can't beat $50 for this tablet. Not the most powerful or the best screen but compared to anything in this price range it's great.
1,"Used it for learning apps for my 3 yo other than the fact that she put it in the dryer (while I was throwing clothes in there) and completely broke it, it works wonders. It's the 2nd one I've bought."
0,"Nothing really spectacular about this, weird interface. It is okay."
0,It is good device with respect to Technology and automating house hold electronics.. But Personally I like Google Home more than Amazone Echo.
0,Received Echo as a Bday present. Returned and purchase the Dot.Saved about $150. Love the Dot.
1,"Love my Kindle, easy to use and works great! Would recommend."
1,Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
1,"Bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. Love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well"
1,I bought this for a needy child for Christmas. I love mine so I'm sure they enjoyed it.
1,My 2 girls ages 2 and 5 absolutely love these tablets.
1,It works well in our house. Can hear my voice from pretty far away. Does what you want and more
1,I gave this to my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a portable speaker. I thought the addition of Alexa would be fun. She loves it. She said the sound is really great.
1,This is a convenient tablet to keep in your purse and use for reading. I would definitely recommend this tablet.
1,Fire Tv is easy to use and navigate. We use it almost everyday.
1,great for kids of all ages..........................
1,The Echo is a machine that does what it says. The Speaker is similar to my $250 bluetooth speaker. The commands are easy and I find myself using Alexa many times a day. Much better responsiveness than Siri on my phone.
1,"My phone (Note 5) is just a little small to hold and to read books on. This Kindle is much better. Lightweight, easy to read, great battery life. It's right on the edge of being a little big, but that's probably because of what I've been used to."
1,I enjoy this tablet is very easy to use. The only issue that I do have about this tablet is it does not come pre-loaded with Google. I just had to go to YouTube to find a video on how to install Google onto this device.
1,Great tablet for reading. bought it as a gift for a middle schooler to enhance reading skills. They love it.
1,Tablet does great for its price segment. Very resourcelful and fun for kids.
1,I purchased this for a 5 year old so they'd leave my iPad alone. So happy I did. Easy to use and live that you cad increase memory to
1,"I have compared the kindle fire 7.0 to the Samsung galaxy tab a 7.0. The kindle has a longer lasting battery and it has a fire os. It offers a wide range of amazon features such as free e-books, movies, and games that are only offered with the kindle fire."
1,It's really cool. Who knew I would get such a cool thing in just 35 bucks? Impressive.
1,I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL
0,It is great for a bigger picture but runs really slow.
1,Using the tablet on a daily basisEasy to use especially for reading msgs and news items.
0,"This edition does not have backlighting which is a big deal!!! If you like reading in bed or indoors without needing to use external lighting, you should not get this version! Get one of the newer editions! If you only read in well lit areas, then go for this one! Kindle is fantastic and I love my white lightweight long lasting kindle with the option to use background light."
1,"Great quality for the price. Great for kids as it's not a huge loss if it breaks, though I still recommend getting a protective cover for it."
1,"Excellent sound quality and voice response from the Echo. Only limitations are the sources from which it is capable of drawing news, music, podcasts."
1,Reading on the voyage is such a pleasure. Its so much more convenient than carrying around an actual book. I love that I can read in bed without disturbing my partner. The backlight makes reading a pleasure whether in the dark or outside in the sun. Truly well worth the price if you are a serious reader. I love having several books available so I never run out of reading material while at the doctors or on a plane......
1,Very handy
1,The KINDLE VOYAGE is a wonderful product and I use it everyday for my reading. I take it to lunch and dinner each day.
1,Both my daughters have had kindle for several years and love it. Purchased their brother one
1,The Echo has a great speaker compared to the Amazon Dot. I would definitely recommend everyone to buy one.
1,"Fire tv box is awesome I use it everyday love streaming 4k content. Super smooth streaming, especially comes with Alexa. It's a must have never need a cable box or dvr again. Add an sd card and plenty of room for games all your apps."
1,Alexa has become an addition to our family. There isn't one day that we don't ask Alexa to help us out. It's not an intimidating tool. Very user friendly.
1,I love it. Great product.My son loves it. It is great for kids and adults.
1,The product I got was the amazon fire box to go in my spare bedroom for guest instead of basic tv and defusing to pay cable service for an extra box.
1,The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
1,"A gift for my teenage son, who never puts it down. Best gift he ever received."
1,Love everything about it. It is a handy device and is a great speaker.
1,"Bought 2 of these on sale for my grandkids. They love them & they seem to work good. One tablet goes to school the other, if it lasts until next school year, will be going to school also. Good tablet for the money."
1,"Small lightweight reader, the paper white really does work, in any conditions"
1,"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading"
1,Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend
1,Easy to use. Good first tablet. Would highly recommend.
1,Great price for tablet. Son loves it. Easy to use.
1,Very nice streaming device. Very smooth and super fast. Very minimal glitches.
1,This is for my 5 year old and she hasn't put it down since Christmas. She uses it for watching videos and taking pictures of her toys..
1,"I haven't paid much attention to the Fire since the very first one out years back. But recently I purchased an Amazon Echo which I am thoroughly enjoying. And I discovered that my Echo was capable of 'voice casting.' This basically means that whatever Alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen (recipe or weather map, for example) and you can then print it out! So I wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an Amazon Fire. What a deal! $50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. I even get free movies! So I purchased a case for the Fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever I want to I can voice cast from my Amazon Echo! Playing a music album? I can see the album cover and list of songs on my Fire. Checking what's playing at which movie theater when? I can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote. And we haven't even talked about using the Fire as an easy go-to for email or games!"
1,"What I love the most is that I can set the specific time to limit for my little boy to use it, with Kindle Free Time. For example I set up only on weekdays to be used two hours, and 6 hours on weekends. This is really good!"
1,The firestorm I purchased is absoutley amazing I love it
1,Easy to operate for any age. I was amazed that even the four year old handled it like a pro.
1,"this device is awesome, I use it everyday, ask it anything"
1,"Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don't like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory."
1,My tablet works very well purchased.one for a friend she brought a sd card for more storage space having problems with it tells her not enough storage space
1,Bought this so my wife could listen to music without dragging a cell phone around. She was sceptical for a couple minutes until it was set up. Now she just loves her new Echo and uses it for all kinds of tasks.
1,For the longest time I had been using a Kindle Keyboard which was good for its time until the 3rd gen. Paperwhite came along. The decision was a no brainer especially with the 300 dpi lighted screen and at the same reasonable price. I've gotten used to using the touch screen compared to the physical turn page buttons although every now and then the screen should be wiped to remove oils from our skin that accumulate. There is always something for everyone in the Kindle store
1,for 50 this one of the better tablets you can get as its fairly fast and has a solid display.
1,Great product that has lots to offer and is constantly learning. Love saying good morning and hearing the joke of the day.
1,Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa
1,I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.
1,Not an iPad but an excellent value. Satisfied with purchase.
1,Bought this for my father as he is in his 60s and never had a tablet before. He loves it and it works for all his needs.
0,"Purchased for my son's kindle fire , plug in , and get a message that charging will be slow. I bought an OEM fast charger for this exact reason , to be fast , not even slower that a 3rd party."
1,Easy to use! Excellent content! Set-up is simple! Give as gifts.
1,"Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
1,"These boxes are great, reliable and you can download what ever you want or need for your viewing pleasure."
1,"We are throughly enjoying our Amazon TV. We first bought the Amazon Stick, but realized we need more space and put the TV in our bonus room. Both have allied us to reduce our cable bill. :)"
1,Wife and son love the speaker vary user friendly. Lots of apps for it.
1,I'm still learning about this product..so far it has been very useful to me.
1,"It's fun, my girls love it. Great for small gathering."
1,i didn't knew about the product before i went to the best buy. Say the tablet with decent price and bought it so that i can give it as a gift. it works well.
1,Read more
0,"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library."
1,"The Kindle Voyage is the best e-reader experience available. Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. So five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price."
1,Great tablet for kids. Good for Netflix and YouTube.
1,My twins love their tablets and I am able to down load lots of educational apps for them.
1,My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast.
1,"Our daughter had asked for The Paperwhite for Christmas, and she was delighted when she opened it. She used it for hours every day, so we view this as a really proper gift."
1,For the price is great for kids. I like that memory expansion can go up to 128gb
1,I got this for my niece for Christmas she is going to live it
1,This is a great tablet for its price point. The Apps are easy to use and the durability of the tablet is great.
1,Bought this for my husband. He's been asking for for almost a year. Well it's a great device informative and fun and the music channels are phenomenal. I would highly recommend it.
1,"So Alexa is pretty awesome. I have Sirius XM and can stream Howard Stern while working at home. She can set my Sensi thermostat, tell me the weather, news and much more that is updated daily.Will enjoy the features for a long time."
1,I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
1,"If you like to read books, I totally recommend this product. I love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. I used to read books on the iPad all the time but it would strain my eyes. After reading all the reviews I decided it was finally time to get a ereader. Since I had my iPad already I just needed one to strictly read books, so I got the paperwhite. It is so nice to read from especially in the sun. It's almost like reading from the actual book. It's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go. There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad. At times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. The other con is that it's only black and white. It really isn't a problem when I'm reading, just for the children's books."
1,We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
1,I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
0,"I think this tablet is better for simple usage. Not so much for a whole lot of apps and games, as the memory is used up SUPER FAST for only being 8GB (when in reality you don't get the full 8GB to begin with). I got this for my 7yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there isn't enough memory for it to fully function. You pretty much HAVE to get a memory card for it with atleast 16GB or more. But for a starter and for basic stuff...checking social media etc it's fine. And for a starter tablet for kids."
1,The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
1,"I wanted a tablet quickly on limited funds.I not only got one but I got a very good one and with the addition of more storage space, it was justwhat I needed."
1,"The Paperwhite is very convenient to use outside and inside, small enough to carry and great battery life."
1,"I use this for PS Vue and works great. Knocking a star due to ethernet issues, and for some reason ESPN app keeps dropping the connection."
1,this box does all it was said to do and more. It is a lot faster than the firetv stick I use when traveling. the 4K content looks great.
1,I love it!!! Bought my daughter one for college and she swears by hers.
1,"Has great sound, clarity,alexia has great responses"
1,"After reading scores of reviews on multiple types of units, this Amazon Fire TV was the choice for me. VERY happy with my purchase!"
1,I was attracted by the price of the base Kindle but in the end opted for the Paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable. Definitely worth the extra few dollars in my opinion. My local library offers free loans of ebooks which I have been taking advantage of. There are also many free books online - samples and classics with expired copyrights. Battery life is good and the device is lightweight. Even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare. I prefer this to a physical book which I never expected.
1,The wife loves this and uses it all the time! She would definitely recommend this for any amazon user!
1,Works great. Very responsive compared to the Fire stick
1,"I use an iPad daily, but saw the Fire 7 on sale and could not pass it up. It is a very solid tablet. I use it to watch Prime videos when I travel. Should have bought the larger screen. It was will worth the buy."
1,"I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
1,Great Tablet for the price. Its very good for beginner.
0,I prefer the iPad but it's okay for the cost just to many ads tho
1,I replaced my old tablet with this one. I like this tablet because it has a back light and I can read in bed without disturbing anyone else.
1,I'mSuper happy with the echo from Amazon. It's my new best friend. :)
1,"I had one of the original Kindles for about 5 years and enjoyed it very much. After it was stolen from my office I got the Kindle Paperwhite. Other than having to get used to doing everything by touchscreen I like it even better than my old Kindle. I especially like the backlight. And, of course, having everything stored in the cloud meant I didn't lose all of my previously purchased books. I do wish it had multiple static pictures to display when turned off the way the old Kindle did.I do hope whoever stole my old Kindle enjoys their new paperweight because that is all that it is good for except for the books already on it. I had it locked down as soon as I discovered it missing."
1,A real neat gadget that really works. Great tool for the kitchen too
1,It works great. Bought for my wife for Christmas and our whole family loves it
1,its a good product from best buy. I recommend this
1,I have always enjoyed my amazon music. Now when I walk in the house from work I set the tone and Alexa plays what I ask. I am still learning all the tricks and I enjoy the emails I get on how to get the most out of her..love her!
1,"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
0,"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
1,I purchased 3 of these for our white elephant games for Christmas. I ended up actually getting one but gave it away to a cousin. He loves it and says it works like a charm. Took him getting some used to on the Android system.
1,"Bought it for my 8 year old son. Its good to get him this for a great price, and get him off my iPad...lol....."
1,This has been a wonderful addition to life. Makes many things easier in life!
1,Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
0,"Good for kids ... brightness is not so good, ....."
1,I'm pleased with the potential this product has to make my everyday life easier.
1,I got this for my daughter's for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy.
1,"Great for anyone who loves, to watch the latest movies, tv shows, and much more!!!!"
1,"I can do everything I need on this tablet while traveling - check my email, browse the internet with the silk browser app, youtube, free app games etc. Because I have an amazon prime account as well, I linked my tablet to it so I can access a huge variety of free music, tv and movies. There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones. I have no reason to want anything more expensive, such as an ipad or surface since this does all I need while away from home."
1,The price of this tablet is excellent and the specifications ar very well
1,"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker — opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured — when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy."
1,"Purchased for my 90 year old mother, She loves it ."
1,"This is the third Alexa I've purchased...one for two homes and one for work. With Amazon Prime you can listen to music by just saying ""Alexa, play '70's rock"" it also gives you weather, turns on lights with add ons and gives you anything you'd normally have to get by logging on to a computer. ""alexa, what's the score of the Denver broncos?"" it tells you.""alexa, how do you prepare chicken marsala?"" it tells you. get one!"
1,I bought this for my mom because it is easy to use and she is able to play her games and and keep in contact with her friends and family with social media
1,Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!
1,I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me
1,"Practically disposable, everything you want and need in a $40 tablet."
1,I bought this hoping to make good use of my 4K TV but realized that there is very little 4K content out there. But at least I'll be ready then.
1,This is the 5th or 6th Fire TV I have purchased. Now I have them in every room and have completely cancelled cable. Just pay $60 a month for internet now and use my Fire TV's with the Zeus TV Box program downloaded. Now I get all the movies and tv shows I want for free. And the Fire TV has super fast download speeds. Will be buying more for the family this year.
1,Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
1,"This is the perfect companion for stay at home bodies. Very informative, helpful and entertaining. The speaker is good for a stand alone unit."
1,"Very easy to set up and use. Good sound. I use this daily for music, lists and reminders."
1,I got this to use in my living as im cutting the cable cord. Works great with WIFI and i can put my tv any where!
1,"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
1,Endless ideas for uses. Especially reminders to keep me out of trouble
1,"Works as described, happy with the purchase.got another one for the room .."
1,Works as described very portable with wifi and Bluetooth
1,I prefer this than the fire stick because it doesn't freeze like the stick does.
1,"Great tablet, especially for the price. I didn't know exactly what I would use this for when first purchased, but have found many cool uses."
1,Easy to use for my mom and toddler. just like any kind of android device.
1,"Alexa is easy to setup and fun to operate, she can answer just about anything you need to know, it works best if you have Amazon Prime to stream all the free music. Be sure to find a remote, its crazy the jokes you can play on folks, and the Amazon Dot is next on my list, gonna connect it up to the surround system"
1,The tablet is a good tool to help him with reading
1,"Already own one, loved it so much, bought as a gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas on Black Friday for $35! Can't beat that!"
1,"My new Amazon Fire TV works terrific! Great for streaming TV service, PlayStation Vue."
1,I have a FireTV in every room because the processor speed is the fastest and it requires little buffering time. I highly recommend this unit.
1,Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
1,I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
1,"I use it primarily for music and also for news, weather, time and entertainment. The only negative I can say is that when I ask it to play music by a specific artist it randomly throws in Christmas music. Christmas music is great in December but it's August."
1,We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
1,Overall satisfying tablet. My wife loves it and uses it almost every day! Would recommend getting a case and screen protector.
1,"Has a great price if you don't mind all the advertising ads everywhere, limited apps offered by Amazon."
1,I bought this for my girlfriendAnd she loves it. The only thing she doesn't like is that some games on the app market that is on her phone doesn't appear on her tablet
1,My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
1,"The accuracy it has understanding the words is really good and clear. small thing I didn't like is to make her higher to max volume, you need to repeat it like 7 to 10 times; also in max volume is you must be really close to it so it could listen to you. (planning on buying the remote control soon)"
1,my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.
0,It freezes up a lot but it's great for reading. Not meant for other apps.
1,Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.
1,I like it for my kids and think it is a great tablet for adults too
0,"Great starter tablet, but let's face it... It's a Kindle at heart. Still, it's pretty awesome for a Kindle!!!"
1,My son loves his tablet it keeps him occupied and well behaved
1,Bought this instead of getting another roku ultra that was giving me problems. This has a guide that roku doesn't and it shows you have a new recording if you have it in my shows
1,Great product for any office or home a little pricey most of what it does do can be done from a smart phone
1,Fantastic deal for price. Does everything I need and then some.
1,My requirement for this tablet was reading kindle ebooks and watching Netflix. I don't play games and no need of browsing on the table too. Bought it tablet on BF for $35 and found it to be a good value for reading. The only problem I faced is a couple of updates I received lately which have slowed down the performance a bit (that's why 4 stars). Watching Netflix is also good on this tablet.Overall worth the $35 I paid for it.
1,I purchased 2 Kindles for each of my girls. I can't seem to put them down. They keep up with my Samsung 10.1 Tablet. Great Price for the Tablet.
1,Received as a Christmas present. The size is perfect. I read a lot and this is perfect for me.
1,I heart Alexa!! I use the shopping list app and use it to stream music all the time. My kids love asking it jokes and riddles. My only complaint is that I want a second one. Whenever I move it to a different room it can be a pain. It takes it a while to reconnect and it can be aggrivating. As long as I don't move it (unplug it) I'm fine!
1,My husband really wanted an Echo after using it at our son's house. I did not realize how much we would use it. I know we don't use all of the features - my favorite is the shopping list & the quick access to it on my phone. Little things help a lot.
1,I love my Kindle! It's perfect for reading my favorite books!
1,I was a little confused at first but with continued use it worked really well. I enjoy taking photos of my adventures.
1,It's a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok
1,For the price this tables does everything I need. so far.
1,"I love the kindle, it's great. I love that you don't have to carry a dictionary around, it's has one built in!"
1,"This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty."
1,"Son wanted for his birthday. It has been great for music, lists and information."
1,"This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it."
1,"I bought this while vacationing in San Diego to be shipped home for me to give as wedding gifts. The store associate at the Best But Mobile Mission Valley was particularly helpful and informative. He saved me from carrying them on flight and had them shipped to my work The new couple loved these tech gifts and emailed me about ""Alexa"" as soon as they opened it."
1,A great E-reader that doubles as a tablet. This model even has an expandabel memory slot. Great price I bought 2 for gifts
1,"It's a charger, what else can I say."
1,"Very handy gadget to have at home. Use frequently to play subtle background music, get weather forcast, or add items to a shopping list. Can order items on Amazon or put them in shopping cart. Has been a great purchase. Highly recommend. Great sound by the way."
1,"Got this for a relative, and he really likes it. It was pricey for what it is though."
1,"I picked up this tablet when it was on sale. It wasn't a tablet meant for primary use and it is not an iPad. But for the price, the tablet is very powerful. With Amazon prime I could do much more than I expected. My complaint is that the front facing camera zooms too much on your face. Also, there is only so much that a single speaker can achieve. But it is definitely worth buying as a backup tablet."
1,Easy to use. My daughter loves it! The graphics are crystal clear extremely user friendly.
1,We all know how great this is. It's only a question of where to buy it. BB has the best price!
1,Wonderful brother...................................
1,It is easy to use.. very convenient. I am glad I bought it.
1,i bought this for my friend and he loved it. He was looking forward to this a couple of years ago.
1,I love this Kindle. The backlight feature makes it very convenient.
1,This is a great tablet for the price! Will definitely buy again
1,great to use very easy to use for teens and greatprice
1,There are free an paid games get the stick w/voice
1,"There is nothing better than a Paperwhite for reading and the new one is just great - clear, clean and quick."
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it. She said the charge lasts 8 days and she is a heavy reader. The backlight is great would highly recommend this product.
1,worth the price and pretty useful around the house
1,"Got this mostly for watching Amazon content buy it works well as a game center for mobile apps too. Can't say enough good things about it--haven't got a UHDTV so can't comment on 4k.Lot of experience with Amazon products so setup and connecting were easy for me. Travels very easily -- small and lightweight. Ethernet cable works best, obviously, but I found hotel wifi pretty effective for streaming too."
1,love my alexa. had no idea how much it could do besides play music
1,I bought this when I was going on a trip and figured I needed something to read on the airplane and while sitting in the sun. I am pleased that I am able to read books but also have check email and be on internet. It is like a hand held computer and I love it. Great for when traveling and I am going to enjoy reading books and drinking my morning coffee on the deck at the lake this summer. Does everything a Kindle Fire does but costs so much less.
1,"I would have to say that I've been impressed with this entry level tablet from Amazon, I personally really enjoy my Kindle HDX (which is a much higher class of tablet then this one), but for the Kids this tablet has been perfect. Good battery life, enough performance and storage for reading and entertainment and at less than $50 it has the quality that you can't find in the knock off brands at the same price point ... and when caught on sale you can sometimes even get this little e-reader for less than $40. Well worth every penny."
1,Great beginners tablet. Love kodi on it...........
1,I got this for my 7 year old great grandson for games and education. He really enjoys it.
1,Everyone I have given this to has said they cannot live without it. I second their opinion and have gotten a second one for the kitchen. Highly recommend as it is both useful and a lot of fun.
1,I love this. So many apps and the quality is compatible with a 4k TV. The only thing is sometimes the apps freeze and restart sometimes. This doesn't happen often though.
1,I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display
1,Love it! Easy to use. So simple to order books and they are immediately downloaded.
1,"This is a good kids 1st. Tablet and for a price that wouldn't be too damaging if it happens to ""fall"" or ""malfunction."" Just be you install all the parental apps needed before you hand it over to them."
1,This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
1,Bought this tablet for my son to replace his older kindle fire. Works great!
1,"Bought the Fire for my 86 year old mother. Yes, she's 86 and still works part time at a museum. Her co-workers communicate at times with emails and she was not able to participate. The Fire was the perfect answer for an inexpensive and easy to operate device to keep her in the loop with all the upcoming events. The Fire is easy to operate and wasn't too intimidating like a laptop or desktop. Mom has caught right on and is using it daily. Great choice for a beginner. Very happy it's working for her."
1,Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
1,my 14 year old granddaughter loves her tablet. She uses it to stay connected to her friends on FB and watches movies on it!
1,"Amazon added the OpenDyslexic font, which should be applauded. Recommend to buy."
1,"Because of the reasonable cost, I was able to buy 3 of these tablets for my grandchildren for Christmas, and to date they are working just great."
1,This tablet is just the right size for my son's hands. Easy for him to use
1,This is perfect for someone who likes to read or just have another device to surf the web with quickly other than a cell phone. Great value.
1,Bought this for my wife who loves books. She was always agents ebooks but now she can't be without it.
1,This is our 2nd Amazon Echo already. We got the black in in our living room & this on outlr master's bedroom. They are amazing products!
1,This thing is awesome! I got to replace a Bose docking station I had in the garage and I couldn't be happier with it. In order to get full use of everything it can do I would recommend getting Amazon Prime.
1,Grandbaby won't put it down loves itShe's dropped it too many times & the blue cover has protected her tablet every time.
1,I am amazed how much fun and help this is. Even great as a timer.
1,"I work with technology every day, and this device wows even me. With Alexa, imagine Siri on steroids, able to control your entire music collection stored in your Amazon library as well as music from iHeartRadio, Prime Music, Nest Thermostats, etc. Ask for a joke. Get news updates. set timers and alarms. All with your voice, and with very little misunderstanding. Honestly, Siri never impressed me much, but Alexa is super fast and responsive."
1,Bought as a gift but have not had any issues with products purchased from you
1,"I just love the Echo, it's easy to use, smart, and I love listening to music."
1,I use it mostly for reading and it works well. I only wish that the camera was better but it is okay for that price.
1,"Kids love it! We are Prime members, good kid friendly case... purchased a 128gb memory card to hold all kinds of games and movies"
1,Great Price. Good alternative to downsizing cable package
1,Great and alexia can control my Philip hue lights !
1,"FOR the price it works great Battery run time could be better. Good for reading Kindle books, when my kindle white page isn't handy."
1,I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
1,"Easy to use, great for many apps. I like the fire tv version because it can accept an Ethernet cable."
0,"I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port"
1,When my kids play a game on their profile the system goes to the screensaver. My dad's doesn't do this so it may just be a software issue on mine. But altogether I do love having the Fire.
1,Great gift as it's reasonably priced. Battery life is fantastic. Put it into airplane mode and it lasts even longer. Don't forget this is the one where you have to adjust the backlight. If you want to auto adjust you need to get the Voyager. Both nice and compact. Highly recommended.
1,I got it during Black Friday so it was an excellent price. It's smaller than an iPad but still an excellent product.
1,"Way better than the fire stick, load faster and can be plugged straight to the router"
1,I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
1,"I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
1,"We recently purchased the Amazon Alexa and I love it! She can set an alarm, give sports updates, play music and my favorite tell jokes. I would definitely recommend."
1,"Delivery is super fast, and the product seems nice."
1,"Santa brought this to our daughter, she's 7 and it's perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out!"
1,"We bought this tablet for our son, is very light weight, fast and easy to use"
1,It's got a lot of speed and apps. My nephew loves his amazon tablet
1,"I love it for my kids, they r enjoying playing games and watching kids cartoon."
1,Great tablet for Kids! Less than half the price of an iPad.
1,Very easy to setup and use. Especially like having music played.
1,Bought this for 9 year old nephew. He loves the Fire!!
1,Functions as its supposed to good deal. Great item for ur tv and a great goft for my dad
1,This product is very good. There was no problems in moving all of my books from my other Kindle to this one. I like the touch active screen and the lite screen. The size makes it easier to travel.
1,"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
1,Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient.
0,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!
1,"Love kindles , perfect for games and books , the colors are great"
1,"Affordable and convenient device for watching video, reading, kid's light gaming and browsing the Web."
1,I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.
1,"Plays music, answers questions. Better than a cat."
1,"Overall I find to be better than cable. Better line-up of channels to choose from, and no outrageous bill."
1,This was a major update from a smart DVD player. Much faster and easier to use.
1,I bought this tablet for my 7-year old grandson who likes to watch YouTube videos. For the price it was the best deal I got all Christmas.
1,I bought this for my daughters Birthday she loves itNow her father has gone out and bought one
1,This was a good product for the money. Easy to set up and do things on.
1,"The echo is very easy to use and get used to. The speaker is great quality, also. I love how Alexa gives me ideas,explains how to use the echo, and the emails that I get along with it are extremely helpful."
1,"This is an excellent device, however, I did take this back and exchanged it for an 8 which I simply love."
1,I read lots and this one is the best so far!!!!!!!
1,"Great reading experience, always easy on the eyes!"
1,"Great product! Easy to use! ihave Sony Vue tv service, Netflix and Amazon prime. Using all of these with just 1 remote makes things easier."
1,Wow - now it comes with the Alexa functions - how do they fit so much into such a small device! - Awesome technology.
1,"This product is really helpful and excellent for daily use. Kids love this product also it helps lot for home automation, entertainment. It uses Bing search engine, I wish it could have google search engine. But overall satisfied with this product."
1,I checked a few alternate movie boxes and I found the Amazon fire tv to be the best suited for me
0,Good product. Good speed. But freeze many time. Recommend a power on button on remort controll
1,Great reader. Bought it for my wife and she loves it
1,I had an older Kindle that worked great but finally died. My husband had a white page and seemed to love it. After purchasing mine I understand why. I highly recommend this to anyone who reads a lot.
1,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
1,"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
1,Only $40 you can't beat it. Touch screen is a little janky but nothing a stylus cannot cure can also add media via microdisk and outfit with kodi and its a wrap
1,The Amazon free time is very kid friendly. My 2 year old uses it with ease. Tons of kid apps for all ages
1,Product is awesome. Amazing how I ask a question and in a few seconds she has the answer.
1,Product seems to do a lot of useful things. I'd be cautious about the device always listening to what is being said though. Samsung has the same issue with their smart TVs. Anything that takes audible commands is always listening to receive those commands and will pick up anything else you talk about as well.
1,"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying."
1,I bought it for my daughter and she loved it. She is happy to have it and read books on it.
1,Hassel free easy set up and use. Great price with superior performance.
1,Purchased for my 6 year old and it is very easy to use. She loves it. You can't go wrong for the money.
1,This will be our second FireTV and we love these!!
1,Found information very readable and prices compatible.
1,Great tablet and great price! My dad and my son love it!
1,My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.
1,My granddaughter loves it. She plays with all the time
1,great tablet works well was a good gift for a begiiner
0,There doesn't seem to be much for 4K programs. Hopefully more to come.
1,I needed something to download and to read books and didn't want a large bulky item. This product was perfect for that. Also easy to use for a Boomer.
1,Love the simplicity of the Paperwhite and the soft light backlight. I can read much longer with this and in many more places. It's very light and downloads are easy and fast.
1,You cant get a better device for reading ebooks than this. The battery lasts weeks and its extremely light
1,"Minimum setup required.Glossary of terms is somewhat limited.Design is attractive and fits into any dcor.Sound is good (not Bose, but acceptable)Easy to add features (calendar, To Do List, reminders, etc."
1,"I have a smart tv, but Netflix and all the other apps take too long to load.With the Fire tv they load faster and when watching series movies the chapters load automaticly as with with my smart tv I have to select every single tittle. It felt kind of a headache some times, but with the Fire tv n more and the picture look great!"
1,I currently have two fire TVs in my home. Prior to this I had an apple TV which was the one before the newest generation of 2016. It became obsolete with slow streaming speeds all the time. After purchasing the Fire TV I can honestly say its the best bargain in town. The price is just right and has not been an issue in speed or clarity for streaming all your favorite movies shows. The ease of use is also a big plus. I highly recommend if you are on the fence.
1,Exactly what I wanted. Far faster & better than a Firestick-- the Fire TV rocks.
1,Kids love it. Everything in one tablet for kids to do. Kid friendly.....
1,This little tablet is marvelous! I do not have a smart phone and this slips effortlessly in my handbag to be scanned at a store etc.. It's quick to respond and I can't say enough about it.
1,"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
1,"From my Philips Hue Lights to my keys, the list goes on. I was skeptical as my house is primarily a Apple Hub. Alexa plays well VERY WELL with others, and is extremely responsive. Don't base your opinions on voice recognition on Siri. Give Alexa a go."
1,We love it have had no issues stays charged long...
1,I bought this to replace my old roku 2 and i am completely satisfied with the purchase.
1,Perfect for a beginner. Difficult to hold up while reading in bed as the back shell is very slick. Great value though.
1,One of my many Christmas gifts and it was successful
1,overall good but voice control does not work yet. support is not easily obtained to resolve the issue - it still does not work
1,"easy to use light weight, I love the games it has."
1,"Smaller then what i expecting, alexa sounds loud and clear. Music sounds great, just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button"
1,I've bought MXIII Andriod box and Ouya but the Amazon Fire TV box is far superior than those! I love the ease of adding the KODI app. Just google how to install it on this Amazon box and it was quite simple. Even has a step by step you-tube video.
1,"The battery life isn't great and it needs more memory. But the value is pretty good, and my kids love it!"
1,"i had a black one, however, the white color is so attractive. when i got it, it is so beautiful"
1,Lots of content to access 4k quality easy setup and easy to navigate
1,Really like the echo and has great sound. Just learning Alexa is a bit different.
1,First purchase of an e reader. Kindle Paperwhite is very refined after many generations of change on Kindles. Device is responsive for loading and downloading new books. Backlight is easy to use and adjustable. Our library has over 9000 books compatible with Kindle for checkout. Get the magnetic cover (Kindle brand or OEM) as it turns the device on and off with opening.
1,Can't believe how fast this tablet is..great tablet for a small price
1,great tablet for kids with amazon bonuses. don't have to worry about what content my kid is accessing.
1,Like how I was able to buy a version with more memory. Love this works great.
1,"Highly recommended, easy to use and excellent quality"
1,"This unit is a must have in your smart home setup. I got this unit because I was very unhappy with my Google Home that I purchased prior. Alexa has a whole lot more smart home integration than Google Home and is very easy to set up it controls my lights and other devices in my smart home, and I was able to implement it with very little effort. I would definitely recommend this product it is a great sounding speaker as well for your home if you would like to connect your phone and stream things like Pandora. Also it is great to have in the kitchen it does conversions from cups to quarts Etc, you just ask it the question and it gives you the answer it's very easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.
0,I don't know why this wouldn't be included with the kindle. It's like selling an appliance without all the parts
1,I replaced my smart dvd player and this product works amazing and fast
1,Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.
1,FireTV is the best streaming device. This model have Alexa 
1,This is perfect. I wanted to cut the cord and I used the free 30 day amazon prime trial. I definitely recommend getting playstation vue!!
1,This tablet was purchased for my niece. It is at a great price point to do what we need...movies and games!
0,My son was excited to get this and it kept closing on him. Returned it but they don't have any in stock to exchange. Frustrated and my son is upset
1,Its a good product in the basic range. Not that fast to work on.
1,Alexa is always available to answer questions or play my favorite music.
1,I love my fire i have always wanted one for when I read
1,I have a desktop at home but this will let me know whats going on at all times......
1,Bought tablet for myself (50 something) Wanted something for travel and easy to store.This was perfect for my needs.Bigger than small screen phone and smaller than computer. I've had no trouble with WiFi or streaming such as hulu or netflix. As mentioned for the price you cant beat it.
1,"great product, we are loving it, highly recommended"
1,This was just the right screen size. We were price shopping and luckily found it on sale too.
1,My family and I really enjoy this product! It is extremely easy to use and can do a lot of different things. We've created reminders and Alexa will even tell you jokes! I highly recommend this product to everyone.
1,Tablet is durable and easy to work with. My son takes it every where.
0,"it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope. It's slow and browser doesn't load pages with flash or graphics good. poor camera. but it functions ok for a cheap tablet. i didn't expect a lot, but did expect better from kindle."
1,This was exactly what we needed. No if it could only make me a sandwich.
1,Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
1,love it... easy to use and efficient...appropriate for any age
1,"I would purchase these again,my grandkids love them."
1,"This replaced my dish/cable. Soooo many apps to choose from. Speaking into the remote is a HUGE plus. Ease of use is 2nd to none. I also bought a fruit TV, and this is hands down better."
1,Picture quality is very clear good size to take with me.I wished i would found a cover for this model at the store. Universal model does not work as to I have to take cover off to use camera
1,Perfect for the cord cutter. Very easy setup and user interface. Can add games and most apps for Android based.
1,The fire tv is great for those who have amazon prime and Netflix as it allows you to view thief 4K content that is included
1,"Bought these for my kids for Christmas , they have lasted through drops , kicks falls and throws . great product"
1,"This device is the coolest thing in my house. I speak, It listens. Who could ask for anything better. Joking aside it will spoil you when it comes to day to day events and searches."
1,Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.
1,this is best box I ever buy to watch movies and tv shows
1,bought this device for my living room tv set up best idea ever
1,"I have owned a 7"" Kindle Fire HD since they came out years ago. My grandkids were constantly asking to use it, so when these 7"" kindle fire's came out I decided to get them for 5 of my grandkids. They have amazing quality for the price (I have bought the junk out there for $30 - $70 and that's what they are JUNK!) and the grandkids are thrilled. I wish I had bought it for all of the kids. I have recommended this tablet to all of my friends!"
1,Broke away from cable and Direct tv and all there fees and high prices. Got the fire TV to do this.
1,This is the 3rd echo I now own along w one dot! Have one to my oldest for her dorm and she was really excited. The dot is used w my larger stereo so nonneed for the speaker and extra cost. I did however buy it on sale for $90 on Best Buy and amazon prime day. Amazing deal. Very loud speaker on the echo. Only con is it sometimes is so loud Alexa can't hear your voice to control it. Works with my nest thermostat and eventually with some colored lighting I plan to put in.
1,"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected."
1,"My girl loved it, she loves that its linked to echo"
1,"Pages look great. Adding books and documents is a snap. Reading books on this kindle is fun. Also very useful for manuals, installation guides and other technology related materials, since they tend to be very big in print."
0,"Decent tabletPerforms ok You really get what you pay forDo not expect anything special with this tablet. It works. Does what its meant to do and nothing more. Having a Prime subscription is a must but not a requirement to take full advantage of this tablet. Its pretty much an Amazon Portal for all the services they offer. Great for my son streaming his shows like Sesame Street, PBS, etc Netflix works fine as well"
1,My nephew love the Tablet I gave him for Christmas
1,Bought it as a gift for my brother. He loves it and has no complaints
1,I bought this tablet to replace another one that had died. it works of my purposes but one thing to note this is an Amazon device and does not have google play services installed. all apps come from amazon market.
1,"Got 2 of these for my two oldest daughters, 5 and 3. Perfect for them and love the features. Battery life seems pretty long. The year of freetime plus the case makes it worth it! Will be getting another for my 3rd daughter's 2nd birthday."
1,I purchased this item for a young lady who has since written to thank me and to say it is exactly what she wanted and needs. She is fully satisfied with it.
1,Bought this for my son to play his games on and it's a great player for that.
1,Absolutely love this device. Way better than kindle app on iPad or on droid phone.
1,"purchased the fire tv and love it, saves me tons of $$ on my cable bill"
1,I like Alexa a lot the speaker is amazing I use it for my home stereo. We also use it a lot in the kitchen for recipes!!!!
1,"This product is a total entertainer from being a bluetooth speaker to like a ""Siri"" where you can ask all sorts of questions. It's very informative like the weather of the day, traffic info. It can also tell jokes which my kids find hilarious. It's always updating to do more stuff, like the recent news breaks!"
1,We purchased this after wanting to get rid of satellite tv and save money. We wanted to try PlayStation vue and needed an option for another tv. This has. Even a great addition and we love it. Very good interface and we don't miss satellite at all! We have been enjoying many of the free games as well. This is a great choice.
1,I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!
1,Alexa is like a member of the family. My family uses her daily
1,"Excellent advancement in technology. Love the ease of connecting it to my sound system, lights and thermostat. Occasionally it doesn't recognize my voice command and I have to repeat myself."
1,Bought the tablet for my son and it works great love shopping at best buy for all of my electronic needs
1,This 9W PowerFast adapter amazingly fast. My daughter I use it primarily for our Fire HD 4th Gen tablets. I wish all my chargers were this fast.I'd like to use it on my Kindle Paperwhite but I need to find out if it is compatible - I don't want to ruin it. I tried using it on my 1st Gen Fire but I think I may have damaged it since it was on its last legs anyway.I checked it works on my Paperwhite.
1,"The product was easy to set up, and is easy to use. I love that it is hands free."
1,My daughter love it so much and she love caring it around with her
1,Smaller size. Easier to hold and put in my purse.love being able to read it at night and not keep others awake.
1,"Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound."
1,"The interface isn't my favorite, but the unit is fast and responsive. It makes loading my son's favorite shows easy. Picture quality is great. I have mine hard wired to the router, so I cannot comment on Wi-Fi speed."
1,This reader is perfect for my needs. It is light weight and very easy to hold. Books are easily downloaded and sync with my iPad and iPhone. I would recommend purchasing a cover.
0,"My child had one before , and loved it. So we got him another one."
1,"The Echo has wonderful option, great sound, and easy to set up."
1,This was a very good buy at a great price; the tablet works fine for the purpose in which it was purchased and I'm very happy.
1,Bought this fire for my son . There are apps dedicated for every mile stone in his life it's durable he drop it about 20 times and even in the water. I will buy again
1,"I purchased it for a gift but i have to do all the up keep and maintaining. I've been a long time prime member who has many kindle books. I see this can be good for reading out side, it's lighter than a tablet and you don't have to charge it alot, the battery lasts a long time...Setup is straight forward and doesnt take alot of instruction to use it. It displays adds while its off, but it didn't bother me at all. It took me but a few minutes to setup and learn how to use the device.If you have prime you should see all your books right away but If you don't have prime but have someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased (i can be selective after they are shared). One thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month. Recently Amazon came up with Prime Reading, so you can take out multiple books at a time but you have to do it thru the web or a tablet or phone using the kindle app, which after they are taken out the kindle will see."
1,I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
1,Bought it for a friend for Christmas. They like it and use it everyday. Definitely recommend it for others.
1,Just picked up from BB a couple of hours ago. Screen in good and tablet seems faster than previous model possibly due to more memory. Battery so far seems very good.
1,"Gave this as a gift to my husband. He likes it very much, but wishes it came with a separate manual of written instructions for using the different functions. He's not a fan of searching for instructions on a device he's not familiar with in the first place. That's frustrating."
1,Alexa is amazing. Keeps me and my kids entertained for hours everyday.
1,"Great for reading books, backlight is useful. Love being able to get library books on it. Not sure I'm a fan of the ads when the unit is asleep though.."
1,"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
1,I love this product. easy to ise snd i would recommended to anyone.
1,"Alexa is Awesome ! Great buy, great gift ! Will definitely be buying more products that link to Alexa"
1,The Kindle Fire is great for those that are looking for a tablet to use with WiFi and is even better for those that have Amazon Prime. Makes watching your favorite shows and listening to music very easy. Magazines look great as well.
1,"Great, love it lots of fun and great movies and speed."
1,The 7 inch Kindle Fire is just right for me to put in my purse to take to appointments at the Dr office or anywhere you have to wait. I have really enjoyed it and have bought 3 for relatives and friends
1,Works like other echo but provides a different look to match decor. It was great that Best Buy actually had this in stock when other stores didn't
1,It's a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level.
1,"I purchased this tablet for my young nephew to watch videos on the go. It was to replace his iPad mini. This tablet does everything that he was doing on the iPad, is easy to use, and only a fraction of the cost. The advertising on it is a bit annoying, but can not complain with the price."
1,Easy setup and installation and would recommend this product to anyone that's an Amazon Prime member.
1,"Wanted a tablet that was cheap in price but good in quality. This is it. Plays the games they enjoy, e books, you name it. Parents controls are great. You can limit the time they have on different fields. Has help my kids with time management. They know a few minutes here and there can add up quick, or let them play later."
1,awesome product. Very glad I made the small investment to get this. I don't even have to use my cable anymore because of this small device.
1,The tablet is going well for me and my son likes the app store
1,It was very easy to set up. Works with my Insteon system to turn on and off lights. Fun to use. New and weather updates. Plays your Amazon Prime music by composer and/or artist.
1,"Works great, easy to use and can easily be changed to Android."
1,oh my gosh so love this kindle - I was not going to purchase it at this time but I could not pass up the price - and the advances it has made over the previous kindles. this one has a lot more bells and whistles and is much easier to use! and the lighting is much better with this one too!! so glad I bought this kindle
1,This kindle does almost anything you need in a small hand held. Love it!
1,Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
1,"Really like my Fire 7. Specifically bought it for a vacation so I could read and check my email for my business. So far I love it. Only downside is the connection speed is somewhat slow. When connected through WiFi at home, it is slower than any Laptop. Also, if you want to play games, I highly suggest the larger version. Hoping my husband gets me a stylist for Christmas to make some of the games a little easier."
1,"I was not sure what to expect of Alexa, but after using it for some time I wonder why I have 2K of sound equipment. The sound is outstanding it is everything as advertised."
1,"This is much better product than the fire stick itself. I was able to connect it via wifi or via the Ethernet port. Fast easy and watching tv in less than 15 min out of the box! Also, you can download the remote to the fire tv for IOS. (Comes in handy when someone misplaced the remote)"
1,It is a very neat product. Can be frustrating at times when trying to control smart home devices. Have patience when learning new devices.
1,We bought this to use instead of an IPad for reading books. It's a great buy! no glare from sunlight or lightbulbs and super light and easy to carry around!
1,"battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint."
1,"Out of all thats offered out there, this is my favorite. It helps if you're a Prime member, and Kodi runs well on this device."
1,Bought as a gift and it's easy to use must have for yourself
1,This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
1,If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.
1,Set up for kids right out of the box. Can't beat Amazon's warranty either. Thanks for providing an outstanding product.
0,This thing is ok as long as you don't expect it to be or have stuff(Apps&Games) like Samsung or Apple cause it doesn't. It has its own line of ****
1,Works great. I got this because using the smart tv features on my smart tv didn't stream video very reliably. This does.
1,The Echo provides so much. Once you learn how to use it life can rum smoother. It offers so much not sure I can ever learn all it offers
1,My son is 22 months and he love it. He watches his favorite shows.
1,It is great to be able to watch movies commercial free and whenever we want.
1,"excellent product, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends."
1,"At first I was a bit skeptical about the sensitivity of the touch screen on these new kindles, but it has been great. The reading is very smooth and I am quite please with this purchase."
1,"I bought it to replace my fire stick and to get surround sound, but it didn't do that, but still decided to keep it"
1,Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.
1,I haven't figured it out yet. So far it seems ok but I haven't used all of its potential yet.
1,"The size is great for me, I can take it with me with little effort. The battery lasts a long time and the reading is clear."
1,No complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always
1,"Amazon Fire TV is a great media streaming device. I made the decision to cut the cable when Sling TV started providing the ESPN family of channels on its app. But the question was: which device to get. I was already an Amazon Prime member and had a Netflix subscription. So I needed to find a device that had those apps, plus Sling and Hulu. Amazon Fire TV and Roku 3 were the only devices to carry all the apps that I was using and wanted to use. I read many reviews and both devices seemed to be good. So I rolled the dice and got the Amazon Fire TV. It was super easy to connect to my TV and Home Network. I was up and running in under 5 minutes. Haven't missed cable tv for a single minute. I like Amazon Fire TV so much that I got a 2nd unit for another television in the house. With a good HD antenna and streaming media device, you will never miss cable! Best of all, I am now saving over $100/month."
1,This is fast and good size for the kids no fit the big ones but still a good option
1,"It's fast, beautiful and compact. A little expensive, but I liked."
1,"This is the way to go, has everything you need and more."
1,Some problems streaming Netflix but everything else works perfectly
1,It's cool but it's kind of slow. I don't feel it's worth $119. Maybe like 70
1,good product for the price and is large enough for viewing but small enough for travel
1,We decided to buy the tablet so our toddler could play educational games on hers instead of going for my iPad. I love how we can block her from going on the Internet as well as set a curfew. It's easy to use and my daughter loves it!
1,Very easy installation. Picture quality is great and no lag at all.
1,Sound quality is it's best feature. Volume can go up fairly high as well.
1,This is just perfect for my tween boy. It is easy for him to use and play games on while we are driving in the car.
1,This is my third kindle. I love the built in light. My first was bitten by my sister's dog (leather case) and my second wore out. I also like that I can use the Kindle app on any device and pick up where I left off.
1,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously."
1,Amazon Fire TV is a fantastic streaming box. Just does everything and almost no buffering. 4K is absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend Fire TV.
1,"Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone ""barrows"" a cable."
1,"Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance."
1,"I use to login to my computer and search, now I just ask Alaxa and have an answer soon than I could type"
1,Loved this as a Xmas gift !! Recommend to all!!!!!
1,I would totally recommend purchasing Amazon Fire TV! I have enjoyed the simplicity of use and the app I was wanting Plex ! Best Buy had the best price for it so I purchased it from there local store!
1,"When you compare it to the Ipad, it's a little small, but you can't beat the price for what you get. Shopping, watching TV, whatever you would do on your smartphone, but much easier to see.Love it."
1,This is thing is awesome next best thing to having cable the tv show and movie content is tremendous with the Kodi app I would highly recommend this to anyone Firestick or firetv ditch the dish and get Firetv!!!
1,Good. Needed product to hook up charger for Kindle e-reader.
1,This was a gift to my grandma and it is simple enough for her to use it and understand it!
1,"Works good, easy for my kids, but wish the regular Android apps all worked."
1,This is a great product for my home entratainment !!
1,The doctor recommended that I not use harsh light products before going to sleep. I love to read books but my current tablet was extremely bright. The Kindle Paper White Tablet doesn't have the same glare and is easy on my eyes.
1,I love my kindle. I prefer this to the fire because I only want it for books not applications and I can read this screen in the sunlight. The battery life is good and even better if I turn the WiFi off. I'm very happy with my purchase.
1,Wife and kids love this thing.plays music with great sound also you can find out about most any with going to my iPhone or iPad. Very convenient
1,Does whatever you need loud smart helpful highly recommended
1,"Linking with Phillips Hue lighting is great, but sometimes have to repeat commands. But overall fun."
1,Broughtt it for a chistmas gift. No complaints yet.
1,Works well and does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it.
1,Easy set up.Fun for kids...Wish there are more built in search engines..
1,"After a lot of internal debate, review reading and getting tired of trying to hold onto my iPad in bed, I broke down and purchased this e-reader. To which I am truly glad that I made the purchase.It is light, easy to read, has a great battery life and a does not have the distractions of a smart phone or tablet. For these reasons, I'd highly recommend adding this tech to your arsenal."
1,"I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it."
1,"I've been utilizing the Fire 7 for several tasks includeing email, Web searches, & control of my swimming pool equipment controls. Would recommend the Tablet to others."
1,"I love all of my Amazon products including my latest purchase the Amazon fire box. I have the stick o, two tv's and now the box on my new 4k tv. Along with my prime account I am in heaven..."
1,I love the backllit design! I can now read ANYWHERE!
1,The Amazon Fire TV Box is much better than the fire stick. I really enjoy the streaming speed and how fast I can navigate the menu screen. I am happy I upgraded from the Fire Stick.
1,This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!
1,Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.
1,The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family.
0,"I bought three of these as christmas gifts for my grand-sons ages 3,6,11. I didn't think about the type of playstore available for them to get games. They were disappointed as they were unable to get some of the games they were used to in the playstore unless they paid for them. One of them has to be returned as it will not hold a charge which has been frustrating for the child who is trying to play his games."
1,"Alexa works well - providing a variety or electronic systems as well as music, shopping lists, etc."
1,"It's easy to use and so much fun! I like that its small, portable and has so much I can do!"
1,Easy for kids to use. Keeps them entertained for hours. Love it!
1,"Works a lot better than my fire stick, no buffering."
1,Exactly what I needed for my hand daughter. She loves it and leaves mine alone.
1,"Bought a 2 blacks, blue & orange. These tablets are amazing & awesome price. i would like to purchase the prurple one for myself."
0,Buying this device I thought it could replace my phone which my kids love to use to watch their videos. It's great with applications but it's limited when it comes to kids video outside of Amazon's store.
1,picked this tablet up for my wife had a bad experience with other cheap tablets bought this one and have absolutely loved it best value out there
1,"This tablet was purchased for my son. It does exactly what i want it to do which is play games and surf the web, namely YouTube. Great value."
1,"I didn't really think I would enjoy it as much as I do. Absolutely perfect for our master bathroom. Constant music, weather, time, and useful info to get the day going."
1,"Simple and straightforward. No set up necessary. Reading with this Fire is a breeze. Lightweight, holds a charge well."
0,"I have always been pleased with Kindle Fire. In fact, I think I wore out my previous one. For some reason I cannot turn this one on and went to Best buy to ask someone to help me with it. But it seems you need an appointment even for this probably simple chore."
0,You get what you pay for. No complains............
1,Amazing product for home to control all of your home automation
1,Take the time to read the instructions. Works great!
1,I love this!! Wish it had more Apps. But great for the price.
1,This generation works much better than my previous Kindle Fire. I'm very happy with it.
1,Spiffy toy and ad they add more items to control it will become even better
1,"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!"
1,For the price it was well worth it. Tablet works great and definitely better than other tablets at this price. It's perfect for reading or playing games and very easy to use!
1,Alexa is a key component for easy smart home setup.
1,This is great for my mom. It is easy for her to use
1,"Still learning what to say to Alexa, but ever since we purchased the Amazon Echo, Amazon started sending me emails regularly to help us learn new phrases, which I appreciate."
1,It's a nice tablet that has lots of apps from the Amazon market and if you're an Amazon Prime member you get a lot more videos/music/etc. to enjoy as well.
1,"Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse."
1,"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. If you want to buy your kid a device, I recommend this one because it's cheap and if it breaks then it wouldn't put a big dent in your pocket to buy a new one or you won't feel bad for spending your money on it."
1,This is great fun. Finding out the local weather while you're having coffee is easy. Listening to your favorite songs and changing the volume by just a spoken word is a dream.
1,"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault."
1,"I have several Kindle versions. My daughter bought this for her birthday as she loves reading several series. She doesn't have to carry a bag full of bulky books on trips or use a light to read at night. It stores many books in a very small space and if she wants to reread a book she can simply go to her account and download it again if it's not on her Kindle. The battery lasts a long time too. She now takes it to school to read during down time. I took mine on a 2 week trip to the Galapagos. I used on in the airport, on my flights, and several times every day since there was no internet or tv on my ship. It took up very little space and weight on a restricted baggage limit and I didn't have to recharge it. Also, It's much easier to hold vs a big book."
0,"Every time I open my amazon Fire, games pop up. It is very annoying. I have no interest in games. I do not play them. I did not purchase the item for games. I purchased my Fire for reading books, but it is very difficult to get to books. I go through a number of minutes and still do not accomplish the task that I want to do. I would like to know how to take off the games so I can do what I want to do."
1,"I heard about the Kindle from a friend . So when the BB clerk told me about the Kindle Fire, I decided to buy one. I am very happy that I did. Now whenever something comes up on TV that I don't understand, my Kindle Fire finds the info very quickly."
1,The best purchase I have made in years. Wish I would have done it sooner
1,"Great product & price, especially for gift giving (especially for children)."
1,Bought this for my son to get him reading more and he loves it.
1,"Bought this for the wife because she listens to music all the time. She enjoys the hands free aspect, especially while cooking. Myself and the kids enjoy messing with it by asking various questions - Siri is more fun to argue with though. pretty easy to set up and use, great gift for those who are hard to buy for."
1,I bought for my mother it's easy-to-use. Convenient for her to search the web and play her games.
1,Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn't justify the added cost. So far I'm happy with this model.
1,Bought this after talking to a Best Buy employee & advising I had to return the Lenovo Idea Pad due to freezing up - he suggested I get the Kindle Fire - not too heavy to travel with & can do just about everything I need it to. I was so happy with it when it was on sale last week got one for my daughter & one for my boyfriend!
1,"Got this for my wife and she likes it. My boys love it even more! ""Alexa, tell me a joke..."" ""Alexa how big is the earth?""But when this is integrated with Prime, it is fantastic. From playing all Prime playlists to music in my library. She keeps tabs on our grocery lists. Tells us the traffic. Weather. Movie time listings (and where.)""Alexa, Thank you."" ""You're welcome, glad I could help."""
1,We have this in our kitchen and I love to play music on it while cooking or just hanging out
1,"It is one of the best 7"" tablet in the market, for the price"
1,The Kindle paper white is great for anyone who likes to read on the run. The clarity of the type and the lack of glare make this perfect for any reading environment.
1,Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
1,Worked as expected. Was in stock and picking was fast.
1,It bought this as a christmas gift for my friend. This is her first tablet and she loves it.
1,Don't know what I'd do without my Kindle. I sleep with it and when I wake up in the middle of the night I don't have to turn any lights on.
1,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the ‘Helpful’ button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!"
1,"Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality."
1,"This is the best tablet you can get under $50, I bought it for my daughter and she is quite happy with it. The last Kindle I bought was Kindle Fire 1st Gen Refurbished for $100 which doesn't have camera or mic. So it was definitely a good upgrade for a very low price."
1,Nice packaging. Easy setup. Great for a middle schooler.
1,"if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space"
1,I love the non glare screen on this product. Perfect for summer beach reading!
1,"Echo is a fun device. Music sounds good. You can ask basic questions. Nothing that Apple's Siri can't already answer. One big downfall is that the device is not rechargeable, so the device is NOT portable, you are tethered to the wall; that is unless you buy the Portable Battery Base for Echo which will add another 49.00 to an already 179.00 price. Other than that, it is easy to install."
0,Was a Christmas gift and I ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
1,Purchased this for my neighbor and their kids and they love it!! The kids enjoy and have endless hours of fun by simply speaking to the Alexa and they cannot believe it speaks back or answers their questions! We have enjoyed this product very much!
1,Item is good. This shipping is very fast. It's good for readers.
1,"Great product, for a very good price! Loved this tablet"
1,Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it
1,"Wanted a nice Reader, this is it for under $50!!!!"
1,Watch it over & over again!!! Blu ray is the best!
1,"Kindle paperwhite easy to use, great features, easier to read!"
1,"I bought a new mobile phone at BBY, and got a $150 gift card as part of the purchase, so bought the ECHO kind of on a whim. I am not a huge technophile, so I wasn't expecting to really love it.Setup was ridiculously easy. Connected to wifi, then connected to Amazon, Spotify, and Google Calendars accounts. Now its all voice commands for questions, music, and my girls love asking Alexa for a joke. I also connected it to my WEMO switches and it works well. I am still learning the different things I can ask her.I almost gave it four stars, because it takes a little getting used to with regards to which questions you can ask, or how to phrase a command for the best result. But in the end I decided for five stars because I am fine-tuning the app settings and preferences to make the experience better."
1,Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.
1,Very pleased with this product after downloading Kodiak and the Exodus add-ons. Since then I have added numerous add-ons just like getting apps from an app store. It's well worth the cost and I haven't even bothered to maximize the potential of this little critter yet.
1,Better than I expected in performance very reposnsive
1,"Compared to the firestick, the fire tv blows it away."
1,"Perfect size, able to slip in pocket. Nice feel battery last long, clear screen. However if you read quickly if may find yourself sometimes when scrolling to next page more slow or you may flip and skip over pages if pressed lightly."
1,Work great
1,My son uses it in his therapy to track his program. It is the perfect size.
1,"Voyager is super easy to use and see, love the translations too!"
1,I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do
1,If you want a simple tablet to watch shows and play games this is it. The constant ads from Amazon are annoying however.
1,I got this device for my younger ones and honestly they enjoying the device. I love the screen resolution I'm happy they like it . Thanks Best Buy !!
0,"I thought I would get the fire as a back up tab for my grand daughters. Well, in my opinion it's a little more confusing to navigate around than just a plain android tablet. So if, like me you are an android lurana566, this is a bit different to operate."
1,Takes a little to figure out all the things echo can do.thinking about buying one for the bedroom.
1,"Best sounding Amazon speaker hands down. The only annoyance is that it beeps after the ""Alexa"" wake word and after the command, unlike the other echos I have with no obvious way to turn this off. Other than that, sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere...."
1,I got this for my X'mas gift for myself. It is good up to now. Very easy to carry and eyes don't feel tired after reading.
1,I have this tablet and loved it so much I gave one as a gift. Battery life is long.
1,"I'm a Bose fan, and the Bluetooth/WiFi Soundtouch 20 is wonderful for classical and jazz. However, I enjoy talking to ""Alexa"" and interacting with ""her"" to get weather info and jokes. The Echo is wonderful!"
0,"It has a delayed response. i can't access my email accounts unless I give Amazon access to control everything. I can't put my apps on my opening page. Amazon uses the Washington Post, I prefer the NYT. So far not a fan."
1,Bought as a Christmas Gift. I think my grand daughter will be very please.
1,Delighted plus really well made product
1,Easy to set up and use. new skills being added all the time. we now have two echo and a dot in the house. makes playing music all over so easy and convenient.
1,"I like the Echo for the intelligence that Alexa brings. I wish it had sound quality that matched that of my Sonos or rather the Sonos had the smarts of the Echo. Either way, I don't regret buying the device."
1,"This was a gift , was able to talk to an associate and was offered the Amazon tablet at a great price. I'm so thankful for Best Buy and it's knowledgeable sales associates."
1,I have had my Echo for 4 weeks. I actually got it up and running without any help. It is just fun to have. The grand children love it too.
1,Great gift for a family member to be able to keep in touch...
0,We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
1,"I purchased this for my mom and she is totally in love with this reader. This has replaced her older Kindle from about 4-5 years ago and she appreciates the upgrade, especially the built-in backlight.Great product and a must-buy for avid book readers."
1,"For an inexpensive Black Friday special, I have to say that I am quite impressed with this tablet. Well worth the $33 price tag. The speakers leave a lot to be desired, but when used with an external speaker, it sounds great. The battery life is also impressive. I've been using it for 2 hours and the battery level is now at 54% remaining. I must admit that I was somewhat hesitant to purchase it, but I figured that for the price, I would give it a try. I am not sorry for my decision. I have another tablet that cost 5 times as much and there is no difference in the performance. Even at the everyday price of $49, this tablet is worth the money."
1,Love the personal assistant function and listening to music and audio books.
1,Improved interface and same great readability as the Paperwhite.
1,"I have had both the Kindle and the Nook ereader. They are similar in almost every way, with one big difference.Amazon has more ebooks available, and they slightly cheaper.Plus, then I bought the Kindle, it was on sale for $99, making it the same price as the Nook."
1,Great basic tablet !Lightweight and durable .Great buy!
1,"Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."
1,The light from the page does not but a strain on your eyes when reading. I like how light it is to hold.
1,I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile
0,"I was so excited to start streaming 4k with this and the disappointment was terrible. It just never seemed to hit 4k while my Smart TV has no problem with it. The only reason I bought it was because I loved the original Fire TV and loved the setup. Also, it was glitchy and laggy. I gave it 2 days and returned it."
1,I have been quite impressed with what a wonderful tool my new Kindle is for such a low price! My wife loves it!!
1,Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn't want to pay a lot of money..
1,I have had at least three Amazon Fires and have been very happy with each one.
0,"I've had amazon tablets in the past and this is the far worst I've bought. It was slow, drained the battery, kicking me out of the apps all the time."
1,Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is.
1,Bought it for my 8 yr old for Christmas and he loved it. I like that some of the apps that come with it can be deleted making more room for apps you would want to add.
0,We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.
1,I have enjoyed this product everyday since I purchased it. I would highly recommend it.
1,"It works great. I had a an Amazon Fire Stick previously. The Amazon Fire TV responds quicker and I have not had any buffering issues, thanks to a faster network interface card."
0,It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
1,"I love this tablet, and use it as an eReader mainly. I love how this is capable of reading my books to me (if they're compatible). My favorite feature for sure! Thay way I can listen while I'm cleaning the house and my kids love to listen to them too. It bluetooths to a bigger speaker without a problem. Tactically the screen is so nice, i love the feel. The Internet browser is a but clunky, so if thats your main desire.. This may not be the best. I feel it does well for my needs. I have found most apps to suit my needs on the amazon app store."
1,I love using this as a speaker for my MacBook. I keep it in my office and use it daily!
1,Great product. Love the FireTV! a must if you have Amazon Prime.
1,"Bought this to replace a nexus player and happily surprised how much smoother this box is. And Comcast allows more apps to be installed on Amazon firetv devices than androidtv devices for some reason, so definitely a plus."
1,This is my 2nd tablet purchase at Best Buy and I am very satisfied with everything
1,This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.
0,"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more"
1,This is a great product for someone looking for a basic tablet with multi-use capability and is easy to use.
1,Great device. Great for reading books. Small and compact. Lightweight. Looks great too. The light is a great feature
1,"I bought one echo. Liked it so much I bought the tap, for and another echo."
1,"If you are looking to start r add to your smart home, the echo is great!"
1,we wanted to have echo to join our Alexa experience and also to help out with our grandchildren as they love soothing music as well as enjoy talking with Alexa. Love the design and white color of the unit.
1,"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo."
1,"My daughters love to use their Fire, work well with the WiFi."
1,"When I originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the Amazon Echo. Since that time Amazon has made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the Echo by twenty bucks. I purchased my Echo via the Prime invitation for ninety-nine dollars, and at that time it came with this remote, but as stated - it's now only sold as a separate accessory and DOES NOT ship with the current Amazon Echo offered for sale on Amazon for one seventy-nine at the time of this review revision (12/6/15).-----------------------------------This is an excellent accessory for Amazon Echo owners, but please note you cannot pair more than 1 Amazon Echo remote with the Echo at one time.The remote comes with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage. (I have my Amazon Echo in my home office, and I store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit. The remote will not just magnetically attach to metal devices without the holder however.------------------------------------------------What I have found is that using the remote becomes necessary in these scenarios:1. I'm in another room and I want to direct the Amazon Echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that's playing. (Change album, forward to the next song, have the Echo start playing another Amazon playlist from Prime Music, etc...).2. I want to add something to my Shopping List or To Do list when I'm in another room. I pick up the remote and speak into it, having Alexa add those things which then become visible on my list on my smatphone using the Amazon Echo app.3. I want to know the weather before getting out of bed, but the Amazon Echo is in the other room and wouldn't be able to hear me ask.Read more"
1,I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
1,"Bought this as a gift for my Dad, he loves it! Still working on setting up a music subscription to allow more play time"
1,I took my Kindle to the beach. You can read perfectly in the sunshine. I also like reading it while laying down because the page stays upright. it doesn't go horizontal when you move it
1,"Definitely not the largest or most-powerful tablet you can find, but it made an excellent gift for my tech-fearing mom! Facebook, email, reading, web browsing and maybe some Netflix; that's the limit of what she does online and this tablet fits the bill."
1,"I love my Amazon Echo so much that I had to buy one for work too.Now all my friends want one. It entertains all ages from kids to adults. Helps with my book keeping, and keeps me up to date one the news. She has a sense of humor too! II can't wait to have Alex control my electronics."
1,"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
1,fire is slow when surfing web. i am not used to amazon app store which is way inferior to apple store
1,"So we gave it to my 1yr old for christmas, on the box it says if you break any way theyll replace, 30sec after opening he throws it down and jumps on .... works great lol loves watching spongbob on lol"
0,Ok reader battery power not what advertized. Not able to upgrade
1,"Alexa is really easy to use & very convenient! We have it in the kitchen for multiple reasons, music while cooking dinner, kids helo while doing homework etc"
1,its a good box if you dont mind the amazon restrictions
1,I bought the amazon echo for a Christmas present and they loved it.
1,"I bought this for my teenage son. He uses it occasionally...when he's not playing on his PS4. It's a handy internet accessible device, not as quick or easy as an iPad or mini iPad...but definitely a lot cheaper too! I bought my husband one a few years ago and he absolutely loves his (did have to buy a replacement once.)"
1,Fantastic Kindle. Worth it for the back light. Wife uses it everyday especially when rocking our new born in the dark
1,This fireTV is the new 4k device. It allows you to sideload apps. It also now allows the sideloaded apps to have icons appear on the app menu. Amazing product. It has twice the memory as the fire stick. And it can be hard wired to your network. The stick is wifi only.
1,love it for the kids for educational apps and for required school work and web browsing
0,"I just brought 4 and NO I has had success pairing the device. Amazon doesn't have any tech assistance and the directions are for a remote but w-o a smart TV, I don't think you can get much from the device."
1,LOVE IT!! Easy to use and can get rid of my cable bill
1,"I bought this product back in September and have loved every moment of it. Setup was easy, the Amazon store and search bar make it easy to narrow down the thousands of books available, and the battery is long-lasting so that I don't have to worry about constantly charging. In 3 months I have only had to charge it twice. Best parts are the backlit screen with easy adjustment and ample storage!"
0,"Bought the FireStick after daughter got one and loved it. Went to get a second and they were out of stock. Was told the FireTV had faster processor and could handle 4K...don't have 4K, and honestly it's not worth the extra money for the processor speed difference ...save money and buy the cheaper FireStick"
1,My niece loves this tablet! She will not put it down!
1,"Great tablet for the money and basic media. I enjoy it for reading, audible, and streaming video. Uses Amazon App Store which uses google play. Thousands of apps!"
1,"Amazon tablets are a great quality, an a good price."
1,"I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift. Product is great, does lots of cool things she is very happy..She annoys me all day long talking to it , but thatis also a bonus lol"
1,"My wife and I like to go to the beach, and lay out by the pool during the spring and summer months. She reads it in direct sunlight with no glare! She also likes to read it at night before we get to sleep. She loves it and calls it her little piece of technology heaven. The Kindle paperwhite is small, lightweight, and lights up at night allowing reading without harsh light filling the room. Water resistance and long battery life are a plus as well. Two thumbs up!"
1,"Very easy to use/navigate. User-friendly interface. Only con is that it's a bit sluggish for the avid user, which was just improved in the 3rd generation of the Fire Stick (better processor)."
1,"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
1,Is very easy to use and set up . Love it for music and shopping list .
1,I was worried at first since it was cheap but I'm loving it more and more everyday. In fact I went out and bought another for a Christmas gift for a family member. Easy gift. And you can use HBO go and Netflix. The only negative is there was no blue tooth. Just a FYI it's the 5th gen 8g amazon fire
1,This tablet worked great for keeping in touch in with my wife's mother up north. Very easy to operate.
1,It does everything that it is suppose to. It does seam to be a little slow over wifi. Does seam to buffer now and then So much faster then my Apple TV! I love it! Netflix loads instantly and very clear!
1,"Intuitive to use, I read in bed every night for a couple hours. Battery lasts about three days, my other kindle (original), lasted about 8 days. But charges quickly."
1,"Except for having to put up with ads on the screen saver, this pad is great. Easy to use, easy to add apps to as well as easy to use as a e-reader."
1,My family loves the echo! They love to be able to request songs and dance their hearts away
1,Echo is A fantastic product. Does everything it says it does and set up is a breeze.
1,Love our Alexa. Just note that you must have Amazon prime if you want to get the most out of it. can listen to music and search anything. The ability Alexa can hear is awesome.
1,Very convenient for a great low price. It does its job.
1,"The Fire TV/Stick by Amazon is an amazing product. It has totally reinvented the way you can get premium movies/tv channels, without paying premium price.... I am replacing all of my cable boxes with this product....the savings are incredible!"
1,No Problems
1,This is a great starter tablet for an 11 year old.
1,"Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics."
0,"Amazon Fire is doing its job. Kids play games, access internet. Slower onside of streaming"
1,Great item ! Bought one for my 20 yr old as a Christmas gift . Ended up going back and getting one for my 11 yr old and myself as well. I am not good with electronics & this is easy to use.
1,This is so great! Love it and looking forward to ditching my cable company!!
1,I bought this tablet for my goddaughter and it was definitely a great buy! Kid friendly and she has all the books and games she's interested in as well.
1,Text looks great on it. My only issue the the browsing ability.
1,Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well.
1,The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet is a great device for kids to play games and watch movies on line. Good parental controls.
1,Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.
1,The young girl and boy that I bought the units for in Nigeria for school use just love them the price was great and they are being put to good use.
1,"My son loves this. We've had two other tablets, both cost about the same as this. The others were pretty unusable. This table is fantastic, definitely great value for the money."
1,I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.
1,"great for kids ,my son loves it and good price for product"
1,"Bought it for 2nd twin's BD (age 14), after he requested one. He has broken a screen to a different PAD; it slipped out of the car on to the ground, when he opened the door. He said, ""I wouldn't do it--but I am sure that it wouldn't break, if I threw it down on the ground"" just as the packaging said!"
1,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I can't seem to keep her off of it now. What a great Buy.
1,I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.
1,I've cancelled my cable. Best purchase I've made in a long time. The picture quality is amazing.
1,I bought about four of these tablets as gifts for family members. This tablet does not come with a lot of features. Very affordable and Amazon builds a decent tablet.
1,"Great sound, very informative.. very capable machine"
1,I should've bought more when I had the chance. It's a compact tablet and good for the value.
1,Perfect device for kids learning how to use touch devices. Great tool for learning.
1,Bought this as a Father's day gift for my dad. He loves it and it's easy to set up and use.
1,Love all it offers. My Family and I enjoy watching movies .
1,"Great for nighttime. Easy to read at the beach, too!"
1,"I was super hesitant to get the new 7"" kindle fire because it was so cheap and I was sure it would be poor quality buy boy was I wrong! We got 3 of them (1 per kid) and they LOVE them. We put kid safety programs on them to keep them in an approved section of the games we have allowed and they work great. My husband and I steal them all of the time for Netflix and I couldn't be happier. 100% happy with the purchases. Still can't believe they were so cheap!!!"
1,"One of the first steps in to my smart home, so far i love them. Only bad is when the AWS servers go down my connected devices wont talk with alexa."
1,Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product.
1,"What I really like about the Kindle Paperwhite is being able to read in full sunlight/ambient light, and also the sole dedication to reading. I'm not tempted in the middle of a book to jump over to Twitter, Facebook, etc."
1,"This is an excellent tablet for someone who just needs something simple and doesn't want to spend a lot of money. One of my favorite features is the fact that there is a memory card slot, which means that you can have virtually endless memory. This was an important feature for me since my iPad does not allow that."
1,"I love my Echo. I am always asking Alexa new things. I also show her off to my friends and family. It's amazing what she can do. I also like the fact she can be ""updated"" with new things and I don't have to go out and purchase something to make this happen. I fun new technology with a great price point!"
1,"Does a great job charging my kindles, or anything else you charge with a USB cable."
1,Nice to have. Convenient for vacations etc. would like it more if the local library had more choices.
1,Has all of the apps you need if you're trying to eliminate cable TV. If it had a YouTube app it would be perfect.
1,This was discounted on Best Buy better than Amazon. It is a great device and even better $50 off
1,We watch channels we use to watch on cable and very satisfied with the access.
1,This product is handy and it sounds great when playing music.
1,"I have a 2nd generation Kindle and1st generation Kindle Fire. I hardly use those now. I also have an iPad mini, and an iPad Air. I like the Kindle Paperwhite because it's just for reading and so small, it hardly takes up any room in my purse. I enjoy reading novels on the Kindle PW especially with the backlight, more than I like reading on my iPad now."
1,Great Tablet. Its Easy to use and it's kid friendly.
1,I love the overall design and feel of this Kindle specifically!!
0,"Easy to read,very sensitive to touch. Still can't figure out how to get a new book onto the device. The on/off button is tiny which presents a problem as l have long nails. Too technical for a ""book"""
1,"Bought this for playing music, but am learning that it can do so many things. Love it."
1,"It is the right size to throw into a purse because it is light weighteasy set up. Enter your Wifi password and Amazon login info, then wooo!+ The display is bright (no dead pixels on mine) and responsive; touch sensitivity is very good.The Fire 7"" -good design and slim in sizeGood product with Money"
1,"Easy to setup and navigate, great product for the price!!!"
1,"I bought this as a gift for my niece, she loves it very much!"
1,On the way away from cable ! Cable has increased in price for not any thing new .
1,Love it. Exactly what I needed for home automation.
1,A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less.
1,Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend
1,my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
1,And kodi loads fine. No issues. Had to upgrade Netflix to 4k
0,It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.
1,My son loves this product and uses it all the time.
1,Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price
1,Just love the new kindle fire hd8 does all that I want and then some
1,I have found this to be a most capable tablet and would recommend it.
0,"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
1,Very easy to install. Great way to get the most benefits from amazon prime membership by watching movies and shows. So easy to use my 5 yo can use it!
0,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
1,Really great for room not close to your internet router
1,Always in use!
1,"This product is really great, not buffering when watching live streaming."
1,This Amazon Echo is great and every day I discover new things that she can do.
1,Love this tablet. I got it for my niece to watch her videos on and educational videos. She doesn't put it down. The battery life is awesome.
1,"I needed a tablet for my kids and this was only $50 plus a memory card and they had so many games we were able to take a 17 hour road trip and they were entertained the entire time. As far as Android Tablets go, this one gives the most bang for the buck that I've ever seen."
1,It's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs I like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the Internet all around is a good device
1,I like and use the integration for lights and thermostat but asking Alexa for answers to questions needs a lot of help. Sirius much better in providing accurate info.
0,"It's cheap so I didnt expect it to be amazing, nor am I disappointed, it's great for streaming video. Even better with chromecast."
1,"product is good,,no complains better than the old one"
0,Love everything about the unit except that it gets hot when used for 10 to 15 minutes. Hope it doesn't burn or explode.
1,My wife loves it and it's a lot of fun. The music is great and it's amazing how much Alexa understands.
1,This was the hit of Christmas!! Worth every penny. So much fun. So many capabilities.....too many to list.
0,Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own.
1,A well worth it purchase. No complaints. Couldn't be happier.
1,I bought this fire tv for our second tv in the house. We got one previously for the family room. I love my fire tv. It gives me so many options to watch. We cut our cable tv out February 1st and haven't missed it at all
1,It's such s great tablet and the price well you can't beat it. I love Amazon products and have not been disappointed yet!
1,"This is a great tablet, just the right size. I wish the cord was longer, but it was still really good. It stays charged for the right amount of time."
1,Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7.
1,Overall excellent. I just wish the speaker was a bit loader and richer.
1,"Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for."
0,"I bought this thinking since we'd bought several other refurbished things that worked, that it would be okay. The box never booted properly so the only thing we could stare at was the Amazon logo and the words Unknown Boot in the corner. Customer Service tried to help with the box but we couldn't get it to trouble shoot. Sending this box back."
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is a wonderful option for traveling (no weight, lots of books) and for seniors who read large print books - adjustable font size!"
1,"Liked the first one, love the good sound quality for its primary use, listening to music"
1,Love Kindle! Thanks for creating this gem! Granddaughter loves it
1,"This one was a little trouble setting up but finally I got it going. Now it's working great, but the Alexa App is acting funny tonight... This is Aug 25 2017..."
1,"Needed somthing for sister who is always on the go, easily fits in her purse and she loves it."
1,Moves a bit slow at times but overall it works good.
0,"I bought the Fire in hopes to play movies from my ultraviolet account. Only to find out that it no longer supports ultraviolet format on the Fire. So, I had to shop elsewhere to play movies for my plane trips. Don't buy if you're looking to play movies this way!"
1,This is truly a great product. I would recommend it everybody.
1,"The echo does just about anything you want. Weather, music, news even jokes."
1,"Alexa has been a nice addition to our home devices. I originally thought I would use her more for playing music, but am finding that I am using her more and more every day from checking the weather, traffic to work, changing the temp on our Nest, news, checking local hours for various stores....the list goes on and on. Very pleased with my purchase."
1,Love the small size and the auto light. Use this every day.
1,"I love its skills. Plays music, Smarthouse features, spells words, etc."
1,"I may be slow to catch on to ""streaming."" I was unaware of the depth of available media material. Things to consider are Internet download speed (30 Mbs minimum) and too many choices. It is similar to the Internet before the World Wide Web (www). Some Android apps such as Kodi with Fire TV Guru make some of the material more easily accessible. Good luck!"
1,"I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so."
1,I am more interested in a reader not a tablet the one thing I don't like about this reader is I cannot make the font when reading large enough
1,I baught the amazon echo after researching the different smart speakers out in the market. It is able to control my Sony 4k TV with just voice commands and it's great to be able to listen to pandora just by asking Alexa.
1,I enjoy listening to audible on it! Music sounds good and I like that it's so easy to set up and use.
1,"This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!"
1,like it works for what i need for my son very easy to use and
1,My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted.
1,Great Product to use with a Non-Smart TV or a Smart TV which is not compatible with Amazon Music.
1,Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.
1,"My daughter (4) she loves it. Easy to navigate, hard to break."
1,I love my Kindle its the best e-reader available its the only way to read.
1,"Fast processing , Large app store, fast charge,High quality picture. Quality of tablet housing durable. My son loves it putchased as a bday gift. At a wonderful price under $40.00 while on sale"
1,"The fiancé wanted one because she's a heavy reader and it's easy, convenient and portable. Was a only 40$, probably the best money I spent too make her happier."
1,I purchased this tablet for convenience and was surprised at how easy it is to use and how well it performs. It downloaded all my information from my paper white tablet and I was able to download e-mail and other important apps.
1,This is an awesome little tablet justright for reading and looking up images and things on the net.
1,I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.
1,I love my Echo it does so much more than I thought it did. My family loves it.
1,The fire tv has been a great upgrade over our 1st gen fire stick. Very much appreciate the 4K streaming abilities.
1,Anyone should be able to run this tablet its really easy to use and good quality for low price
1,The Echo is a very interesting item that is entertaining and fun
1,"I love this device. It is great for a device of its size,"
1,Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one
1,Works great for the price. Purchased this to access our Amazon Prime Movies
1,"excellent product able to get on the internet for movies, research, games communications, web surfing."
1,"Absolutely, love my newest gadget. Just ask & you will hear your favorite songs, artist, or genre, answers to silly or complicated questions, set alarms & reminders. Help puts a smile on my face every day."
1,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
1,"It's much lighter than my first gen version and slightly smaller. Recognizes taps much better and has a nicer keyboard. Still has a few things I don't like - kind of slow, insists on me using the Silk browser, I don't like that I can't delete certain pre-loaded apps that I will never use. There are some apps that aren't available for it, like Chromecast. For the price, it's a good little tablet for internet, reading, simple games, checking email and WatchESPN. Battery life still an issue, rarely lasts more than 5 hours with use."
1,Has everything I wanted. Fast and reliable. Works well with kodi.
1,The Amazon Fire 7 inch turned out to be a good deal. The screen resolution is better than I thought. The battery is very good.
1,This device does it all! Connect it to everything and even the kids have fun with it.
1,We use it every day family loves it. Will likely purchase some extra dots for around the house. Integration is good even with minimal home setup that we have
1,the kids really liked these for Christmas gifts. They started playing with them right away and really enjoyed them
0,It's exactly what you would expect for a tablet under $100. Very basic. Screen resolution if sub par for what's out today. Speed is questionable but works for our 2 year old.
1,The echo has been fun for the whole family. It plays music and interacts with everyone and the outcome is very entertaining
1,We ordered the FireTV because it has an ethernet connection for quicker speeds. It also is 4K ready so when we get a 4K TV its ready to stream 4K content from youtube.
1,"It has a very nice screen to read ebook, and once it is charged, it can work several days."
1,This device is good for people trying to reduce their cable bill.
1,Its a great little computer quick browsing great camera
1,I love this thing: it's the perfect addition to my IOT smart home devices!
1,This was a really good bargain for the price. It was easy to set up. This device is easy to use and has many good functions.
1,It works seamlessly. Very great for price and clean finish
1,"Got this item for my 10 yr old son , easy to navigate . ."
1,Wanted for videos. The screen clarity is great. Great product.
1,Glad I was given this as a present. I can listen to music just by asking... Love this!!!
1,"I bought this unit because I needed a portable bluetooth speaker. When it was on sale, I figured why not get Alexa with it. It works well. I plan to use it when I am overseas in my hotel. We'll see how that goes."
0,I stick with Google home for better value and sound quality
1,"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection."
1,Very easy to set up and use works great on my non smart tv
1,What can I say. We just love it. We listen to the news briefing every morning and music during the day.
1,This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it
1,I used it as a gift in an office holiday secret Santa
1,Easy set up great screen over time battery loses charge fast over all good tablet
1,I love the Fire TV Box it works flawlessly. I recommend adding the Spotify App. It makes all your sorround sound Bluetooth. Worth every penny for sure . Don't think about it just buy it .
1,The perfect tablet for a beginner. Also at the super low price its hard to find a better bargain.
1,Love the battery life & back light makes it easy to read in any setting
1,I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot.
0,Tablet was reasonably priced. Would say it's a starter tablet for kids. Kind of slow on response but the kids enjoy it.
0,I love how easy it is to use and setup the Echo you just plug it in and you are ready to go.
1,It work perfect. I like the design and love the remote control also.
1,"Last Christmas I gave my nephew a fire stick, which he loved. In the meantime, I purchased an Amazon Tap for myself. Since he likes gadgets, I knew he would want one. So I purchased it for him"
1,The Kindle Fire I purchased at Best Buy is awesome for people to read books online and search the web. It is one of a kind!
1,"When I purchased it, I was skeptical about the voice recognition. but Echo is great. This product will be a break thru for lot of other home automatons to come in the future. must try."
1,Excellent product to be able to see thousands of free movies if you are a member of Amazon Prime.
1,"I bought this item for my kid so he could do homework and investigate different things as youtube, google etc. It works perfectly , with great speed and resolution."
1,So I was given a HD for Christmas and when this went on sale in time for Father's Day I had to get it... Love that it has the expansion slot!!!
1,Nice easy to use Tablet for a good price..........
1,Great tablet. Drop it many times and its still working.
1,"First off the tablet is $50 so don't go in expecting it to be on par with the latest iPad. For the price you pay though, you get a really good tablet. Screen is a little lower than 720p, but you have access to all of the Kindle books, Amazon Prime, the new Fire OS, which looks alot better than the ""all black"" on the last few Kindle Fire's. This model is only 8gb but storage is expandable, I have a 64gb Micro SD in my tablet. Recommended."
1,"Answers just about any question, spells words, plays a boat load of songs although some songs require additional membership. Love it and would suggest to all"
1,"My other daughter has this same tablet, so I knew it would be a winner with my other child as well."
1,"The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
0,Does not load up CNN or Travel channel.I even have DirectNOW for $50 a month and 200 MB internet speed. And the new google wifi router.I give up and will just go back to regular cable and pay the extra - for less hassle. Cable/Satellite WINS.
1,"I bought These for my kids, they like playing games on it. My only complaint is they take hours to charge."
1,"This is my 1st Kindle bough for my wife, later on bought another one for myself , we both love it, most important it wont hurt our eyes and battery last for weeks without charging it."
1,Great product for beginners and senior citizens. Simple to operate.
1,"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
1,Great tablet my son loves it and everything about it. He loves playing the games and this tablet is very very fast!
1,I have a fire stick for the tv in the living room and I bought the fire box for my bedroom tv. The speed for searches are much faster. My only issue now that just started is with the internet connection it keeps dropping out. I have it hard wire. Not sure what's going on. I think the network port is on the way out.
1,"This purchase was totally worth every penny I paid for it, which wasn't even so much."
1,"Was a great deal for my daughter for Christmas, her last one broke."
1,It was one of the best purchases I have ever made!
0,It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
1,This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.
1,I enjoy listening to Alexia speak. I wish she could answer more questions.
1,Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
1,I bought this for my 5 year old grandson who lives in another state. He loves it and plays with it all the time. My son tells me the games on it are mostly educational and really seem to be helpful. Excellent little device to this time.
1,Easy to use but would like more apps to use with looking food to connect to home devises
1,"I bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas. I'm amazed with the performance of this tablet. It is fast, the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything I need. Cameras and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me. I don't take pics with my ipad and usually use headphones. Free games from Amazon underground, free Amazon cloud for three months a the peace of mind it gave me; made this purchase a great decision. It also,makes a great reader. Love this little gadget.."
1,I love all of the different apps that are available. I have a 12mpb internet speed and have not had any issues.
1,"Really like the Kindle Paperwhite. Easy to handle, easy to read, easy to access my books. Recommend."
1,"Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price"
0,"The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku."
1,Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them
1,"We have grown in our interactions and reliance on our Amazon Echo. Temperature, lighting, music and more, Alexa is awesome."
1,Everything on fire stick is awesome and I love it.
1,excellent for kids and safe cover so if dropped it survives
1,"The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors."
1,"This is a great way to take a whole bunch of books on vacation without having to pack an extra bag for them. My wife and I put some on their for us too. And the reading surface is great, even in bright light."
1,I love my Kindle!! It's great for downloading & reading books. It's especially great because I can read regardless of the lighting conditions!
1,"Fun Entertaining, good news updates. some draw backs is that it is not as smart google or Siri. Can only connect google calendar not IOS, at least I haven't found a way yet. Gives traffic reports. Plays music. Can wait to see how this. Product grows. Now I need to get some home automation going to try out other functions"
0,"I decided I wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time. I researched the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 and settled on the 7 knowing that it is a low end device. The device is slick and easy to use, and the Alexa integration is really cool. But ""It's a $50 tablet"". At times, the performance is awful slow. I suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or FB. My complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try. So get this if you want, just be patient. Remember, ""It's a $50 tablet"". If you want better performance, spend more $$."
1,Bought this for my 6yr old son for his birthday. He loves it. Easy to use and decent battery life. Love all of the children's books!
1,Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.
1,I bought this to replace a dropped and broken one. For someone just wanting to read this is easy simple and nice.
1,After using my son's echo. I just had to have one . We now purchased a Dot and a Bluetooth speaker for the wife to use in her bathroom for getting ready each morning and she also just loves it. It can do so many more things than we first thought. Great addition to our home.
1,ITS PERFECT. I LOVE MY ALEXA. DOES EVERYTHING I WANT IT TO DO
0,"When i opened this tablet there was a white line in the bottom corner of the screen. Everything worked fine but that line was bothering me. I returned it to the store and got a replacement but it had another white line. Other than that it was a good tablet, it is very affordable"
1,My daughter loves it. She can read books and watch movies.
0,"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
1,This is the second kindle fire I have bought. The first one is almost 2 years old and works perfect to date. My 4 year old daughter plays with it and has dropped it several time without damaging it and it had no case on it. For the price this is the best affordable tablet. Especially for children. Great Buy.
1,"I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone."
1,I am very pleased with the sound quality of the echo and also pleased with the responses from requests
1,I like the fact that I can sit outside on a sunny day and read.
1,"After opening several gifts on Christmas, my 8 year old grandson kept going back to this gift and playing with it. He was very pleased. He loves his Kindle Fire and plays games and does his homework with it too!"
1,Excellent product great for information and music would highly recommend this to anyone I know 5 stars all day!!!
1,"fast- jitter free, buffering a minimal amount of time with a 100/100 network"
1,I went to get the smaller echo but spoke to a salesperson and this one has a much better speaker and it was on sale.
1,My son loves this tablet. Great tablet for kids to learn and play on.
1,Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all.
1,This is my 3rd Kindle and I think its the best yet! Love the new features and will never go back to paperback books again
1,The Amazon - Echo met my expectations for this product
1,I love it!!! This is the best speaker for the average couch potato or lazy person! I can tell her to play my favorite pandora stations or set alarms without lifting a finger! I can even ask if it'll rain today so I know if I should bring an umbrella! Great buy!!!
1,"I bought this tablet for my wife. The tablet is easy to setup, not very bulky. This is a tablet for casual use and not for any serious use. Simple interface and easy to use, great product as the first tablet."
1,"Overall great Bluetooth speaker and for general reference-but you'll get a lot of ""I don't know"" on questions not already in her skills"
0,The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering.
1,Great tablet for the price. Easy for kids to use & great parental controls. Good educational apps & books for students. Worth the purchase.
1,Way faster than the fire stick better over all connection
1,"Great for music ,movies and games a lot of space 7 inches"
1,This is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning games as well. Glad we got it.
1,Got this for my little brother and he loves it And it's so inexpensive im not super worried about it being roughly used for a kid
1,The tablet was on a great day! I purchased multiple for a conference and they proved to be very effective and reliable.
1,"I originally purchased this as a gift for my daughter and quickly decided that I needed one for myself as well.For the price, you can't find a better screen on an e-reader. And the compact size makes it easy to take along with you anywhere. If you are thinking about the cheaper one, it's definitely worth the upgrade."
1,"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
1,Love it. Love reading on my new kindle. Should of bought sooner.
1,I wanted a simple device strictly for books. I did not want pop up pictures or current events running across the bottom of the screen. This is the tool for me. I keep one at home and one in the car for wait times at appointments.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my mother, she's not very tech savvy but she's able to easily navigate this tablet. She loves it and the price was great for the product."
1,"Happy yes, but all the advertisements are annoying. We knew they would always be there. It is what it is! We are iPad users and it is a step down from the iPad."
1,Great electronic product - would definitely recommend it
1,Comes in handy at work; allows for quick online pizza orders; has great games available; and helps me pass time reading a book when visiting the doctor.
1,Great quality this is the second one I got for my family
1,Got this to replace my son's cheaper tablet. It is well worth the extra money. He loves it.
0,Cheap but biggest problem is I can't get it to download apps. The Internet connection is very weak.
1,"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
0,"Owned roku for years. Bought fire tv to root to watch free tv and movies. Only a few apps vs roku. Roku-user friendly more apps.Fire tv- free movies, free recorded tv"
1,"For the price it's quite useful, especially for having people over"
1,"I love it, only thing sometimes I gotta keep repeating the wake up name to get it started, but after that, it's great"
1,Great little tablet for the money. Used some rewards certificates to pay for most of it. If I was to do it again I would buy the 16GB version. Very happy with the handy little tablet!
1,"Great price, very portable, fun for gaming, does the jub."
1,I bought this tablet as a cheap replacement for my son's tablet that stopped working suddenly. It seems to work well and he says he likes it alot. I am considering getting one for myself.
0,"This tablet is good for the price. Just be aware there is adware that cannot be removed unless you pay Amazon $15. There are other tablets available at a similar price without the adware if you are not interested in Amazon products or services. If you are looking for an Android tablet will be disappointed. This tablet has an Android operating system but it is not available due to the Amazon operating system overriding it. The screen resolution is average. If you are an Amazon user this is a good tablet, otherwise look elsewhere."
1,I bought this kindle as an upgrade for my first kindle fire
1,So easy to use and surprisingly good sound! Use it all the time!
1,Great tablet I purchased 4 for my nephews!!!!!!!!!
1,My son loves this tablet. I love all the child security i can put on it
1,The Echo has been great so far. I love to play Jeopardy on it. It was easy and fun to find kids music when my nieces were over and holiday music when we wanted to get in the spirit. I wish it could answer more questions and it struggles to find the weather for my house which is located in a decent size city.
0,For a device with 4k Technology they don't seem to advertise it much. You can barely see it on the box. Also search feature only works for Amazon. That's a waste of a search feature. Remote disconnects from the box often and your have to take the batteries out of the remote to reset it. I would not recommend until Amazon fixes the bugs.
1,Love my Fire TV box (along with two other Fire TV sticks) and downloaded Playstation Vue to watch TV and sports channels at half the cost of my monthly cable and past satellite TV bills.
1,I bought the Kindle Paperwhite as a gift for a 80 year old relative. The relative was very excited to get it and thoroughly enjoys using it.
1,"This kindle is really good for the price. Screen is too small for me,but for my daughter it is perfect. Does a lot of cool things."
1,I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them.
1,"I love my Amazon Fire, it's easy to download books, fun to read and I use it to catch up on my Facebook and email accounts."
1,The Fire TV works great and is very fast. Some apps are in the cloud but others have to be purchased through Amazon. Only problem was getting battery cover off of remote
1,"Has great picture, easy to use. Was able to put everything on it needed .easy download games"
1,"Still feeling my way, but if I have any more question will check with the geek squad."
1,Great very easy to use clear picture my 4 yr old grandson is happy
1,"It gets a lot of use since bought, my eyes will not hurt as much as using an ipad."
1,"Hi my name is Stephanie and I teach grades K-8 as a resource room instructor. I help to improve upon my students' reading and math learning goals and skills, and this tablet is great. I recently signed up for a trial membership with IXL, a skill-based website for kids. My students are able to work on their individual skills on this tablet in my classroom, and having it is a good resource. For $50, it is affordable and a great resource to have. Thank you, from Stephanie"
1,Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
1,works as it should.
1,This is such a great tablet for the price! Only regret was that I didn't buy another one for the Black Friday sale price
1,"What I really like is that you can set up different profiles( boy,girl and myself ) and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile.I bought 2 and kids are very happy."
1,The Kindle fire is very easy to use for anyone of any skill type with technology.
1,Its definitely a great purchase. Its definitely an upgrade from the fire stick.
1,"I purchased for my son, he said it is the best gift he has ever received"
1,The kindle paperwhits is great! It hold a charge for two weeks or more which is awesome. It's great to read in the sun and in darker areas or at night because of the backlit screen. Like how small and compact it is. Would def recommends getting one if you enjoy reading.
1,"From weather, news, music, an Uber ride or anything else it's right here! Just ask Alexa!!! Easy set up! My favorite gadget!"
1,Great tablet for the price. Does everything that I need it to do
1,"This kindle is great, but it requires a cover to protect the screen - it's easily scratched."
1,"I love the Fire TV concept. I had the Roku before and didn't like it so that went back to the store. I've played with the Fire TV for a couple of days and fell in love with it. All my Amazon contents are on here.I'm trying to cut my cable tv provider out and I think I found a good solution. When my FIOS contract end, I'm moving over to the Fire TV and I'll just get a HD antenna for the house. This unit is very fast and very capable. Based on the Android environment, you can do almost anything on here (entertainment wise.)"
1,So this is now hooked up to the Hue Lights and makes things a bit easier. Down side is now want to hook-up the apple tv/roku/tv etc and looking for an easy way to connect all these.Sound is good.Easy to installquick to train
1,"I purchased this device because I was tired of Direct Tv, Dish Network, and Time Warner increasing my bills with hidden charges. This device lets you dictate when and what you want to watch for free if you do some research. Yes this device is worth the effort it takes to set it up. It has let me say good bye to my monthly tv bill."
1,"Was not planning on buying this, but the price pulled me in. Glad I picked it up."
1,Super clear and crisp sound very clear and if you like it loud this speaker rocks
1,These thang are amazing....I have one and it replace my cable!!!!
1,I really like the tablet. It is very easy to work and the graphics are very good.
1,"You won't find a better value. Especially if you are a Prime member, this device is a fantastic basic tablet. Worth every penny."
1,"Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Inexpensive, works great and she has a lot of fun with it"
1,"This things great! I have it control, lights, my alarm system, & my thermostat. It integrates with IFTTT like a dream as well. The only drawback is having to remember all of the command phrases verbatim. Sound quality is pretty decent unless you turn it out real loud...."
1,This awesome little device is perfect for everyone. It has an expandable storage which allows you to add personal photos and videos to the Amazon Fire TV box. It's perfect for traveling especially when staying in hotels as you can watch subscribed programming anywhere. I recommend this product to everyone.
1,I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
1,Love it! It's great for what I wanted to do with it.
1,Great product for our little ones. They both recieved this for Christmas and love it.
1,I bought 4 of these and gave them to my nice and nephews for their Christmas gift. They are a awesome tablet for the price.
1,Got this for my grandmother who's not very tech savvy but she was able to learn how to use it quickly.
1,"good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for"
1,"Performs as expected. An excellent value, especially for lose looking for a reasonably priced gift for techies...or for kids!"
1,It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!
1,"Great sound..music sounds live as if at a concert..love that it seems to have a personality..does more than I imagined. The weather, news time date plays local radio stations and any song or app on my smart phone..can use in any room..loving my purchase."
1,Fire TV streams shows and movies without buffering at all
1,Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great
1,I find this product to be great on plane rides due to extended battery life and great section of reading material
1,"Echo is a good product, at a reasonable price; we use it everyday."
0,We have Google home and the Echo. We like Google Home better.
1,Works great without having to startup your laptop to look up items on Amazon.
1,I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
1,Perfect for traveling! wow they have lots of aps now glade I bought it.
1,"I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
1,The best companion period! Works great with most smart products! A must have!!
1,"I am more interested in Kindles for learning apps, and all educational books for adults & children (all ages)."
1,"I play music from my playlist and use the timer to keep time for my morning yoga exercises.. I listen to Pandora radio stations - morning raga, evening raga, jazz, instrumental, Bollywood and other radio stations. I check weather locally in Michigan, other locations in USA and abroad - Mumbai, India. I ask for movie show times and theater locations. I use the alarm feature often for appointments."
1,switched from a Toshiba 50 to Sony 48 and the clarity is outstanding
0,Good enough for the price. Great for Amazon subscriptions and Amazon shopping.
1,"The black friday price was good for this tablet. Too many ads, but for what I use it for, it is great."
1,I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old grandson. I took it out and set it up for hime before giving it to him. He refuses to put it down. I would recommend buying a very good case with it.
1,This is a good buy with the recent drop in price. Despite that I love how well it works. The voice recognition of the Echo is pretty good and I love the many questions you can ask it and the responses it gives you.
1,"I decided to buy an Amazon echo for my wife on Mother's Day. She was really impressed how well it functioned, and how knowledgeable Alexa is. Everyone should have one of these!"
1,"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
1,Bought for our son as a first tablet. He loves it and connects easily to our home wireless.
1,This is so fun to use for the whole family. We ask it so many questions and play music all the time.
1,"The convience of the Amazon Echo is instantly noticable! This is the first step I've taken towards building a ""smarter"" home and am loving it. Being able to grab information by just talking to this device is wonderful. Granted I do feel a little silly having her tell me jokes whenever I am home alone...but that aside this is a great device. The Echo can sync up with Hue lights, nest thermastats, etc. and I can't wait to try that out! Make sure to get Geek Squad Protection! Yes it is a few more bucks, but why not protect your investment? I'm sure it'll come in handy when I need it too."
1,Simple to use and great for beginners! I'm buying one for my son too.
1,"I had a kindle once before, and decided to try the fire. It was at a great price, and I love it."
1,Love the abundance of media outletsAvailable.love it!
1,"I purchased this Kindle Fire tablet as a gift for one of my grandkids. It has all the features they wanted on a tablet, plus it's so easy to use!"
1,For the price this is a great investment. With amazon prime it becomes loads of fun
1,A great and a very affordable tablet. Very compact and i love it.
1,"Bottom LED lighting is a bit uneven, and a bit distracting, but the overall package is otherwise excellent for reading, and without all the tempting distractions on a conventional tablet, so one can really focus on reading. The 300ppi is really crucial for images and especially maps and diagrams."
1,I bought this for my parents for Christmas. They loved it. It's funny to see your 60-something parents playing with such new technology. From my daughter who is four years old to my parents that are in their sixties good for everyone
1,The Amazon Fire Stick more than exceeded my expectations and the price is rediculously low for the quality and content....I went out and purchased more for family members and I know that I will buy more!!
1,"For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
1,I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it ever since. Echo is a way to go.
1,"Love my echo, we mostly use it for news briefs and music with amazon unlimited. Bought this for my relatives as a birthday gift. I'm sure they will love it as much as we do!"
1,"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price"
1,The wide wide world of TV at your finger tips! We love this!
1,"Love it, even though I don't have a lot of other smart products that alexa is compatible with."
1,"We love our amazon Fire TV's, this is our second one and we use them with netflix and hulu and our amazon prime video accounts, they work fantastically and we decided to stop paying for cable as theres usually nothing good on when we want to watch t.v. anyway!"
1,"This device is a must have if you have a Amazon Prime account. Just say it and ""she"" does/play it, and its getting better. Worth buying!!!"
1,Good inexpensive device. Still in touch with modern technology.
1,Great machine to add additional apps and games to any smart or non-smart TV. A must have for streamers.
1,it is awesome!! the only bad thing is you have to pay for unlimited music
1,"The tablets that I purchased have worked great for their purpose. Only problem I have is a couple glitches I keep running into. It's frozen up twice. I end up having to wait til it dies to restart it. Kinda sucks but other than that, my kids love it and I'm happy."
1,So good I bought 2 of them. Super fast and tons of movies to choose from
1,I bought this for my brother as a gift for graduating from his masters program. He has been telling me non-stop how much he loves it! He said the battery lasts really long and he is having fun filling it up with books to read!
1,This is a nice reader that we gave to our granddaughter. She enjoys he children’s books she can read and we enjoy the limited Wi-Fi capabilities.
1,"My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away."
1,"I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!"
1,"This is the best smart tv box out there, I've tried Roku, and I'm not a big fan, also have seen Apple TV, and used to own a google chrome cast, but the amazon tv is the easiest to use, and I think is the best bang for the buck! Even if you have a smart TV I recommend buying an Amazon tv box. Watching any Netflix, or Amazon prime videos is easy, loads super fast, and works great. Especially if you download the Kodi app on the box!! I am a loyal customer as I have 4 Amazon tv boxes in my home!"
1,This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
1,Works great very happy. Loads very fast and easy to use !
1,Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
1,Can it be an intercome also when using an Echo Dot?
1,I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
1,"Great price on Black Friday! Works perfectly as a child's tablet for educational games teaching letters, numbers, math, etc."
1,Great tablet for the price. Got it for my daughter. She loves it.
1,"I have eBook readers on my iPad, but my Kindle is much more enjoyable to use for reading books. It's lighter weight and non glare screen make a big difference."
1,Got tablet for my son as a Christmas gift. He will enjoy it as I have one myself
1,"I love my echo. She would be amazing if she could Google things, but we can't have it all. Love that the kids can tell Alexa to put something on the list and it shows up on my phone"
1,"I enjoy being able to view all the online videos that are out there. This allows me to view everything I could imagine with the added ability to view videos that I have ripped from my dvd collection. I didn't give it a 5 because I can only figure out how to view movies on the Micro SD card not the included USB connection and it tends to abort after an hour or so on a couple of movies I wanted to watch. Not sure why, others are fine."
1,Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry.
1,"So far, I have used my Echo as a Bluetooth speaker. I have not interact with the device with my Amazon account (turning it off when not being use as a speaker)."
1,Works perfect for my niece! She loves it! Great Deal!
1,"An excellent choice for an inexpensive tablet, the Fire is easy to use wherever WiFi is available. The only minor drawback I've found is the touch-screen is not very sensitive and at times doesn't respond at all."
1,biased in favor of right handed persons but performs as promised. it would be nice if a lefty could move pages with his left hand as a righty can move pages with his right hand.
1,I really like the tablet. It was easy to set up everything on it. The only complaint is that it is a bit slow. I love that I can add storage to it when needed.
1,"Right Price, Works, Great, Best Buy has a great selection"
1,Great for streaming kodi and much faster than firestick
1,Everything I was looking for! My mother needed a larger viewing area than her phone for Internet.
1,I bought this for my toddler and its perfect. He is rough with it and it still works. I wanted something that I use to teach him the basics of using a tablet and this worked great. It comes with a 2 yrs warranty.
1,Works great with my new kindle!
1,Great product I recommend it to everyone who loves watching tv
1,"The picture quality is very close to the Roku ultra.I love the alexa,but it is a little bit of a gimmick"
1,The Alexa device is awesome. The sound quality from the Bluetooth speaker is the best for the price point. Perfect audio quality streaming from phone or from the connect apps. Setup is not that bad!
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I also like that I can control acess and get emailed copy of all apps she dowloads
1,This was a Christmas gift for my 2 year God son and he absolutely loves it
1,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves to check temperatures outside and loves listen to the music of his choice. He would recommend this to others but is worried about the security or lack of. We have heard since that it is easy for others to spy on you because it is connected to Wifi.Overall, it seems to be a great electronic."
1,My mother-in-law loves her tablet! I purchased it at a great price as well.
1,This is my second Kindle Fire and it is even better than the first.
1,I LOVE THIS ECHO AND ITS HANDS FREE. LOUD SPEAKERS
1,"I have this cover in black and my cover does indeed fold back on itself. Not sure why the other review stated that the cover does not... I wrapped the elastic band around the back part of the cover and this works great to keep it secure and out of the way. The magnets on the back help to stop from opening the cover the wrong way, but I used a small piece of two faced tape on the back of the Kindle and no more trouble opening it the wrong way now, works great! I am very happy with this cover."
1,"Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy."
0,Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive
1,"Fire TV is an awesome tool easy to use and designed to be quick, light, and filled with options."
1,Very satisfied with the size and performance and a great deal
1,"I love this thing. I am a bit of a bibliophile and obsolutely love books. This isn't to replace books, but it makes stories more accessible. It's easy to use. Has great better life. It's perfect."
1,You don't have to pay a high cable bill if you purchase product.
1,Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
1,"Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything"
0,while the price was great the tablet is filled with advertising and is getting slower and slower with usage...
1,The remote works great manually or in voice mode. It takes a little time to learn to navigate the applications. But it was a good purchase.
1,"We bought Amazon Echo for my mother's Christmas gift. She is not that tech savy and she was able to set up Alexa on her own. She loves Alexa and talks to her all day. For Mom, Alexa is amazing."
1,I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
1,"I bought this tablet for my little brother. He was used to Google's Android operating system. This tablet runs on Amazon's system, but is more user friendly. He loves this tablet and it was easy for him to learn."
1,"Just speak into the remote and your thrust on a journey through movies,Internet and shopping."
1,Me and my husband love them ..we bought 2 for our kids and they love them so easy to use .... and the kids profile is great
1,"Excellent, well worth the money. Great screen, easy to use."
1,I bought the fire for my grandson and he loves it.
1,Great item. Timely transaction. 2 thumbs up! GREAT
1,"Works well, sounds great, fills up bedroom with good sound and controls lights. Good value at under $100 (current sale)."
1,I was really impressed by this tablet compared to the price. It's not the fastest but it gets the job done and a convenient size. I allow my daughter to use this when doing research for homework. It's basically enough so she doesn't get sidetracked and it's advanced enough for me to complete my more advanced tasks. Great value for the price.
1,All is well. Haven't heard any complaints. Hopefully he will use it to help with his school work and not just play games with it.
1,"I personally liked the echo, I went out to purchase the dot. I am well satisfied with both products. The echos sound quality is amazing for my living space."
1,great tablet for web access and works well gaming no reason to spend more unless you need a larger screen
1,Love my tablet was going to by laptop but bought this instead cause this is cheaper
1,like the on request weather and traffic. Music selection with prime is very good
1,E-Reader battery doesn't hold up as long as stated.
1,Bought for my son liked the price. He likes it but had some trouble with screen brightness and resetting it.
1,I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
1,"One of the best streaming devices available currently especially for the cost. The app store gives you access to all the major streaming services - Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, etc. The only knock on it is that it places heavy focus on Amazon Prime videos for obvious reason. As a side benefit (pun intended) - you can put SPMC/Kodi/XBMC on it like I have and combined with a HDHOMERUN it is now a cable box replacement. It is the only box I have plugged into my TV and use it for Live TV, DVR, Movies, Videos, Pictures, and all the streaming apps. Powerful little unit that saves on electricity and space compared to HTPC that was hooked up before. No more monthly cable box rental fee's so it pays for itself in a few months."
1,I was really surprised at how much you can do with Fire TV. Thank you
1,"great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request."
1,This is the second one we have purchased and we really enjoy it.
1,Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature.
1,"This is an excellent value. This is easy to read, easy to use and performs like a champ. If you want an all around great reader but don't want to pay a high price, this is the one."
1,easy for my 88 year old mom to use. screen is clearly visible.
1,How did I ever live without this the sound quality is amazing and extremely easy to set up
1,hi got this tablet to view books and use netflix while i travel nice sound can charge by my external battery last few hours nice to have
1,"I love that there's no glare in sunlight and I can adjust the light on my paperwhite so that I can read in bed while my husband is sleeping. I thought I'd never switch from regular books, but I enjoy my kindle so much that I no longer purchase the paper copies."
1,my grand daughter and grand son love to play games on their kindles plus their mother put programs on there so they can learn
1,Easy to use. Like all of the features. Lightweight.
1,Amazon fire t.v. is a great media system. Great alternative to the outrageous price of cable t.v.
1,"Tons of things Alexa can do!!!!! PLay music, tell jokes, uodates on news, make phone calls. Juts a great new technology that makes life a ton easier"
1,awesome for this price i purchased it o thanksgiving for just $35
1,My son uses the device to help him do his homework
1,I love the Amazon Echo so much I ordered two plus am planning on ordering the echo dot along with the nest thermostat 5 Switches that are Alexa enabled and the ecobee that is Alexa enabled. I would highly recommend them to friends and family.
1,Easy to use and easy to load apps. Wish it had a GPS
1,"I've had every Kindle since they came out and have been impressed by the innovation, design, and overall quality. This one is the exception on all counts. Lightning issues on the bottom of the reader are distracting and I don't see a visible difference from the older models. Evidently, production is of higher value than quality."
1,"I LOVE my echo! You can do so much with it. I check the weather every morning, play music on command and my daughter was using it to practice her Italian. Just bought both the kids the echo dots for their birthdays. Everything connects!"
1,"Third Kinlde and my favorite as I can easily read in sunny conditions. Light weight, more compacy and battery life seems excellent."
1,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
1,"Fast, supports ultra 4K, expandable memory, side load apps.What's not to love?"
1,Great product haven't streamed 4k content as I don't have a 4k TV but it handle streaming of prime content and my plex server.
0,Lots of stuff available to add to enhance performance.
1,This is my second Kindle. I wore out the first one! I truly enjoy the PaperWhite edition as I can read in bed without any other lights on.
1,Was looking for something for my son to play games on while traveling and this was very inexpensive and great quality. The charger is not nearly as long as it needs to be but otherwise it is a great product.
1,Love the Echo. East set up. Lots of fun. Can't wait to get more smart devices to get to work with it.
1,"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!"
1,"Its nice to have a companion that only talks when spoken to ,Alexa is the only women who doesn't argue lol"
1,Lightweight and handy. The screen is really easy on the eyes.
1,"Bought it for my 16yr old for Christmas and she loved it...uses it to surf the internet and social media. Also uses it for movies and music. Great deal for the price, would recommend."
1,Great buy if you are not needing the backlight. Easy to use and battery lasts for weeks.
1,"If you like to read but don't want a lot of clutter, or just don't have the space for dozens of books on your shelf then this is the solution. The layout is simple to use and the screen is perfect. Reading in direct sunlight isn't an issue thanks to the matte finish of the e-ink display. The battery on this thing will outlast any other electronic you have in your house.My only complaint/issue is that as a avid reader off comic books, this device thanks to the nature of the display don't allow me to enjoy my favorite medium."
1,My tablet is the best thing I have gotten from you
1,"Nifty gadget, useful and easy to carry around. Just enough performance and features needed for a tablet for its price range. I would recommend this item for those who wanting to try a tablet."
1,Love everything about the tablet! I would recommend this to a friend
0,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
1,"This is my fourth Kindle; one was lost, but the other two simply died after a few years. I resent paying good money for something which such a short lifespan. A kindle is a great aide for readers who travel. How else to take dozens of books along? But I wish they were more long lived."
1,"I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use."
1,Bought it for my grandson he loves it. He is 5 and he know his way around the kindle better than I do.
1,"thin and excellent design!most of all, the Amazon fire price was good for thanksgiving gifts.Kids and Youth liked very much!"
1,Limited use if you dont want to enroll with amazon
1,Works way faster than my android box and is just awsome
1,"Does what they want, games, educational apps, and has parental controls."
1,This is a great alternative to an iPad especially for the price!! I would definitely recommend!!
1,This is a great device if you listen to music in the house or have smart devices. The speaker isn't top of the line but it is plenty good for the average listener.
1,I bought this to use for streaming services and it works great
1,"The Echo is fun, functional and entertaining. The commands are appropriately responded to approximately 80% of the time. The ability to simply orally request songs by a specific artist or a specific song is amazing. The music catalogue is extremely large and wide ranging. News, weather and straight forward informational requests are almost always answered correctly and clearly. The technological applications are varied and growing. They don't interest me--yet. The music alone makes this device a marvel and a bargain."
1,"This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I used to buy books all the and then they were just laying around after I read them, now I can buy them (for a cheaper price, at that) and they're all in one place, not taking up ANY space."
1,Amazon fire is a good size to carry about and easy to use.You can do so much with it just like a small computer as wellAs being an e-reader. Excellent buy
1,Good for on the go. Keep in mind that some apps are not compatible due to it being Amazon and not Android. Overall a good purchase.
1,"This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.)"
1,"I like the echo, but too much to look up with the skills."
1,bought this for my grandson as i had bought one a year before for my other grandson. Great for younger ones
1,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and she loves it! It is so easy to operate, and has so much in its library for music!"
1,My nephew always uses my sister's iphone when watching videos. He loves his youtube videos lol. So I went out and bought him this. The kid loves it. There's value in the cartoon membership also
1,Replaced this tablet after the kids got hold of my mom's one because they love playing their games on it
1,Great small tablet with great value!Must get one ASAP... You can't beat this price!!
1,Perfect for cutting the cord on expensive cable and satellite
1,Worked well just was misinformed of the ability to download Google Play... Was told it was easy to.
1,We enjoy using the fire tv. Since we are prime members we also get free movies
1,It works great I would definitely recommend it to a friend I would buy a few more if I had to but the price should drop down a little bit
1,The product was overall worth the money spent. Love it !!!
1,This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
1,"Lots of pre installed apps, fast os, and rf remote"
1,"Good tablet for browsing, watching videos and playing games.Totally worth the price."
1,I absolutely love my echo because I am lazy to log on my computer to ask google. Also I get multi use of it as my personal Pandora music box. The only downside to this is Alexa can't hear you if your room is big because of echoing in the background....also I forgot her name once and had to walk next to her to turn her off. Other than that...I love her!
1,we use it all the time. it is handy and the kids love to play with it as well. its pretty durable as well. its bounced off the floor a couple times and still works fine
1,We had another smart home hub that wasn't the echo and it broke down twice. So far the Amazon echo can do more and doesn't glitch out. It's so worth the extra $$
1,I love using it to read.....have all my books loaded and ready for when I travel.
1,"This was an excellent gift for my wife. She always wanted a standard kindle, but this was one that a few of her friends had. She loves the display and I like that I can sleep beside her when she reads at night. Perfect for someone who doesn't like the phone backlight."
1,The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.
1,I love it. I have several all of kids enjoy it and so do I
1,"This new technology keeps us informed of a lot of everyday things...weather, news, traffic, etc.! We also enjoy the Prime music and so much more. We already had the Echo dot and that has been move to my office and I enjoy all the same feathures from it while I'm working in there!"
1,Don't hesitate to buy. Very user friendly platform.
1,I have really enjoyed binge watching shows on Netflix and exploring all the options I have with the fire stick.
0,Considering this was under fifty dollars I am satisfied with it.
1,"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it."
0,Easy to read books. Great for night reading. Easy to download books
0,I eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the back-light when using it at night. It was okay at day time but at night during which I usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product. Especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode. I guess Amazon needs a better QA department.
1,"Great tablet for toddlers. Easy yet fun. I purchased two tablets for my grandkids, ages 2 and 4. They both love it and enjoy playing with it."
1,"Okay but needs a lot of improvements, but for simple stuff is good."
1,I love my amazon echo.. Dont know how i was able to live without it!! Cabt reccomend enough!
1,"The kindle is great for general, all-purpose use of a tablet/e-reader."
1,Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
1,"If you just want to place it and listen to music, this is a great unit. If you have a stereo get the dot."
1,Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
1,backlight feature is great for reading on an airplane when overhead lights are too bright.
1,I thought this for my 8 year old and she loves it.
1,Easy to set up and very convenient to operate. The sound is very good.
1,I like that you can choose to use wifi or Ethernet cable
1,Very easy to learn and use. The device does a great job clearing understanding you with out having to talk funny
1,I brought it for my boys and they love it. Great investment
0,"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
1,Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature.
1,Great purchase and the product is amazingly simple
1,"I decided to buy my son a tablet. After lots of research, this turned out to be the best one for it's price point. It even has expandable memory! So if you want a simple go to tablet I highly recommend this one!"
1,I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
1,I had purchased a Google Home first and was disappointed that Google Home would not play my music that I had uploaded to Google Play. The Amazon Echo will play uploaded music to amazon. Would recommend this over Google Home however I am sure that they will update the Google Home to be able to play uploaded music since it just came out.
1,Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
1,"This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker."
1,Easily accesible wonderful for my kids stays charged long time
1,"Great device, I did exchange it for a white one. It would work better if I had better internet connection at my house."
1,These are made for the Echo and as I use my Echo in a couple ends of the house so it is convenient to have the two of them
1,We love our Amazon Fire TV. It is fast and runs Netflix with no lag or stops. Super happy with it in all aspects.
1,Easy to order items from Amazon right from your tablet
1,Needed something that I could read at night without using a light. The backlight is perfect.
1,Great tablet for the price. I got 2 for my kids and they love it
1,Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire
1,"Great tablet, light, small and inexpensive for entry level consumers that have an Amazon Prime account. Combined with the amazon free content to prime members (books,movies,games) and amazon underground, this tablet is on fire! Plus easy on the wallet should something bad happens to it."
0,"I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad! I really wanted to like it."
1,I bought this for my sister as a birthday gift and she loves it.
1,The only thing that could have been better than this great great deal would have been the tablet being free. What a great tablet at an amazing price. I'll buy another at its regular price I like it so much.
1,So easy to use my parents can even figure it out good quality
1,"Works well with voice commands i.e. Music, weather, my sports teams and shopping. I have purchased two of these and no more cd's with my music."
1,easy to use and navigate. controller is not complicated.
1,Purchased these for our parents as a gift. Easy to use and entertaining. Amazon prime is a must.
1,This keyboard does it all for the beginner or for the professional. The keys have a real piano feel with some resistance. The speakers are amazing. The choice of instrument sounds are outstanding and the tone of those instruments are right on.
1,"Great screen, very fast, very portable, and light."
1,Great works as expected
1,This item is excellent for easy search of movies and shows. Highly recommended!
1,"amazon-fire tv, easy install,very easy to start using."
1,This was actually for my daughter and she has rarely put it down since she got it.
1,If you have prime it's great for the money. Slow performance tho
1,I used a Nook reader for several years but got no customer service when I needed anything. The Kindle customer service is truly first class and the reader is a quality item.
1,Bought for friend so could have face time with grandbaby.
1,I purchased this and was on the fence but after using it I have purchased more.
1,Best bang for the buck if your looking for a good tablet that don't cost a lot just buy yourself a micro SD an you won't run out of memory
1,I own an older model but wanted to get my relatives a good and fairly priced tablet and the kindle goes above and beyond. Great price on an excellent tablet. I purchased 3 and everyone loved them and they are easy to use as well! I would recommend to anyone at any age!
1,The product is very durable and is great for children
1,It was a great gift to give for some one who can not afford a tablet.
1,The kindle fire is so handy and easy to use.We own 4
1,Had an older kindle and this new model is way better. The lighting is much improved.
1,I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better.
1,Gave this to my wife for her birthday and she's very happy with it.
1,I have owned several Kindles and this is the best one yet
1,This was well received. A wonderful upgrade from a first gen Kindle.
1,"I got this as part of a Prime Day kindle bundle, and it works just fine. However, there doesn't appear to be any difference between this charger and the 5 other ones I have, all of which were much cheaper. If it wasn't part of the bundle I purchased, I would have never purchased this by itself."
0,The best advice I can give after 3 devices and 2 years later
1,I now have two. Alexa is awesome. I use it every day.
1,This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews.
1,"This would be my only ereader, perfect for days outside in sun or at beach, etc."
1,Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch.
1,Great products. Works perfect. Get to watch a lot of shows and movies.
0,"Not for the average computer person. Very confusing instructions. I spent several hours trying to install the ""overdrive"" so I could get e-books from the library. Ran the battery down several times with no luck. I got so disgusted I had to just put it down. (I'm still trying because I refuse to give up) Thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!)"
1,This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.
1,My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to
1,"Bought 2 for our sons, ages 4 & 6. They love them and my boys are rough on everything especially electronics but these held up so great I ended up buying another to use as my work e-reader."
1,Absolutely LOVE my Echo! Sound is much louder than I expected it to be so it's very easy to hear!! Great for playing music and she'll play anything you want to hear!! The shopping list feature is awesome and the fact that it goes right to my phone so I can check it at the store is great!! Highly recommend!!
0,"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time."
1,It's a great product to help make your home smarter & more convenient. Being able to set a timer while cooking or play a song without pulling out your phone. Being able to set up WiFi plugs to turn on lights in the house are also a plus.
1,Inexpensive beginner tablet for little kids. Has anything they can ask for for a good price. Amazon did a good job on offering technology to practically anybody.
1,I didnt realize how handy she is until i decided to pick one up last week when Best Buy had a Flash Sale
1,We use it to control programmable robots Dash and Dot. A great low cost solution - would rather have kids beat up the kindle fire instead of an expensive iPad
0,I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
1,The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage.
1,Most definitely worth the money. I bought the fire tv box after owning a firestick and it is a great device especially if you are an amazon prime member. Twice the speed of the firestick with availability to add external hard drives and memory cards. Bluetooth enables you to add keyboards and game controllers if you wish. Also has an ethernet port so you don't have to use WiFi. I absolutely love it and if I had the choice I would buy a fire tv box rather than a firestick.
1,"I love kindle paper white , as it is lightweight , and the feeling is the same as reading a book because of the background color ,"
1,Ordered This product for the children and they love it i might purchase one for my self have it a week and seems stable
1,Great device was able to side load apps cause the system is android based.
1,This is really the best one on the market. I was lucky to get such a good price at Best Buy! Thanks!
1,She initially didn't think she would like it as she preferred reading an actual book. She changed her mind after a couple of days and now really prefers it. Easy to use
1,"Very Nice tablet. Works very well. No issues. Nice video, and excellentwireless wifi, just a very smooth unit."
1,"I never thought that I would need an e-reader since I have the samsung Note, but I am now would not read on the Note anymore. The paperwhite makes reading so much better, my eyes don't feel tired as quick with the paperwhite. Highly recommended!!!"
1,"So far this has been a great product. Very easy setup and the remote fits nicely in your hand, similar to Apple TV remote but larger"
1,This kindle is a basic and easy to use eReader. Exactly what I wanted. The charge lasts for a long time so you don't have to worry about charging it daily.
1,This device requires a little more effort to learn than one would expect. Music is better through paid music service. have to be patient to look through available apps in echo app.
1,This work great to my nephews for Xmas this year it's easy to use and to set up. Price is great and I would recommend to my friends.
1,"Pick this up on impulse. Love it, have to go take it from the kids all the time."
1,"What you think you need more than a Kindle to surf the web? You don't. Cheap and effective. Plus it's an alarm clock too, plus with the right apps it's a radio, what's that you say a clock/radio? You know it hipsters."
1,Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price
1,"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
1,I was surprised at how easy it was to start-up and to use. It has more possibilities than I thought it would before we purchased.
1,"Enjoy listening to music, playing games, getting weather, and hearing news updates while I am working in the kitchen. Great speaker. I only wish we could change her name... I have added the tap and echo to our home as well. Also purchased one as a gift for my son."
1,"Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
1,Bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality. The case protects it well.
1,the kindle fire tablet was easy to use and very simple to set up. Great tablet
1,"something that will get very useful as time goes by, well made, and works great!!!!!!!"
1,Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.
1,After reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. Our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. The thick padded case really does work wonders for this.
1,great for finding local info while traveling. Useful for weather and morning news brief.
1,"NEED A CHEAP ALTERNATIVE TO A TABLET, THIS IS IT !"
1,This is the third Kindle I have purchased (not counting a Kindle Fire). I love the paper white. It is so easy on older eyes and the adjustable font size and brightness make reading a Kindle easier than a book . The screen is crystal clear whether in bright sunlight or in the dark. It is light weight which (like with older eyes) makes it easier for older hands to hold. I download a lot of library e books and can carry unlimited reading materials with me in a compact package. I would recommend this product to anyone who reads.
1,"Bought three of these for a 4, 6, and 10 year olds. I am so glad that it is so simple to use. They love that the can easily find books and games that suit each of their interests. For $34.99, it was so worth it."
1,We had visited some friends who had Alexa and we had so much fun with her. Went home and ordered our own!
1,Simple to use. Has its hiccups but for 50 bucks its the best bang for the buck. Purchased for my 6 year okd to replace an older generation model
1,This product is very impressive. Used every day ty
1,I enjoy my alexa. So much I bought one for my friend.
1,The amazon fires are super to use. You can do more than read a book on them.
0,So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
1,Anxious to get set up. Read all reviews and seems best to set up.
1,My grandkids love's it always on it great learning tool
1,I used to be able to find these with fold in prongs wish there was that option- but it simple and well made.
1,"I was able to nab this tablet for 40 bucks on sale and it's a great vacation tablet. There is a lot less pressure in losing this tablet and it fills all my basic needs of accessing Facebook, reading books, accessing internet and playing the occasional game. It's also the perfect tablet for the kids after purchasing a good case for it. 40 dollar tablet and they lose it? Drop in the bucket compared to losing/breaking a 300 dollar iPad."
1,I use Alexa every day! From using the Amazon Echo with smart home devices to little questions the Echo is a must have!
1,Good for the price hard to beat it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!"
1,Love the kindle. Great for the price. I brought 3 of them.
1,very good
1,Wife had a paper white but needed something to listen to her scribd account. I paid $33 for this thing.. worth do much more.
1,Great product works great and the application will work with the future updates to keep up the great work and I have the same info.
1,Got this half price on sale...has a good speaker and I use it with amazon...can do just about everything as far as controlling smart devices in home...it will also stream local radio stations...I keep it on kitchen counter...just get it on sale!
1,I got is for one of my family members and he loves it
1,For the price it seems like a very good tablet. I was disappointed that it came with absolutely NO instructions. So if you were new to tablets you could find yourself at a complete loss as to how to set it up.
1,There are thousands of reviews and I have nothing new to add
1,Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
1,Great sound for music. Easy to install and use. Alexa is good and quick with her answers. I like the news briefs in the mornings.
1,Haven't really utilized the device yet. Have been very busy. Can't wait to sit down and see what it can do.
1,I love the Kindle Paperwhite. It is thin and light weight. It is easy on my eyes. Easy to throw in my purse when I'm heading out.
1,"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
1,Amazon FireTV is a powerful little box. Worth the extra money over the Firestick. Great interface. Can connect your phone and type input. Alexa capability too.
1,This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
1,Bought for my youngest and he loves it.. very easy to work and fast downloading. Great investment until he wants the real thing..
1,"It is a good tablet for the kids to play their games on. Only drawback is the way the cord plugs into the kindle. We have had to fix 2 kindles because of this issue. For the price though, it's worth it."
1,Tablet is great for 7 inches. Touch screen works great
1,"Amazon Fire tv is better then fire stick, roku 1,2& 3Streaming is too fast. You will not notice any delays"
1,"satisfied with my purchase!needed upgrade from original kindle, wanted for outside use.small and compact."
1,"My grand daughter loves it, hasn't put it down since we bought it from her. Clear picture, runs great, she loves to watch videos and play music."
1,This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.
1,"My husband wanted this for Fathers Day, so I got it for him. He loves it, and I do too. We get the temperature and forecast each morning, set timers for our grandkids playing on electronics, set alarms, play music, and the grandkids get Alexa to tell them jokes. It is amazing, and we talk to her all day. The technology is so outstanding."
1,"Cant believe we waited to buy one, love how easy it is to use and the interaction with all my devices!!"
1,"He was amazed that he can serf the web, go onto face book, place amazon orders. Read books so quickly.Play games and likes the front and back cameras."
1,Works great. Faster than fire stick and supports sub keyboard haven't figured out how to configure keyboard for Bluetooth.
1,"it's a bit flimsy, but does stand up, so I'm not complaining..."
1,This is a must for Prime members great sound and can be used as Bluetooth speaker to boot.
1,The size is nice it's light weight no glare When outside in the day great for night reading too
1,"It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
0,"Summary says it all really. It works, but its not really very useful."
1,Enjoying it. Still learning. Probably even better when I get used to it.
1,This kindle is awesome. Great picture fast internet.
1,Lots of fun direct Alexa. Just need to be very direct with wording of commands. Continue to improve with software iterations.
1,The size and clarity of this fire tablet is very nice
1,Bought two of these for my kids and they love it!!
1,"This is my first ""smart"" product, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm still learning everything that it can do. So far, so good, but I have noticed a few glitches. Overall, I really like it. I can't wait to set it up with some home automation."
1,"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use"
1,Great product but needs to learn more. It would be nice if it could connect to tv sound.
1,The kindle fire is such a great tablet with alot of different apps and so easy to use.
1,I love it! Loaded lots of things for my self and kids. The price was also great !! Even my kinds can use it easily . I have recommended it to many of my friends and family . Enjoying it to the fullest . I use over wifi and with my internet as well
1,We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
1,Works great just make sure you have wifi and an Amazon account.
1,Great new device for the whole family. We added HUE lights and Nest camera.
1,I'm very glad having this with me. In my country there are lots of books in Spanish that I'm not able to get. So this was perfect solution.It's incredible how similar to paper is. Battery super long!
1,"UPDATE! 11/11/15: More than a year now of using the stick literally every single evening for netflix, and it has been overall very reliable.Bottom line This is the best streaming device for the dollar(In my humble opinion) It's cheap, it handles netflix/prime/hboGo/plex/games/a lot more doesn't seem much slower than the full firetv box. I started with a Roku2 in the living room which got pushed to the bedroom when i got the firetv box, then the firetv stick replaced the roku2. I tried the roku stick but returned it because it was just too darn slow. I'm completely firetv now and 100 happy with it..What it does: It adds internet/streaming functionality to any tv/monitor with an HDMI port. You can use any of the thousands of paid and/or free apps such as netflix, amazon prime, hulu, plex, news, digital fireplace, etc... There's a ton you can do. With some extra effort you can sideload things like Kodi and 3rd party apps. It's super simple to use, and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast.The Good stuff...-Same pricerange as the less capable/less powered Chromecast Roku stick-More ram/memory than the competition(keeps things running smooth)-More storage space than the competition, you can store more apps/games/etc..-You can do some gaming with it, but the firetv box is better suited-So small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease.-Simple clean interface.-Lots of games/apps to choose from-The phone app is actually pretty usefulNot as good stuff...-No connections other than usb for power, if you need ethernet/audio in/out, get the box!Read more"
1,Good purchase for what I needed it for. Easy to use
1,"Keyboard isn't as good as the original Fire HD that we've had for about 4 years. Also the email program is not as good as it doesn't allow for moving multiple emails at the same time. Other than that, this is an easy to use tablet for a very low price."
1,"My daughter had her 8"" Kindle Fire HD stolen earlier this year so when we saw this one on sell over the Thanksgiving holiday it was a no brainier to purchase it since it was $100 cheaper than the Fire we purchased a year ago, granted the Fire HD has a much crispier screen but for my 9 year old daughter, she is now happy just to have a tablet again. And it can do all the things she needs it to do: read books, play games, skype, etc."
1,Great device. Good quality sound in a speaker. Super convenient.
1,"Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too"
1,Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.
1,Purchased as part of a bundle with a Logitech remote. Not sure I would buy it alone. The discount was too good to pass up. I guess it's cool. Not sure how much I can do with it other than playing music and waking me up in the morning. We'll see.
1,"My brother bought this for me as a Christmas gift and I'm in love. I've already read 6 books because of the ease in which I can read my books anywhere, anytime. I don't need wifi, the battery lasts forever (seriously. I've charged it once since I've owned it and I've read 6 books!) The lighting feature allows me to read at night in bed once my husband has already fallen asleep. I love this Kindle SO MUCH!"
1,Love to ask Alexa questions. Easiest alarm to set. Has so many uses that are easy to learn.
1,Bought this as a starter tablet for my mom. Easy to use with great price
1,"I wanted a small tablet for reading books, checking email, reading the news and going on Facebook. It works great, and is much less expensive than an iPad."
1,I love this tablet. One of the best out there on the market.
1,"Purchased this for my niece for Christmas. She loves it. Great for the kids, or if you're not looking for anything specific. Lightweight, easy on the eyes. You don't mind spending that money especially for a kid that may break it...because they're kids."
1,"She doesn't go a day without reading something on there. She says it works wonderful outside, which is exactly what she wanted. She also has a fire, but doesn't work that well for her outside."
1,does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms.
1,"Had an Apple TV, but as an Amazon Premiere member was missing out on a lot of free stuff. This is easy to navigate and filled in the gap."
1,Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
1,Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
1,Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
1,This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
1,"Amazon echo has been a great product. We are able to turn our lights on and off, get the news, sports and traffic and even schedule calendar events just by asking Alexa to perform the task. Love this product. Can't wait for further integration with our home."
1,My sister in law is in love with this. Best gift ever for her
1,Save some $$ for hight price cable tv!!! This is the reason why i cancelled my cable tv
1,"This is not the first time, I bought these tablet several times, because they work excellent, I sent one for my best friend and she love it, I like everything from this product."
1,Got it for Christmas. Have used it almost everyday. Liked it so much got one for my dad.
1,A very good price for the tablet. The sound volume is a little low. Needed someone with technical knowledge to help me set-up the tablet.
1,Gift for my mother in law she really liked it but it heats up a little to much.. it's good overall
1,"The Echo is the start of a very long relationship. I'm able to order on Echo, listen to music, and have a joke told to me."
1,Does everything a tablet is so-pose to do. Good battery life.
1,My wife loves it she uses it every night to read her romance novels so if my wife's happy I'm happy!!!
1,Its effective and responsive although it has a hard time with backgound noise and needs to be away from a wall. Works well
1,Great tablet everything i wanted in a tablet thanks
1,"I bought this for my 6yr-old & am impressed w/the 1yr subscription to free-time that was included, and the additional 2yr manufacturer warranty. The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!"
1,"Purchased for the TV in another room after cutting the cord. It's better than my Fire Stick, as this one comes with voice search and is ready for 4K. Best Buy has it on sale at $85, do recommend."
1,The Echo is great! There are so many uses for it. Love it!
1,Between this and an hd antennae I cut cable and I am never going back!!
1,"Simple and deluxe, functions well and holds up- even with kids and their paws. Its layout and usability a bit confusing at first. Watch out for amazon add ons to charge your account though."
1,It's so easy to use and is a lot of fun to have. Alexa has become part of our house and family
1,This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I've bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options.
1,My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
1,I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.
1,"Bought for my nephew for Christmas. I'm sure he will enjoying watching movies, reading books, and listening to music."
1,"Got this for a present for someone, and they love it. They really wanted an e reader not a tablet and that's why he loves it."
1,I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
1,"For the price, it's hard to beat. Don't go into this thinking it is like any other Android tab. In many ways it is, and the ability to sideload apps helps. But this is primarily a vehicle to get you into the Amazon ecosystem. Not necessarily bad, but those expecting full access to Google will be disappointed.What it is good for:Web surfingNewsreaderAudio playerNetflix, Hulu, etcWhat's not so great:No GPS, location enabled but not true GPSScreen Resolution, angles and clarity are good but given the price, it can be forgiven"
1,the box is very fast and doesn't have any buffering
1,We bought two of these for Christmas for our girls and they have been great. Educational apps are easy to find and utilize plus Amazon prime access gives great selection of movies etc. frustrated with too many ads though so I only gave it 4 stars
1,Purchased the Kindle for my 9 year old niece and have not had any complaints. Every function performs like it should.
1,Already have a few other Alexas. Wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker. Works as expected.
1,About this as a present for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it because not only can she play all her apps but she can also use it to read her books
1,"This is a great tablet for us seniors because it is not overly complicated to use. The 7"" screen is just the right size for old eyes. This amazon tablet is perfect for most things we need to use a tablet for. The batteryseems to last a long time. It is a great buy."
1,"Overall I'm pleased with the Kindle Paperwhite. The text is sharp and easy to read, the memory is more than adequate for all the books I could want to have available. Battery life is excellent, going for weeks without charging.It does not get 5 stars from me though. The processor is a bit slow causing a time lag to go from screen to screen or to navigation pages, I also have Kindle on my Note 4 and appreciate the lag-free response of the Samsung. Navigation is a bit cumbersome since there are no physical buttons, the ""BACK"" button in particular is missed.Having a dedicated Kindle device with great battery life and an amazing screen makes the Paperwhite worth having for me in spite of a few areas where it can be improved."
0,Not easy to setup. Everything is apps which you must memorize the directions. Need to take a course to use. Not user friendly.
1,"It works well with the Apps, easy to connect to the internet"
1,I purchased this echo as a gift it was exactly what she wanted
1,I bought it as a present for my little sister. She loves it so much that when she got it she did not take her hands off of it and started reading right away! Such a good kindle.
1,This product is amazing and I would recommended to anybody!!!
1,"Such a great deal for a small fee, just right for a toddler of three."
1,Every app that I needed with no problems. No other app runs as well for the price.
1,Great product. I bought both the Fire TV and the Fire Stick. The stick is going back and I'm going to buy more of these for the rest of the house.
0,i have bought at least 6 people this kindle it is perfect......
1,"I give away these tablets at events. They are well priced, hard to break and efficient tablets. A great buy for the money."
1,"Bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it, it's perfect for her and if it breaks it wasn't an expensive device! Well worth it"
1,"This is a pretty easy, comfortable fit for my grandson."
1,This is good tablet for price of $49.99. The camera is not really bad. One reason why i dont't like Amazon tablet and cellpone is you can't download some apps like magic jack and chikka apps. I like this 2 apps because im using it international.
1,Another great Amazon product. Simple tablet that does what I need it to.
1,"I wanted a kindle that I could use to view movies on when traveling, and this item was the perfect choice. It's my go-to device!"
1,Looking forward to using my updated Kindle at Christmas.
1,Purchased as a a present. Girlfriend loves it. Would suggest buying for yourself or a loved one
1,One of the best streaming devices for the price. Bonus points if you are a Prime member or invested in Amazon's infrastructure.
1,This is a very good basic tablet. The resolution is excellent and is great for reading or surfing the Internet. The only annoyance is the adds that pop up on the home screen.
1,Fun to play with >iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
1,"I went to Best Buy to purchase a fire stick, but they were out of stock in the area. When I asked about the fire stick, the sales person mentioned how the fire tv might be a better option due to faster streaming and video quality. I am a fan of apple products and have the new apple tv, this system is much faster than apple tv with very little buffering while streaming. I have basic cable and my son can play video games and we can also stream to the fire tv. This is an amazing product."
1,I love the paperwhite. I had one of the first versions of the kindle that had the keyboard and loved it. Only downfall was it was not backlit. The paperwhite is and it is awesome!
1,"The tablet works great, we have several versions of the Kindle, Fire tablets and have never been disappointed. This one is also great, and the price was perfect."
1,"The Kindle Fire HD8 6th Generation is Wonderful! My old, old, old one was the 7"" screen which was fine, but the 8"" is even nicer. It still fits easily in my purse to take along with me. It's great having the camera which takes nice pics. I haven't tried the ""Alexa"" feature yet, so can't say much about that. The blue shade feature is wonderful for night time reading in bed. With my old one, even on the lowest setting, it would still disturb my husband sometimes. The blue shade provides a soft, gentle color that is easy to read and easy on your eyes. Using the internet is much quicker and smoother on this version as well. It's just better suited to it than my older version was. My only complaint is that the choices for cases are much more limited than cases for the older versions. After lots of searching, I found one on Amazon that I really like, but didn't have much choice in designs/colors.Overall I LOVE my Kindle!"
1,The Bluetooth speaker is nice very loud and I love how it connects to my Hue! Which makes controlling my lights so simple and being able to listen to radio stations such as IHeartradio.
0,i really like shopping at best buy in avon indiana
1,Very easy to setup and I love the colored screen. Great for reading books or just surfing the web. You will not be disappointed.
1,So fun to be able to ask Alexa how to spell a word or what is the weather. Also let her pick out music while I am busy doing housecleaning. I am continually amazed at the things she will do. Even set up an exercise program!
1,I purchased this to use Playstation Vue and it seems to be working well. I also use if for Youtube and Netflix. Quite a few reviews commented on the remote losing connection with the main unit but I have not had that problem.
1,"I love this tablet, The internet on it is so fast. It is really easy to use."
1,great purchase. it does everything as expected. very easy to setup.
1,Love love it .works for me it's my best friend in my head.
1,We have so much fun with the speaker. Can ask her anything
1,Faster and good quality for this kind of brand ...
1,it was easy to hook up . there is a learning curve as in how to ask it questions
0,"No the best tabler, is loaded with bloatware from amazon."
1,4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
1,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
1,Outstanding! We Love everything about it and look forward to what comes next!
1,"Alexa is awesome! My kids love asking her questions and to play their favorite songs , super quick responses too"
1,I bought this for my parents for Christmas and so far it does not disappoint. the ease of use and the selections are amazing. if you have amazon prime it links up even better and gives you access to all the videos and things it offers! great product.

1,Great tablet for the price. I enjoy the ability to seperate my log in account from my kid's account.
1,"This Amazon Fire TV box and remote is a great option to save money, and eliminate long term cable subscriptions. I should have purchased this years ago..."
1,Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
1,Needs to have higher internal memory to be better.
1,I purchased this as a gift. It was just what he expected. He is still learning all about it.
1,"I was looking for an inexpensive tablet that would be fast, cheap, and do simple things as reading, internet, and music. So far it's been great and on top of it Amazon released an update that adds Alexa to the tablet, so now you can ask questions to it, do notes, ask her to order you items, and also get her to play music from Pandora, Spotify, etc. Great buy!"
1,Usually use fire tv stick but got this one for 4K and faster speeds and it does not disappoint
1,"very easy to use,and also easy to handle, portable,with a news app. very informative! I would raccomend this tablet to anyone that craves portability. great also for prime members."
1,Love for old programs or programs I have missed and navigation through some very interesting programs that are not on regular tv on pay per view
1,"Not a whole lot to say. It does what I wanted it to do and works well with my Prime subscription. Love technology and I also own Apple TV. I prefer Apple products as a whole, but this does well also. If you have Amazon Prime and no preference towards Apple products I prefer the Fire Tv over Roku."
1,They love themOne of the best gifts they have received from usWe are going to purchase for ourselves
1,"We bought this as a birthday present for my 8 year old. It has almost everything she wants on it. Only problem is Amazon's app options are limited compared to Apple or Google Play. Other than that, she loves it."
1,"This was my second purchase of this style and brand of tablet.My first one unfortunately met with a accident,and needed replaced.This tablet has front and rear facing cameras,addable storage,and extreme ease of accessability.Love it."
1,I always finding what I need and better customer service at the Best Buy
1,Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
1,Love this product works great so far i would recommend this to others
1,"Excellent, I love it!! High quality, very responsive."
1,The perfect e-reader quite simply. Does exactly what you need it to do.
1,i loved it and it works well if you have a kodi installed.
1,Loving the new paper white Kindle with its no glare screen. It really is like reading a real book. The font and variety of sizes is very helpful. Both my husband and I use it with no issues at all.
1,Fun for the kids to ask it questions. Their having fun with it.
1,This item is great! It is better than the android boxes online.
1,"This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged."
1,"Bought this for a bedroom TV. The interface is geared toward Amazon Prime members, so most of the items on the main screen are of no use to me. You must do some scrolling to get to the APPS page. So for people who aren't Prime members it's not as convenient as other streaming devices. My solution was to install Firestarter.I would have bought a Roku, but Amazon Fire is the only streaming device to support the TIVO app. So unless I wanted to spend quite a bit more for a Tivo Mini + Roku, this was my only choice. But after installing Firestarter, I'm satisfied. The Tivo app does not do everything a Tivo Mini does, it just allows us to watch recordings from our Tivo Bolt in the living room.Had it come stock with a display option to switch to a less prime-specific startup screen, i would have given it 5 stars. But Amazon is trying to promote Prime, so that's not going to happen."
1,"For the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the Kindle Fire. It's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into Amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the Kindle Fire is a good choice."
1,I purchased three of these Tablets for gifts for three young children. Should have bought one for myself. Grafics are more than I could have imagined.Great for learning and playing games!!
1,This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.
1,I would highly recommend this product too anyone ! 5 STARS !!!!!
1,I love this product the many options and features it has is cool. My favorite is how loud the volume is and how clear the music sounds when playing it. We use it everyday
1,"Now with multiroom syncing available, I love it even more."
1,"agood buy for starters, recomend to other buyers to"
1,Two of the best features are the small profile of this eReader and the ability to read it in bright sunlight. It is easy to carry and is ideal for outdoor/beach reading.
1,Great deal for a handy tablet. I have no complaints.
1,Very durable and easy for my 5yr old to use. The price was just a plus.
1,"a great deal for a good product. very compact yet easy to view screen, and user friendly."
1,I have had my Paperwhite for a little over a month and I am in love! The software is much improved from the 2013 version which I previously owned. It is easy to navigate and pairs seamlessly with the app in my phone. You won't be sorry if this is the reader you choose!
1,Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
1,"After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use."
1,"There are cheaper Kindles and (considerably) more expensive ones, but this model hits the sweet spot. It has sufficiently high resolution to make reading comfortable, a good backlight, and is comfortable in the hand."
1,I ordered this for a person that has very limited use of his hands and this voice activated device has made a huge difference in his life. Had Geek squad set up with the Harmony Home Companion and now he can adjust and change the TV channels without assistance. Made a huge difference in his life.
1,Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!
1,Great tablet for a very small price. Would buy again.
1,"This tv box works great!!! Easy to play, and good quality"
1,Easy to use and the kid friendly protector works great...
1,"Nice little tablet for reading, Netflix takes a while to load if you want to watch it on it"
1,"Alexa was a gift to a friend while I was traveling to Dubai. They popped in their suitcase to take to their home in Thailand and have been raving ever since. And Cara in the Boston, South Bay location was the BEST BEST BUY gal EVER!"
1,"I was a little upset at first after purchase seeing that I pretty much need to be an Amazon prime member to get the full benefits of Amazon tv. On the other hand, It's way cheaper than having to pay a cable bill in the long run!"
1,much easier to see games than iphone and to read:)
1,"i love this kindle! I got the one with the backlight because it helps if you want to read at night! I got this specific kindle because I knew I would only be using it to read books & I didn't need the newer ones that you can get online & do much more (I have a phone & computer for that). I also love the look of this kindle, the screen is made to be glare free if you're reading outside in the sun and I love that! Definitely recommend this kindle to anyone!"
1,"Not too expensive and the kids have their own tablet to do stuff they want to do, just use the parental controls. The quality is pretty good too!"
1,She worked perfectly and helps out around the house hands free
1,Great little box that does cut the cable streaming. Almost all of those services are on the box and seem to work fine on it.
1,Great entry level tablet for kids without the worries of easy breakage.
1,"I love reading & I have thought about getting an e-reader for a while now. The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight, has adjustable lighting, is easy to read inside & outside, & the text is adjustable for both size & type. Holds a charge for days, even when used for hours at a time. Amazon has thousands of books for Kindle, many deals/discounts & even has books that are free. Well worth purchasing if you love to read."
1,"I love my new kindle! Purchased on sale for $39.99 which was a great value. Light, compact & super easy to use. A big plus for me was that with this version you can add more memory."
1,Nice option for an E reader. Bought mine on sale so couldn't beat the price. Not a high end tablet but does the job.
1,They are making updates to the unit but its currently in a good spot. The main issue currently is you cant hear netflix surround mode without cracking. You must change the audio settings in Netflix to stereo mode. Amazon is aware and they should fix it by the end of the November. Scrolling through the menus is quick. I bought 3 total as I have cut the cable at my house. I bought an OFF-Air Antenna and placed it inside ht my attic. I used Sling ($20.00) a month and you get the main channels we watched . (CNN /A&E/History/TNT and others) and Netflix. If your a Prime member you get more movies to watch also.
1,It is a great product would buy another one soon .
1,Other family member want same product...............
0,Barely 4k content and it lags a lot. Not worth it. Returned!
1,I have purchased the cheaper tablets. They never last. I purchased this for my brother who is never in one place long. He is able to stay connected and enjoys carrying this tablet everywhere.
1,The picture quality is great. It's easy to use and great for my home.
1,"Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet."
1,We love the Fire TV! We dropped cable and are using the Fire Tv with several great apps.
1,Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it
1,Works great for educational games and videos for my 4 & 7yr old
1,This tablet is a great starter for a low cost!!!!!
1,I bought this tablet for one reason and it has accomplished that perfectly. To stop my 8 year from nagging me everyday that he wants a tablet. I haven't had to hear those words once in two weeks after months of nagging me. Had I know I could get him a cheap one instead of an iPad I would have taken care of this a Long long time ago. 53 stars in my books.
1,"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
1,This replaces my old Kindle and works just as well only it is easier to carry
1,This is a very very good product. I would recommend this to anyone.
1,Allows me to decide if I want to stop using TV providers
1,Got this for my mom. She likes it. Thumbs up on this one.
1,I have really enjoyed by Amazon Fire. It does everything I need and is small enough for my purse.
1,Awesome device for home automation. Great for quick info queries. I added 2 smart outlets very easily.
1,Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. She is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.
1,"I like this Tablet for it's size, it's easy to hold on to when reading. I can put this in my bag when travelling and it doesn't weigh much...I also love the fact that I can expand the memory, whereas the other one I have 8.9 inch doesn't have that capability...The Camera works great...The only problem I have is trying to turn it off it doesn't always want to turn off...other than that I love this Tablet..."
0,I bought this tablet because of the price and the specs seemed fine but it is slow it freezes and crashes I dont think it was a good buy
1,Great device. Travels well. Easy to navigate. Would recommend.
1,"I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the ""official"" cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing)."
1,I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.
1,Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it
0,This doesn't power anything. I got this for my dad for Christmas and we just thought his Kindle was bad..nope..tried it on other things and it won't charge anything...I want my money back or a replace meant...maybe this unit is just bad! But 20 bucks down the drain!
1,"I bought this because we wanted to ""Cut the Cord"" and not having any real knowledge of how these things worked, i bought this and played with it for a while and now i could not live without it. The only limitations i have found are the companies (Networks) that do not have apps. I would recommend this to anyone looking to ""Cut the Cord""."
1,I was surprised at every thing this little fire stick could do!
1,This is a great device. Sometimes not as fast as I feel it should be
1,It is pretty good for the price. Good for a young teen or someone who does light web browsing or plays light games.
1,"Great to watch movies, TV shows on Netflix, Amazon & Kodi."
1,Love this gift for my dad he couldn't get it charged fast enough to play his poker games! Great price & so worth his smile on his face!
0,"I got this so my son would have something to watch movies on while on a long car trip. It does that, barely. The $50 I spent for it was worth it. If you get an SD card for it you can load and watch movies. The Wi-Fi sucks and it sometimes doesn't stream movies from Netflix. Forget about YouTube."
1,The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
1,Got my 6 year old his own tablet for christmas. Easy to use nice size . The reviews made me think twice but got it anyways glad i did take the chance
1,My son brought me the Echo for my birthday and I absolutely love it. Would recommend this product to everyone
1,"I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge."
1,Amazon likes to push their content and this tablet shows that. A good amount of ads distract users at time. But overall a good tablet for a child to get entertained with.
1,This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends.
1,Bought this as a surprise gift and the recipient loves it!
1,It helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like .
1,Excellent product that does what it is built to do and that shows great movies. Purchase this product Roku and this is a much better product. Love that I can watch other streaming apps as well on this device.
1,I love my Kindle. Wish it had more memory but overall it's the best electronic thing I have purchased for myself.
1,"I like to read before sleep to help me wind down from busy days, I love being able to quickly download books and take them with me wherever I go also. I use this Kindle to play games sometimes also, but it's a bit slow for that at times. Perfect eReader though, and a great price!"
1,"Amazon Fire Tablet: Catch up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments or chat with friends."
1,Do not turn cable off. Using with cable service...
0,"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
1,Easy to read in daylight and optional backlight makes this a great device. I miss the side buttons of the older version and it could be easier to tap the screen with the left hand to advance the page.
1,I got it just for reading text books...great for readin
1,I love it. Especially for the price................
1,I like the kindle 8 very much. I enjoy all the additional options it provides as well as the ease of using it. It will provide me with ability to be in contact with family and friends while on vacation.
1,"Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework"
1,"A wonderful tablet for kids, and an excellent price point for grandma! He's very happy."
0,"After purchasing 4 Amazon Fire tablets i immediately noticed the amount of advertisement they came with at the pricing of the tablet that I bought. There's always some kind of advertisement on the screen when it wakes up. My other issue is after adding a card to make a few purchases for some apps for my kids. I removed the ability to make purchases without a password, well that did not actually happen. For a few days my children were able to make purchases in apps without any props that said; are you sure or asking for a password. I've had to completely remove the accounts and reinstall a different account for them to be able to stop making purchases. I also had them transfer the purchases to the new email a big hassle. Overall the tablet works good great for the kids."
1,"The Echo has been a great Christmas gift, love the music, news, weather - super easy setup and it just works right out of the box."
0,"I have owned a few tablets and currently own an iPad and iPhone. I'm invested in the Amazon ecosystem via Kindle e-readers and Fire TV's. This tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but it's heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the Google Play store as the Amazon App Store is missing a huge number of ""every day apps"". It's a great extension for Fire TV's and it's certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who don't have an Apple budget. Personally I still find myself reaching for the iPad."
1,Purchased as a gift and person that received was happy and excited!
1,"I'm surprised how great this tablet is because of how affordable it was. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because how to navigate it is a little confusing, other than that, love it."
1,The hardest part is learning how to download the books.
1,I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact.
1,"We've bought two now and this version is a little lighter w/larger screen and just like our first one, really simple to use. We call them our tablets. They're super afordable and worth the $. Our first one was double the price so couldn't pass up this deal. It still works great and has been dropped many times by my toddler. Has all the same features as the child version I think. Great product!!"
1,Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!
1,I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift. It is a great tablet for a great price!
1,Great product. Provides quick responses. Works with other smart devices like lights and speakers for a seamless voice control experience.
1,Have a Fire stick tv in tvs and upgraded to Fire box tv. Much faster and expandable memory with micro SD slot. Also can direct connect with Ethernet cable.
1,"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
1,We don't have cable at our home... We use this and it's great and saves us lots of money.
1,I am very pleased with this product. I am able to play radio stations from across the country
1,"Great tablet for the kids, and very reasonable price"
1,"I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for."
1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Great tablet for the price!
1,great for teen agers and easy to use and set up small enough to take as you travel lots off apps to choose from long battery life as well would buy again and would reckomend this to every one even at a great price as well
1,Nice to read books and play games only down side is battery only holds charge for 8 hours unlike the smaller ones that last longer
1,Have this set up in the living room. Make sure to mute it when you're watching Youtube videos or stuff will start happening...and you'll run out screaming...which I've found can be very embarrassing.
1,"Good little tablet for what I wanted, a few games, reading, web browsing. Came to me with slight flaw in corner of screen where there is a spot that looks brighter than the rest of the screen but can't beat the price I got on sale $30!."
1,This tablet was for my great-grandson and he loved it
1,Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use
1,"Very easy to setup, internet reception is good using wired connection, 4K capable but 1080P is satisfactory."
1,Works well and looks great for kids. Limited internet access though.
1,"Echo is great works well no problems, best with amazon prime"
1,Replaced an Apple TV with this unit. Far better in speed and flexibilityMore apps and better content
0,Was unable to get to google docs on this one even though the sales person said we would be able to. My Granddaughter needed this for school & it did not allow you to get to google docs.
1,I saw one of these before for myself and this is now great for my daughter.
1,Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!
1,Bought this for our grandson and it was a hit and easy to use!
1,Got this for my grandson who cannot put it down. So nice to give a gift that is truly enjoyed!
1,The quality of the display is amazing - the battery life is fantastic
1,Very easy to use. price is great . Very fast . My grandkids use it by them self. Videos look very good
1,"Work perfectly for as a small tablet for checking Facebook and playting games. The screen is so much larger than the phone for easier viewing. It's nice that it can take pictures, but the quality is not up to most phones."
1,I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
1,"The Echo overall works good, still needs an update for voice reconitiona and giving directions."
1,"Improved features and design, crystal clear high resolution screen, and amazing battery life makes this not only a must-own Amazon device, but as a dedicated e-reader. Easy to use for all age groups."
1,Alexa works very well and will connect to many of your automated home systems. There's a great amount of freestanding applications as well.
0,"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
1,This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
1,"The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!"
1,I purchased two of these tablets and very satisfied with the quality.
1,"I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
1,Grandkids loved the tablets and they seem very durable and long-lasting
1,It is easy to see and adjust font style and size. Great for reading at night.
1,"I first saw the Echo at a friend's home. I bought one the next day on sale at Best Buy. This item not only plays any music I want to hear, but has many uses from locking my doors to controlling my home's temperature. Great item."
1,Tap makes a great mobile Alexa device. Not as loud as Echo but still louder than the Dot. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. As a mobile Bluetooth speaker though it works fine.
1,"Nice buy, great resolution I dimmed lightingWeight is good too"
1,"I used some giftcards received from another purchase, so my cost was only $20. I had to exchange my first one due to some dead pixels on the screen. But it does what I need, only wish Amazon allowed the Google play store."
1,My mom was looking for a affordable tablet. I bought mine at best buy last November. I recommended the fire tablet and she loves it.
1,Works very well! Love my kindle!
1,Bought this for my wife for Christmas after reading the reviews. Hands down the best e-reader for the price.
1,This tablet is a great tablet for the average user. It has decent sound quality and works great as a reader
1,Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
1,The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
1,"Had the Fire Stick before this and liked it, but felt load times were a little slow due to less ram and a worse processor. This FireTV is excellent! Load times are extraordinarily and it is lightning fast. Would recommend this to everyone."
1,I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
1,I read a lot so I wanted a light weight device. It's user friendly. You can adjust the brightness of light and turn pages easily. It fits nicely in my bag. I take it everywhere. I highly recommend it!
1,I like the light weight and enjoy reading out side again
1,This is an easy to use box. Voice control is a nice bonus!
1,I like my new tablet it's good on battery life and have fast response time when typing
1,"Started with appleTV. Traded those in for Roku, wasn't happy and switched to Amazon Fire Tv. Couldn't be happier."
1,"Great product, easy to use and readAnd the warranty taken makes it worry free"
1,"Amazon Fire TV is quick and easy to use, believe it has enhanced both the video and audio. It is a perfect combination with Amazon Prime. Received professional advice from Best Buy Associate, thanks!"
1,Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
1,We use three in our house and I've bought a half dozen as gifts. I'm planning a roadtrip across the country and Alexa has given me complete weather for each stop
0,"Got the nieces, wife, and myself these for Christmas. Figures they were cheap enough, so why not.These are functional tablets in every way. We haven't found any problem with them. The display isn't a hi resolution, so I wasn't expecting great. I've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. They are OK for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. This one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and I, though.If you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be OK with this.If you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet."
1,Good brand awesome use for home entertainment or out and about
1,"I purchased the kindle out of sadness at first to conform to the non book life, but can honestly say I'm glad I did. My book reading has gone up 80% easily and this compact guy has made all the difference. Easy to use, easy to store, light to hold, doesn't bother my eyes, just magnificent. I would suggest this to anyone, I found the back light better on the eyes than the paperwhite and the battery is great."
1,"My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight."
1,"I am able to adjust the font size for easier reading. The size of the unit is small enough to fit in a pocket, and makes it more portable than other readers. It holds a charge for a much longer time than another reader, from another company does, which I appreciate. I hate starting to read, and find out the battery has run low and I have to stop to charge."
1,"It is exactly what I needed! A plain ol' reader! No color, no apps! Just books, and I can read outside!"
1,"Alexa works very good , controls my thermostat ,TV lights and even tells corney jokes"
1,Alexa doesn't always have the answer to a question I ask but she is a lot of fun to play with. She can be utilized for so many purposes from a timer to playing a specific song. Great fun for all ages!
1,Got this for our granddaughter to take on a spring break trip. She read the whole way. Wonderful.
1,"Without really knowing much about this product I purchased it at the recommendation from some of my friends. Brought it home and it was a very easy set up with any type of phone by downloading the echo app. Immediately I was amazed at the uses we came up with for Alexa! It plays what ever type or specific band/artist music you want, or weather, or tv schedule. I keep it in my kitchen most times. However the best part is putting it in the bedroom and having it play music and then telling it to turn off in however many minutes so that you can fall asleep. What a great gadget for every home."
1,The screen is glare free and easy to read in any light. I love this Kindle
1,Great for my 16 month old daughter!!! Great price!
1,It is nice to get information on the spot when needed.
1,Great streaming device based on Android which makes it somewhat customizable.
1,This little device is great. It has a quick set up and easy instructions
1,The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
1,I love this thing. Works great with wifi enabled smart home products.
1,Got an Echo for the house and love its functionality. Easy set up and easy to use. Looking to purchase a couple of dots for other areas in the house.
1,I had a firestick but broke it so I upgraded to the fire box. I love it
1,"This tablet is a great value for the price. You can have multiple accounts on the same tablet, and pick which apps are available on the account for your kid."
1,I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
1,I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She watches Netflix and YouTube everyday and has had no issues. I would recommend this product to anyone.
0,"The Echo is not very good at answering questions. It is good at playing music and telling you the weather. I'm sure it will get better, but it is more of an annoyance with a toddler in the house. It does tell cute jokes, but it says ""I'm sorry I can't find that answer"" more often than not. The sound is quite good from this model, and works well with Spotify."
1,Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..
1,"Compact, Fast, Reliable .... Very GoodI am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):"
1,"Great experience! Purchased online, pickup in store"
1,"This is a good e-reader, small to carry, easy to use."
1,"If you want a tablet but on a budget, go for this."
1,"I waited to buy this product, to see what the reviews would have to say over time. They were mostly upbeat, and I am an Amazon Prime member. So, I said, ""What the heck,"" and gave the Echo a shot. I am glad I did. I use it to listen to music and news intermittently throughout the night while sleeping. I enjoy the Sports Update and the Flash Briefing. I also like that I can simply ask to stream most any radio station, and listen to the latest episode of my favorite pod casts. Echo is very responsive to my voice commands. This product is easily worth every penny you spend on it."
1,easy to setup and use. with low cost subscriptions you can get great shows and movies
1,"very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
1,My grandbaby loves hers. We gave it as a Christmas present!
1,Purchased this for my 7 year old grandson. He loves it and easy to use.
1,This kids fire tablet is perfect for our 5 year old granddaughter. We downloaded some free and purchase kids apps. It give us a break as she's not always asking for our tablet. And we know the content on it is safe.
1,I recommend this product many movies and very clear.
1,Good for music and various information.Hoping the company continues to upgrade the technology so you can get directions and search for things on the internet.
1,"I truly love my echo, it is great addition to my home automation setup."
1,"I bought the Echo for my son and daughter-in-law and they loved it. After Christmas I decided to get one for me and the wife. I really didn't think I would like it, but it turned out to be my favorite new tech toy. I already had a Honeywell smart thermostat and quite a few WEMO light switches. Now instead of getting out my iPhone to turn on the light, or change the thermostat, I just say ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lights on"" or ""Alexa, turn the thermostat to 74 degrees"". Best tech toy of the year!"
1,"Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can."
1,The price was great and my kid love it. Just bought another as a gift.
0,Sometime it just stays in sleep mode and you have to restart it
1,"I had to buy this Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black, as the price was right.What a great device. I did not expect it to perform the way it has. I have streamed video, read books and installed a 64GB sdcard i had laying around. Great for travel, due to the price I really have not lost anything if it is lost or damaged."
1,"She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use."
0,"The one purchased at Best Buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up. It got worse, to occurring while using it. Amazon was contacted via Chat and determined something was wrong, and exchanged it. The replacement from Amazon is working, so for this I will mark, ""Yes"" to recommend it."
1,Great device. Works great and so far no issues. :)
1,This a great product to be used by the whole family.
1,I bought this for cousin. She is very happy with this small tablet.
1,"I am really pleased with my new Kindle, I had one of the oldest versions and was reluctant at first on getting this one, but oh boy, I hit the jackpot.if you have never owned a Kindle you will be really pleased on how easy on your eyesight this thing is compared to reading on a tablet.Battery life is amazing, I turned off wifi and got over 4 weeks of battery life by reading around 1 hour a day, I recharged it before it was completely depleted.The addition of backlight is actually cool, even reading before night it did not disrupt my sleep cycle.And you get all the goodies of Amazon backing up your digital content.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,"We are having so much fun with the Echo. Alexa plays our favorite music we've saved in our library…finds new songs, gives us news updates and weather reports. I know she does much more but we have not had the time to experiment…..The sound quality is great. After we bought ours, I bought a second one for a Christmas Gift."
1,Great integration with Harmony. Can buy stuff from Amazon before I forget. Great product.
1,"Alexa is great- Controls my home, Sings and gives me weather and traffic alerts finds my phone and my other great things"
1,My son loves his kindle. Great product for the money.
1,Works well. Nice to know I have additional chargers that are the same size. I'm really glad I bought the paperwhite kindle.
1,"We gave thi to our son who,is,in the military and he uses it all the time."
1,Very good product. Working perfectly. Nice design!
1,Nice tablet and very fast/capable. The storage options are way better than the previous models. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone in the market for one.
1,Love my Amazon echo. Works with my Wemo lights and nest thermostat. She also plays prime music.
1,This was for my grandson and he loved it especially because of alexis app
1,Alexa is great. Able to listen to xm radio no problem.
1,My daughter gave me an iPad for Christmas. Had kindle before old one had broken screen. Not repairable on my geek plan. Bought this one for self for Christmas. Don't need both.
1,the kindle is nice and well packaged. It delivered so fast!
1,It's a great tablet for beginners. It's not ran off gb. So my teen have to have wifi. No bill
0,"Works great until....... I had forgotten that Amazon fire did not come with Google Playstore. I looked up how to add Playstore to the 7"" Fire. There are many videos on YouTube that showed how to add Playstore to the fire. All seemed to add it OK but the loss performance of the Fire was noticeable. There were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. One example was Lifetime. It was slow to load and failed to bring up Chromecast. One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet. It is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt Playstore. If Playstore isn't critical, then I'm sure this a a great little table."
1,I purchased this TAB as a gift for a family member. They are very happy with this product and it's features. The applications that come with this product are great. Happy to be a part of the amazon fire family.
1,I like this better than Apple TV. Easy to maneuver.
1,"I've been rockin' one iPad or another since Apple launched them in 2010, and never saw the need for a dedicated reading device like the Kindle. That said, I picked one up on a whim during Black Friday and I finally understand what the fuss is about. The text customization options make it easy to design/find the perfect reading experience, and the fact that I can send Instapaper articles to my Kindle from all my other devices is awesome. The fact that the screen is lit from the edges (as opposed to a backlight) makes it noticeably less draining on the eyes.Only downside is the fact that Amazon makes you spend $20 to get rid of those pesky special offers (which force you to swipe the screen to dismiss them every time the device is turned on)."
1,"I bought this to put in my room to use with prime music. Works great, Alexa is way smarter than Siri. With the Alexa app or another echo device you can drop in and use as intercom."
1,Perfect for beginners or for anyone that wants great tablet at a great price although it's cheaper than when the original was released it still has the same greatness as it's predecessors for 1 forth of the price.
1,"Love using the Echo to add stuff to my wife and my shopping list, turning on and off lights in our house, and for getting some daily news read to us! Soon will be adding an EcoBee thermostat so we can voice-control that, too!"
1,I got this for my son. He is reading more now that he download the books to his tablet
1,"We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids."
1,Brought a Echo just to listen to music while i have my morning coffee in my study but find out it so much more absolutely love it sounds good amd its easy to start up
1,"HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU GOT HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE TO FIND OUT YOU FORGOT SOMETHING. THANKS TO ALEXA THAT DOESNT HAPPEN ANYMORE. NO PAPER LIST TO LOSE, NOT INTERUPTING WHAT YOUR DOING TO WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU NEED. JUST TELL ALEXA TO ADD IT TO YOUR LIST. NOT TO MENTION EVERYTHING ELSE SHE DOES."
1,I haven't used the product it was purchased as a gift
1,"I will use this on the plane to watch a movie or play some downloaded games. For the price on black Friday, you can't beat it."
1,I purchased for a 7 year old perfect buy. She loved it
1,I had a hard time finding a case for it at best buy
1,Works as expected. Great for watching tv without the need for cable or satellite
1,"I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
1,Bought it for hubby and he loves it. The micro SD slot for more download space is great for movies and games. It also allows him to remote him in to his computer when he is away from home with an app.
1,I love my new fire! Such a smooth running tablet. I can use audible as well on this and Netflix and fun games. Battery lasts long time as well.
1,Good product would recommend to buy it to family and friends.
1,Love the product! Want to purchase another for my mother.
1,I love my Echo; the technology is user friendly & helps with everyday items. It is great to check the weather with just a few voice commands or listen to my favorite radio station.
1,"I bought this as a gift for myself, and I love it!!!"
1,I was always an IPad person but after having this I'm fine with it. It's easy to use and inexpensive.
1,I bought the original kindle fire table. To get a newer one due such a great price is awesome!
1,Wish Alexa was smarter but this is a good touch to anyone's home entertainment system.
1,This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
1,It is a very convenient product for ebook reading. More sophisticated.
1,"I already have an ipad but never felt like it was made for reading so I checked this at the store and love how it made me feel. Feeling like reading a real book but you also have some features as it's an e-reader. Enjoy carrying it in backpack/purse, light weight with perfect small size."
1,"Well built. Great, especially if you add the Kodi app."
1,We are still getting used to remembering to use Echo. There are plenty of applications that we have yet to try! I love that Alexa plays music for my every mood! We're adding a second one upstairs!
1,Great for the kids to have and play games on. They want put it down.
1,"Great for reading any book, light weight, easy to use best Kindle on the market."
1,This is your basic Amazon taplet. Nothing too special about it.
1,My kids love it & I like it 2 tanks and is really easy to use great product..
1,Bought this for my 3 yr old niece and she can't get enough of it.
1,The Amazon fire tv work well and fast downloads many movies to watch
1,"Echo is terrific! Can get quick weather reports, traffic reports, and answers to a lot of questions. Alexa even lightens up your day and mood with jokes!"
1,Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
1,"It took me a little time to get used to thinking of asking Alexa, but now it comes easily!"
1,"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
1,I got this kindle after the kids had been at their grandma's around tons of iPads. They were just as happy with these...
1,"Great little tablet, good price and charge lasts for at least about 6 hours or longer."
1,"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
1,"Perfect for carrying around with you carefree, for everyday tasks like email, Facebook, reading, news etc you can't beat it"
1,"We bought a second one for my mom. (The kids couldn't keep her off of theirs) Great speaker quality, customizable (we all can listen to our favorite music), fun/helpful features with Alexa, easy to use. Looking forward to using some smart features to help my mom even more."
1,"This is my first time using a media streaming device and it seems to be very easy to use. You do have to purchase some premium content, but there is a lot of free content also."
1,Purchased these for my boys (7 & 10) to read/listen to books and work on educational apps. Compact and great for use during traveling and away from home. Like the parental options to restrict use during designated hrs.
0,"As a charger, it works but is nothing special. With a Mk 1 Kindle Fire, it doesn't seem to charge any faster than the standard charger. And NO CABLE is included!! A Kindle-specific cable must be purchased separately! This is not mentioned in the descriptions."
1,What great interactive features...understands commands very well except when music is loud. Why not add a digital or analog output so it can be used in conjunction with your home audio as well?
1,Works great and enjoy using it. No problems yet. Might get another one soon.
1,"This is a good little tablet that takes a mini memory card. It is a little slow to load at start up, but otherwise is very handy and fast. Light weight and good for travel. At this price point ($50), I would not hesitate to recommend it."
1,This is my 2nd Alexa in the house. Love the speaker on the bigger one. the Dot speaker is pretty lousy.
1,"Don't know why I waited so long to ""CUT THE CORD"" and with AmazonProducts like these it's definitely a ""NO BRAINER""."
1,Good to read on wish it was a larger screen reads just like a book no color just black and white easy to hook up and operate easy the eye
1,bought the original when it first came -- never a problem original battery - thought it was time to upgrade -
1,"If you have Amazon Prime this is a no brainer. I have a 2014 Samsung smart TV and this works much better for streaming. It has wireless AC as well as N and connected to my AC network without any problems. It can also be hardwired to your router if needed. I really like the HDMI out which I can feed through my AVR the out to the TV just like a blu ray player. Connection was as simple as plugging it in and connecting an HDMI cable to my AVR. 4K streaming is glitch free and the voice remote works very well, too. Easily worth the 99 bucks."
1,I bought this initially as an alarm clock. I have now loaded it with a lot of skills. I am enjoying using it for tasks and fun.
0,"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80"
0,"I bought this tablet to connect to my hdtv. After not being able to get it to connect, I called Amazon customer care who informed me that this model doesn't connect to the tv, but the previous model (4th generation) does and that I should purchase the Amazon fire stick. Why the newer model does less...who knows. If you want to watch movies just on the tablet then it's a great buy, but didn't work for my purposes."
1,I purchased this for my son's birthday.. he loved it..
1,This is s great product. We plan on expanding the smart home aspect.
1,"For the price, it is so worth it! We have about 6 devices on our wifi and this is the fastest one out of the bunch! Lightning speeds and no wait time to download anything. You get movies, tv shows, music, NETFLIX!...Get Amazon prime too! So worth it!"
1,It is a good kindle for the money. to much junk on the carousel
1,This is a good little device. Well worth the money. Facebook is hard to read but overall a good product.
1,Fire tv works really well. It was easy to set up. No problems at all.
1,"I purchased this for my youngest grandson, age 4 for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly. Games have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he opens his gift."
1,"can't go wrong with it, my first ever tablet, it's worth the price"
1,I don't know why i waited to long to get this product especially since i have amazon prime. Gives me instant access to prime movies and has built in alexa what more can you ask for. Simply great .
1,Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.
1,This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
1,I have two of these. You can not beat the price and it's just as good as the really expensive ones! I love that you can expand the storage space as well!
0,Is a god but i have to pay 100 dollar a year is to bad
1,We are having a great time with it and very helpful to turn lights on as I am coming home so the house has lights on when I come in
0,It's a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget. My opinion was it wasn't worth the money. Computers and smart phones do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget. It might be more worthwhile for someone that wants to use it for running smart gadgets around the house. Not for me so I returned it.
1,This is a great product. Great tv and awesome for family content.
1,"This is a great smart device for listening to music, news or just finding fun facts. There's so much that Alexa does to make life easier. It takes some time to get all of your presences set up but it's worth the effort. We are so impressed with what Alexa can do that we decided to get some of the security tools to pair with it."
1,I bought themail kindle for my daughter to use at school. It was very convenient for her. She was able to do her assignmentshe off of it.
1,"Lights, timers, grocery's, Alexa, Echo's voice service does it all and more. Voice recognition is amazing, from across the room, when music is playing it works. Built in speakers are very good (on a Bluetooth speaker level). Setup is easy with the free App. select what ""skills"" you want to activate to customize Echo to your home, (skills are Alexa's ability's). More and more integration into home automation weekly, Alexa already controls select lights, switches, thermostats, even integration with some cars (start car remotely, how many miles remain before refueling). What could be easier then using voice commands that work and simply asking questions to get information?"
1,"I thought it would be a hassle to set up. It was easy. I thought it might feel creepy. I like her. I got it primarily for music. Know that if you purchase Amazon's Unlimited Music via Alexa, it's first month free, then 3.99 thereafter. You don't get that deal online. And you don't have to be a Prime member, which I find too expensive. I'm also thrilled that I can get my Pandora stations, which I think is not the case with Google's version. There are some things she doesn't understand but sometimes rewording helps. Several interesting skills to call upon. Fun. I like it."
1,"Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet"
1,It works good.my daughter uses it to read on and play games.
1,"Love the variety of programs, apps, etc. It was very easy to set up and start using."
1,Picked this up during Black Friday and for the price is a great starter tablet for my kids
1,Love Alexa. Dependent upon good wifi. When it works it is a great item.
1,"Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness."
1,It works well and is great for my daughter .I like how I can control how much she can use it
1,"This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!"
1,He loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.
1,Liked this so much also bought for Christmas 2 Echo DotsGreat Companion when you work from home
1,Had an earlier version of the kindle but found the paperwhite was much better - the ability to adjust the brightness of screen is a great feature - would recommend this to all - Even if you have a kindle
1,"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
1,I love this product. My kids love it. It is very to use and has a nice display.
1,"Got it for my granddaughter, she loves it, great for games and internet"
1,If you like to read and like to have more than one option then an e-reader is something to consider. I like the screen when reader as it is not glaring like a tablet or computer screen. The ability to adjust the font size is very beneficial for me. I also like being able to highlight words and get their definition. I am not a fan of all of the controls but once you get use to them the Kindle is very useful. I wish I could convert PDFs to the Kindle format a little better but that is not a fault of the device.
0,"My gift to my grandchildren they are on it 24/7 would recommend this, prices have gone down since I first bought my oldest granddaughter hers"
1,Does everything I wanted it to do with very few errors.
1,Go ahead and spend the extra for the FireTV. Worth every penny spent.
1,"bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use"
1,"I gave this as a christmas present, and they liked it."
1,"The paperwhite is wonderful. The functionality is great, battery life is awesome, and is so much better than trying to read a book on my phone. Recommend to anyone who loves to read, especially at night. Very easy on the eyes."
1,This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
1,"The echo has provided idea many hours of great music ,laughter and info."
1,This is my third paperwhite and sned it as a gift.
1,"Use it everyday for getting weather forecasts, laughing at jokes and so much more!"
1,"Bought this as a gift for someone skeptical to reading on a kindle, and they have really enjoyed it. Paperwhite makes it easy on the eyes and the opportunities for new reading material through Bookbub.com are a great match. Wasn't aware that it had the regular ads on the screensaver, but reluctantly paid the $20 to remove."
1,Very good but does not take all aps unless it is related to Amazon. I could not get all the aps I wanted. Good tablet for reading.
1,"i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
1,I have enjoyed using Kindles for about 8 years now. This particular one was purchased as a gift for another Kindle user and after looking at the one my Mom has thought this would be the perfect gift for my friend who is an avid reader. and the Black Friday Sale price was unbeatable!!!
1,"I got it for my 11 year old and she loves it. She can get email, help her with homework etc. The only downside is we can't figure out how to get Google apps."
1,"Purchased for household use, mainly for music streaming using Alexa App.THE PROS: Ordered online..easy. Received fast. Easy instructions & was hooked up in minutes. Wifi hookup easy too. Alexa app easy to work & figure out.Setting up with Pandora & Spotify for Music was easy too. ~so i bought a second Echo for another room.. I now have them in sinc to play music through the house. Voice recognition works well too. THE CONS: this uses a lot of data. If yours is unlimited..no problem. I don't use the Echo (Alexa) much during the week but play music for hours on weekends. I was on a 1GB plan prior to owning Echo.. now I have upped my plan to 6GB & may have to go a bit higher. ~just FYI.But still, no Regrets! ~Love it!!"
1,Very intuitive and convenient! Can ask anything and get reliable and fast responses!
1,I really like the Amazon Echo. My family loves asking questions and getting answers
1,"Definitely easy to use, easy to download books, and navigate pages."
1,"Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages."
1,"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight."
1,"I had to buy myself another of these 9W chargers because so many other USB chargers are relatively useless. I have chargers that won't even put out enough power to use the device while it is charging, and in fact, some devices discharge completely if you leave them on while they are charging.The 9W charger does a great job, and eventually, I might have a 9W charger both at my desk and near my bed.I highly recommend this product."
1,Very satisfied useful for internet and email. Will continue to use this brand.
1,I bought two Amazon Fire tablets for my two boys. They love it. It is so easy for them. Great for netflix and app games. And its fast.
1,Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.
1,"A must have, if you are a Prime Member. I love Alexa. Plus the kids love it too, they keep asking questions to Alexa."
1,Its a great tablet for the price. I bought one for my wife and one for my daughter.
1,"I bought this because I went Amazon Prime and even thought I had an HD TV, Xbox one, PS4 and even my computer i still had problems with Amazon video playing in HD. Magically after purchasing Fire TV the problems disappeared. Way to go Amazon! I bought this over the fire stick because I can add memory. It works great, and the new menu is easier to navigate. I'm not 100% on if it's worth it or not(prime and fire tv). It's like all these streaming services thousands of old videos many b movies that no one cared to watch when they came out. But as a product it works. It's easy to use. And if you like talking to your devices this will be fun for you."
1,This works great for voice control of my Samsung Smartthings for home automation.
1,"comfortable to hold while reading, not easy to rotate."
1,I went back and forth but this was the right call.
1,I bought this for my niece and she loves it. We take it everywhere.
1,Has great sound and base. Responds correctly to all my wuestions
1,"This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced."
1,My daughter loves it. She's a little rough with and throws it sometimes but it's still good. I did have a soft case on it though.
0,Took product back and was told that in order to get assistance the Geek squad would have to help me at my home and be charged for the service. I decided we didn't need the product that badly so took it back for a refund.
1,this product is very nice. I bought it as a birthday present and the person loves it
0,"Have not used for standard fire tv features. Bought to run kodi, which it works fine for. Freezes occasionally needing hard reboot. Worth the extra $ over doing kodi on streaming stick which lacks memory / cpu."
1,Great gift for my niece and you can't beat the price
1,"BEST BUY ALWAYS HAS AN AWESOME VARIETY OF GREAT MOVIES & PRODUCTS TO CHOOSE FROM & TO BUY. EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE BOUGHT FROM BEST BUY IS ALWAYS THE BEST & ALWAYS HAS SATISFIED ME, WITH NO COMPLAINTS. I USE TO HAVE AN IPAD & I SWITCHED TO THE KINDLE FIRE, BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER SCREEN & EASIER TO CARRY WITH ME & TO USE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE I GO...."
1,"The Echo is like the iPhone when it first came out. It is something you don't know you want/need until you get it and then you realize you can't live without it! Alexa is quite good at voice recognition and once you get it set up, you can: play music on demand, get weather, news and traffic info, order items on Amazon, control connected devices and much more. I am an Amazon Prime member and opted in to the Amazon Music service. What a treat to ask Alexa to play a specific song or only a certain type of music on demand. So much more I am still discovering. ""Alexa - Connect to Bluetooth"" is also great. The Echo is great sounding on it's own as well. Buy them on Sale and give them as gifts!"
1,Works like a charm responds very quickly! Just wish it didn't have to be plugged in all the time!
1,The tablet exceeded my expectations for $35. Kids love to play games on it and is great for social media.
1,"great response time, image quality is fantastic, easy to navigate"
1,I'm very happy with it. The sound is far superior than the Echo Dot. Really like the fact you can use it as an intercom if you have multiple Echos @ home.
1,This is a great and functional tablet for a low price.
1,Great when hacked with Kodi- especially with the Royalist!
1,"We already had an Alexa but this one is a great addition. It's portable, rechargeable and good sound."
1,"The Amazon fire TV is perfect for those looking to cut the cord. It can connect through wifi or through an ethernet cable, which works awesome and I don't get buffering. Plus 4k streaming, better processor and more memory is an upgrade compared to the Fire Stick. I ended up cancelling my DirectTV a while ago and haven't looked back. Compared to what I was paying with satellite subscription, this is very cheap. I already have Amazon Prime, so I get their streaming service and also have Netflix and Hulu. This is perfect for my family and my needs ."
1,Alexa works great. Very easy to use and speaker sounds awesome.
1,I wanted to cut the cord from satellite tv and search for a lower cost alternative. I LOVE the Amazon Fire TV. Easy to set up. Only disappointment is I can't watch all of the same programs/channels I did on satellite TV. I am saving $120/mo since I cut the cord!!
1,I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others
1,Bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it!
1,I purchased this as a gift for my mother. Her first tablet and she loves it. Easy for her to navigate.

1,"This tablet is amazing! Easy to use, great tablet to use for skyping. I don't have any trouble with this tablet when using it overseas, clear video call from here in states to overseas!"
1,"Decided to add another Echo to the household. With this purchase, I currently have 2 Echo's and 2 Dot's. Since this Echo price was $140, it swayed me to go this route instead of another Dot with a Bluetooth speaker. Now with the 'intercom' drop in feature, it expands our communication in the household."
1,Does exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend for an inexpensive travel reader.
0,Not the greatest for productivity but it's very good at entertaining kids at a cheap price.
1,Purchased two of these when they were on sale. One for myself and one for my sister. This device is awesome. I had the Hue lighting system prior to and had to have my IPhone or IPad around in order to control the lights. Now with Alexa I can let her handle that just by speaking to her. Now anyone in my ManCave can talk to her and control the lights as well as the music. Amazon Music Unlimited is just $3.99 with Alexa. Great deal. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
1,This is the essential tablet for reading an extensive library of books on the Amazon store.
1,"Alexa does everything promoted and more. A game changer for smart home control. I'm controlling lights, climate, Televisions and music. Pretty sweet!"
1,I am using it from Nov'15 and have lots of apps and games installed it just never gets hang or slow up.
1,I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it

1,"I am absolutely in love with my alexa echo, she is so easy to use and her voice recongination never gives me any trouble"
1,Got the echo and was so happy with it got the dot. Then moved up to the smart home bulbs and now Alexa turns on my lights. Moving to thermostat next
1,I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden
1,"This is an excellent product, and Bestbuy sold it with great condition."
1,it's a great tablet for the money. I would buy another.
1,Love this tablet for my kids! Great price and fits my 6 year old twins needs.
1,This is a nice tablet for children or beginners. Processing speed is adequate for playing games or watching videos.
1,"I love this 7"" tablet. I can carry it anywhere. It is very easy to use. The ads don't bother me at all. Very happy with it. The shipping was fast especially being around Christmas!"
1,"I purchased this for my mother as a gift because she was always watching me play games , surf the internet, check my email and message friends. She asked if the one she had could do all that and I new it wouldn't. She LOVES her new Fire."
1,The shopping list is a great feature but it could use some improvement like adding multiple lists. Music sounds good on it. The kid and her friends love playing with it.
1,"cool gizmo, definitely a great gift for the person that has everything!"
0,"I returned this product after deciding to standardize on one streaming technology. I chose Roku because of reputation, the Best Buy salesperson's recommendation, and the included headphones with Roku."
1,"Husband loved my KF so much I had to get one for him for X-mas. He kept ""borrowing"" mine! Easy to use, even most technically declined can handle."
1,I bought this as a gift and my nephew really enjoys it.
1,Exactly what I thought the amazon fire stick would be.
0,The tablet stop working after the second week. I couldnt find the receipt to return it. Its just beenCollecting dust
1,Awesome plus made it better by buying the battery!
1,"If you want to start using Kodi and don't want to spend $200+ on a Nvidia Shield and don't want the laggy performance of a Fire Stick, spend your money on the Fire TV BOX. Runs amazing!!!"
1,The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
1,This is a nice handy tablet. Performance is good for the money paid. Will recommend if you are not downloading too any things.
1,"The Amazon tablet series has come along way since it first came out. The screen on the Fire HD 10 is stunning. Clear and easy to read. If used to android apps though, may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet."
1,"I always buy iPads because I am an Apple fanboy, but these tablets (I bought several) have been great for the price and for what I want them for and that is to entertain kids at my business. These are much more affordable than iPads if your just playing games on them."
1,My daughter like the tablet and she use the tabet everday
1,"This is a Christmas gift so we haven't been able to fully review it but it was very simple to set up, add apps and games. I really like the parental controls!"
1,My daughter would not read before she got her kindle. She love this and now reads all the time. Books are cheaper and less space needed in your home. Great games.
1,"Very user friendly, amazing and interesting; you have all the help that you can get just by talking to alexa."
1,It was good. It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.It was good.
1,"I was skeptical, mainly due to the fact that I didn't think I would need it. We've only had it a day and I don't know what I would do without it. Alexa is very responsive and much more user-friendly than Siri. There's still more figuring out on my end, but the possibilities are endless."
1,High quality and very dependable. Very easy to set up.
1,Love the Kindle Paperwhite. So convenient to take everywhere. Especially to the beach!
1,Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
1,"Good Tablet for Kids, easy to operate and to handle."
1,I love this tablet. Its so simple and easy to use. Happy with how long the battery lasts after watching Amazon video for hours.
1,I picked up 3 units for Christmas gifts for my kids they loved them.
1,Great little reader! Easy to use and download books. The backlight helps in all lighting situations. Long battery life
1,Love the Fire - play games on it every day. It is small enough to carry with you but powerful enough to watch movies.
1,I've owned Android TV and Apple TV in the past and the fire TV beats them both. Speedy interface that plays 4k well. Definitely recommend!
1,Is good for the kids The only thing is I have to get a SD Card for more memory
1,"I love the new Amazon Fire TV. I have signed up my accounts to it and it makes watching movies and tv shows a lot easier. Instead of paying for cable and never watching half the channels, you can choose what apps are best for you and save money!!the only con i have is that its not as smooth as the apple tv but it does offer more apps"
1,"Alexa is very easy to use. I just plugged it in, downloaded the companion app, and was surprised how much it could do with a few voice commands. I highly recommend it for beginners in home automation devices. The more I use it, the more intuitive it becomes. I am going to purchase one for my 86 yr old mother too."
1,"This was a great purchase. I use it to order merchandise, play music, and answer questions."
0,Did not care for this product. Had difficulty downloading some Aps.
1,I got the tablet for my two year old son and he loves his tablet.
1,"Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but"
0,I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
1,Easy to use and read with good battery life. Highly recommend.
1,"I purchased this after trying the Insignia 8"" tablet which unfortunately had a charging problem. The graphics on this tablet are OK, though the contrast is not as good as the Insignia's or other more expensive tabs.Integration with Amazon for reading is excellent. Tablet is responsive and speedy. Construction is sturdy and heavier than the Insignia. The Silk browser runs well for all the sites I visit."
1,Bought for our 9 year old son for Christmas. First tablet. Usually just plays games/watches YouTube on my Galaxy phone. He hasn't had any complaints about this to date.
1,Great for a Beginner tablet bought this for my mother for Christmas and she loves it. Plays all the android games on it and runs no problem.
1,Amazon echo is a great speaker if you love techy things! It tells you the weather and whatever else you would like to do!
1,Love the music and the interaction. Also responds quickly. Very accurate information.
1,"Love everything about it. No complaints, Will recommend it to a friend."
1,Our first Kindle finally gave up the ghost after many years of use. Love this new Paperwhite. The front lit screen is great as my old Kindle required a case with a light in order to read in the dark.
1,This is a much faster and easy to use media player.
1,Great for doing the cord cutting. So far so good..
1,Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.
1,"Works great however , She is only as smart as you make her. A lot of work to be done !"
1,"I was using Chromecast but this is a far better delivery system as far as picture quality and reliability. Also more choices of programming, of course."
1,We wanted something you could read books on and watch shows through amazon and hulu. This meets those needs and then some.
1,Awesome little tablet for the price. Not an iPad but fine for just watching Netflix and other small tasks while on the go.
1,"The size is perfect, good resolution. Can be used for all purposes."
1,I like the device easy to use. It does the job. I can use a regular keyboard too
1,I vacation often and enjoy reading on the Kindle verses my tablets.
1,nice product with low price.i will recomend to my friends.working good.
1,"The Amazon Echo provides both a way to coordinate household appliances but also answers to b all your questions. Easy to use, maximum effectiveness. I discover new uses for my Echo every day. Coordinates tasks with my cellphone and allows for programming contingencies (if this, then that). I love it."
1,Every home needs one and very reasonable priced! Easy set up
1,Kids have only had for 3 days and love them. Screen doesn't seem to slide as well as other fire devices. But screen protector solved that anyway
1,My daughter loves this Echo. Lots of fun to play with and very helpful.
0,"Love my watch bumper, but the tablet is so slow wouldn't recommend"
1,My son is non stop on this tablet it's fast. He can look up anything on it and recoding video is clear. He loves it!
1,"This tablet is amazingly awesome. It looks like its price, cheap, $39 at #BestBuy but it does all that I need it to do which is streaming music and movies. You can setup multiple users including a child profile with parental control."
1,This thing is awesome! Makes life a little bit simpler
1,It's great for the price but always freezes and stalls maybe it's just nine since I put a 32gb memory card in there so it takes time to load. The price makes it worth it and the fact that you expand the memory to what you want
1,I need to set up the app so I can have more options
1,Bought it to use with my WeMo devices and it works like a charm. Alexa is my new best friend!
0,Great tablet fast and great resolution. Great with prime membership
1,"Great entry level tablet for kids. Easy to use, easy to control!"
1,"After toying with purchasing an Echo for months, we finally pulled the trigger. It was well worth it. From recipes to simplifying a shopping list to music and news, it's a perfect supplement to our connected home. Alexa is much sharper than Siri. Highly recommended!"
1,"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
1,Great to give to the little ones so they don't break my phone. Found it at a great price and used rewards to bring the price down more.
1,I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.
1,I like the size and it's user friendly. I originally bought a tablet that was bigger but it stopped working less than a year and the size was too big and too heavy for my 7 year old. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
1,Easy to connect and set up. Provides access to a lot of media. Alexa works great!
1,"This Amazon Fire tablet is AMAZING. It's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. You get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed."
1,The Amazon Echo is amazing.....easy to set up and easy and affordable to use!! We bought one for us and one for my parents because it is so great!!!!
1,I purchased it for my nieceShe loves it and allows her to stream programs and play many games
1,"My wife uses this to read various newspapers. There's a problem occasionally with downloading the current issue. It's not a problem every day, just ever once in a while. Pleased with the device."
1,"Its lightweight, amazingly bright color display and the best thing of all is you are granted access to thousands of books that are free from amazon/"
1,The Fire 7 Tablet allows you to get a lot of free apps. It runs fast even with the amount of apps you have on there.
1,It keeps up with my Samsung Tab 4 I have no complainants at all..
1,"I purchased this laptop for my son and he was able to set it up himself. I recorded and helped him with passwords and documenting. Speed of the computer is average for basic web browsing and running programs. Memory seemed to hold its own and he was able to jump from different programs. With it being an i3 and basic memory, I explained to him how restarting it once a day would keep the speed up. He has enjoyed and used it on a daily basis with no issues."
1,"it's fun and easy to listen to music, get weather updates, etc.On the useful side it makes operating your lights, garage door, and other items in your household; working them is very convenient"
1,My son loves it stays on it all day wish the battery would last longer
1,I used it to watch movies when I was recently in the hospital. The picture was very clear.
1,Alexa is a great product and I would highly recommend this product.
1,6year old son loves it. It is dependable and economical in price. All features are easy to use and makes reading fun if your child is into reading books on te web.
1,I HAVE SEEN THIS DEVICE ADVERTISED . I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND AM SO GLAD I DID. .IT IS SO NEAT THE QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK IT AND IT COMES BACK WITH THE ANSWER IN 1 SECOND.. I ALSO LIKE PLAYING MUSIC THROUGH IT.
0,"I purchased this product during a recent sale. I am loving it. From streaming music to my phone, setting alarms, checking my schedule, and playing music. I also purchased some smart switches and am able to control several devices using my voice. Lately I have noticed that I am having to repeat the wake up phrase sometimes. However, this is not a big deal."
1,"So far the only complaint I have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. I had one for just about 2 weeks when I noticed a definite issue staying connected. My wife, who has had her Kindle Fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival. It does most of what I need (email, facebook, minimal web use), saving ""wear & tear"" on my laptop."
1,very user friendly along with very low monthly cost to gain access to Amazon catalogs
1,I have one but bought this for a gift. Best gift for a great price.
1,"This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
1,This was a gift for my granddaughter. She absolutely understand how to use the tablet and totally enjoys the product. Excellent charging time and last her all day. Best buy had the best price out of the 3 nearby stores. Staff was very friendly and efficient.
1,This is awesome and I love it. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family
1,Tons of things you can do with this. Highly recommend it.
1,Love this. Best purchase I have bought. Was very skeptical at first. But I use this for everything.
1,Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
1,It will be great if the screen is larger. Otherwise it is good.
1,"This kindle is a great buy, pretty simple to use, very convenient."
1,Great device to entertain the children while traveling
1,"great tablet to use around the house, and on the go . my wife like to read alot"
1,I was in need of a new Kindle. We were going on several trips and I needed it immediately . The person at Best Buy that helped me was excellent! He helped thru the entire setting up process. I walked out a very satisfied customer.
1,Amazing product I bought 2 one for me and wife we read alot of books so perfect and the selection is great books a must buy.
1,My kids really like this tablet. It's easy to use for them.
1,I mainly use it for streaming music but it's totally worth it.
1,Nice tablet for a very affordable price. I would recommend to anyone!
1,Yes It is a very nice starter tablet. I would think it will bring a lot enjoyment to the owners.
0,"We bought this for our 8 yr old daughter and it's great for most of what she does, but it is not good for playing a lot of games because it locks up sometimes or it runs a little slower. So if we had to do it again we'd probably buy something with a bigger processor."
1,"I really like the Paperwhite, it made me want to read books on my Kindle again. Try it if you hate it, return it, but get your hands on this for a while, and I'm convinced you will keep it."
1,This works fine. It's a tablet! It does things well!
1,"I brought two tablets for my grandchildren for learning and to keep them busy, and they love it!! So do I!!!"
1,The picture is great. The motion rate makes any old movie look new and amazing. Only downside is it takes a while for the app center to load and be ready.
0,"We cut our cable in hopes to just use this product. However, we cannot view most things without logging into a cable source. So now it just collects dust. I guess if it was ""jail broken"" it might be better."
1,"Amazon fire is almost relevant to a tablet, which holds ,post of the feature and respect to processor speed it more than the expectation to surf and listen music"
1,The light and white page allows me to read in bed without disturbing my spouse.
1,He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
1,can't say enough about this works awesome great price
1,"Great for browsing, streaming and everyday web usage"
0,The only bad thing is it doesn't have google on it
1,I bought two of these for Christmas presents. One for my grandson and one for my granddaughter. They both love them.
1,I got these during the holidays at an amazing deal. They turned out out to be a very good tablet for an unbelievably low price. It really saved me a lot of time and money. Best of all the product was solid.
1,"One of the easiest android tablets to learn it's functions! Great as a reading tool, but also for setting up email, web searches. Easy access to games and various apps. Nice to have access to a camera as well. A great tool for seniors with limited computer experience."
1,Overall a great sound from a small package. Price may be a little high for the money but other than that a great purchase.
1,This is the ideal tablet for my 8 year old son ##1
1,I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
1,My daughter is going to love this for christmas!!! Thanks best buy.
1,I really like it because i can watch a lot of movies
1,Easy to read and the books are easy to download and less expensive than paper books and save on the storage space that paper books require.
1,"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
1,Nothing fancy. A good budget tablet that does what It suppose to do
1,"Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own."
0,One of the worst purchases or investments you could make for technology.
1,Great product I bought 2 very fast hardly no lag..
1,"Amazon did it on this one. I love my Echo, from checking the weather to asking random questions. I plugged mine up at the store and played with it for 30 mins with other customers and employees. This thing is a must."
1,"This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."
1,This is my first tablet. It is simple to use and very efficient.The only thing that I would have liked would be larger keys on the key pad. Other than that I am very happy with it.
1,I've had the chromecast for years and never really had any problems with it besides the occasional freeze when casting videos too big.Decided it was time to upgrade since SlingTV had a $50 promotion off any SlingTV capable device. The decision was probably one of my best purchases of the year. Now I can watch 4k content and stream videos without any lag.
1,Great product. Books download fast. Great traveling companion.
1,Bought this for my wife who swore she would never give up paperback books. Now she uses this one all the time. It's the perfect size to fit in her purse for trips too.
1,"Works well from outdoors, to plane to reading in bed. No issues. Excellent all around. Better than a light."
1,I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
1,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!
0,"I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK."
1,"The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go."
1,Got the tablet for my grandma. She was able to figure it out and she doesn't even have a mobile phone. Not bad for under $40.
1,Wonderful educational tool for my niece with special needs.
1,Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them
1,"This tablet is great, nice size and functionality."
1,We are very happy with our purchase. We use Alexa everyday for various things and really enjoy playing jeorardy.
1,This is a great kindle for the youngers at a great price!
1,Works great also love how it it capable of more storage and child proof
1,The only con I see is the exclusion of the optical sound out put. The Micro SD slot is a nice addition.
1,The fire is a decent pad for basic uses. The only downside is the way the fire automatically links with your Amazon account. Also the ads are annoying and clearly designed to increase your Amazon purchases more than anything else.
1,Great tablet for someone to start out with. I've never personally owned a tablet before this but I have used other family members tablets. This one feels like it is missing something. Some of the apps do not work on it. I still enjoy it though.
1,Got it for the kids lounge to stream movies. Will get the gaming remote so the can play games.
1,"Great starter eReader, very simply does what it's made to do."
1,"Is nice for reading, sometimes the screen is a little slow. Hate the ads on the main screen"
1,My wife enjoys this product. Really likes the grocery list feature.
1,"I was NOT expecting this product to perform so well. Sleek design,compact, and easy installation make this product well worth the money. The only thing I was a little turned off by is that you cannot fully customize the wake name..yet..and you cannot connect it via Bluetooth to a soundbar/extra speaker. The overall performance of the sound that comes out of it is surprisingly great though. I just wanted more. I got over not being able to add more speakers pretty easily though. It's that good. I might suggest however adding a Harmony Home hub with it so you can REALLY take advantage of the voice features. It was my understanding that the echo can pair with the hub so you can control more items. I'm going to set that up today so it is NOT verified just yet."
1,Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.
1,You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
1,This is super simple to set up and use. The hardest part is using your tv provider info to gain access to some of the channels. This requires a bit of patience since you have to log in and enter codes and wait for emails to accomplish.
1,My kids have these and love them. I may have to get one for myself
1,Great tablet for a beginner to get used to the technology
1,This thing has it all...even the cartoons that my older kids watched. Plenty of activities and teaching. 5 stars
1,The Amazon fire tv is amazing. It's really snappy and works really well. I highly recommend it.
1,"This is a great tablet for kids. Keeps them busy with so much to do, watch, and create."
1,My 6 and 4 year old boys love it and so do the parents
1,"I upgraded to this from a Kindle Keyboard, so it was huge upgrade. Holds more books and has a back light. The light is fairly uniform but not so bright that it will bother the person next to you. Battery lasts a good long while and it is easy to read in direct sunlight too."
1,Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places.
1,Upgraded from dot to echo. Sound quality is great. So many things you can do with this gadget!
1,Fast fun tablet with great speakers compared to previous fire tablet. Worth the money
1,"I bought this for my 8 year old. I was a great buy. The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8"" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!!"
0,Most buyers will have a phone or other charger that will work so you probably don't need to buy this.
1,Bought as gift for an avid reader. He could get to the point of reading on a tablet. He has to have a real book. Works perfectly as described.
1,The Echo is interfaced to my home automation system which makes control of the house very easy.
1,"Alexa is great to use; her recognition is good, and if you have Spotify and Pandora accounts you can really get a lot out of it (and light / outlet kits: saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room"" feels exquisitely dorky). Plus, it's the only way to order the Dot, which is essentially the top of this speaker. After a week with the Echo, I purchased 2 Dots for other rooms. Again, to get the most out of this, you need to own Kindle Books, have a Spotify account, and preferably Audible / Unlimited."
1,I needed a 2nd tablet and this was a great purchase.
1,Overall a great tablet for the price. Able to use this for work and play
1,Hey--It works. I prefer to get a battery recharge direct from the source instead of from my computer. The cord is convenient.
1,Amazon tablets are the best android tablets available.
1,"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music."
1,Perfect for what I need. Quality product that I feel I can use for a while.
0,"Picked this up for a 7 year old. I'm used to using iPads, but not a bad little tablet for a kid and Im not worried if if something happens to it."
1,I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
1,I use this for videos the quality is great I use headsets the speaker is good for quiet places not to loud.
0,Bought this for myself at Christmas as a replacement for my older version. This one has clearer graphics but I find the build to be way cheaper and definitely a great deal thinner..felt to flimsy to me.
1,"Great price for a little powerhouse, tough tablet. This was given to my nephew (3 years old) and he is like a bull in a china shop but this little tablet has held up. It may not be the fastest or the best screen, but for small children or accident prone adults this is a great tablet. It does a lot, and Amazon controls for the younger set is quite powerful."
1,"Great tablet for the price. If you're looking for a cheap and easy to use tablet, this is the one."
1,Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it
1,Got this to replace my old 3G Kindle with Keyboard and it is great that I don't have to use a outside light to read after dark. Good job Amazon!
1,It's the best price media streaming tablet on the market. I watch everything on it.
1,"Overall, this is a decent tablet. Quite easy to set up. Takes a few minutes to run the updates, but you'll be up and running in 15 minutes or less,Build quality-- very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling. the back of the device is a plastic type material but overall nice."
1,"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
1,"Great device to go paperless and no more books. However, hard cover books are still fun to read."
1,Love this way more than the old fire stick...so glad I upgraded...It was easy to install and I'm once again enjoying my shows
1,"Bought it as a gift for someone that works at home, they love it. Very easy to setup, makes it easy for someone to listen to music (if you have an online service Pandora, Spotify etc). with out having to setup a Bluetooth connection to an external speaker. This makes it a joy for this person and she loves it. Lots of things you can do besides listen to music, set timers, ask questions: sports scores, weather, endless features and functions. Worth the money."
0,"Super Slow, Would not download, Returned after a week"
1,Sweet awesome.....................................
1,I love the size. Easy to carry. Just like every other Kindle as far as features.
1,"I purchased this Kindle for a friend. In fact, it's the third Kindle I have purchased for friends. It's light and can be used at the beach or in the dark. It's easy to use and worth the money."
1,More poeerfyul than the fire stick same idea just bigger stronger and fastet
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece. Very good price.
1,Every time I use the echo I find there is something else that it can do. There is not a day that I don't find use for it!
1,"Just what I needed, lightweight and easy to download books from the library"
1,My family and i have a great time with ECHO. it is easy enough for my 4 year old to use for whatever she wants. great product.
1,"I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
1,The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.
1,Bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband. So far he loves it. Our son has an Echo and hubby really likes it. Now to add accessories.
1,"This is a great low priced tablet, especiall if you are an Amazon Prime member."
1,To the best of my knowledge the Recipients enjoyed it
0,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
1,granddaughter loves it! Now my Ipad if free for ME to use
1,"This is great for kids. Don't necessarily need to buy the more expensive kids version for a protective bumper. You can get the same apps & a better price tag. Just watch the charger port, kids can bend it if not careful."
1,"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
1,Awesome products friendly staff would defiantly do business again
0,Good storage and camera for younger children. Could have better battery life.
1,Prime integration is smooth and voice recognition is much better than Siri
1,"It is fun and cute, but I wish that it would do more."
1,"Inexpensive tablet to read ebooks, check emails and watch videos."
1,The Amazon Fire TV is a superb streaming device! It is by far the best streaming device I have ever owned!
1,Excellent speaker. Can handle most requests for any song.
1,I switched to a Kindle because my second Nook died. The Kindle is very easy to use and extremely easy to read. There is virtually no eye strain even after many hours of reading. Also it is very sturdy.
1,"It began with one, now I have three. I need two more, but I think I will get dots. I want t try hooking it up to my Darth Vader Bluetooth helmet. That's going to be sweet. I wonder if I can rename this from Alexa to Darth? Get this, but realize you'll want many more."
1,"Great for streaming movies and amazon, easy set up! Would defiantly recommend this product."
1,"I got a great deal on this and bought it. It does the basics. No more. No less. The display is below average, at best. And the Amazon App Store is a bit clunky. But you get what you pay for and I'm satisfied."
1,Love it! Alexia is at your service. Love the ability to play a variety of music. Great product!
1,"This is an excellent streaming device. It has all kinds of apps and other apps that you can download and you can even hack it to put Kodi on it. What I really like about the Fire TV box, over the Fire Stick, is that this box has an ethernet port, so you can connect it to the Internet, through a hard line, for a more stable connection than wifi, which means just about no buffering/load times, depending on the speed of internet you have. With wifi, you will have some more buffering/load times because the signal can fluctuate and go in and out sometimes. With the ethernet connection, the signal stays pretty consistent. Definitely recommend this."
1,everything I was looking for and more. Clarity and brightness
1,Good product that does the basics. Too bad for the price and you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful.
1,i love these thing buy them for my friends all the time
1,It is amazing what this Echo can do! I would recommend this for anyone!
1,Bought this for my 11 year old. He loves it. Has access to the Amazon underground store so he can buy all the apps he wants. I've set controls so he can't accidentally buy something with real dollars. A great tablet - way beyond expectations for this price.
1,Purchased as a gift for 6yr old boy. He can now play all the games he wants without having to share with big brothers!!
1,It's like having a tablet with your own library right at your disposal
1,"Enjoying easy selection of music and exploring her sense of humor. Have had many good laughs, from interesting interactions. Talk to her daily and my wife does not mind!"
1,"good tablet for kids, basic functionality. not much memory"
1,So easy to use. Compact & easy to carry in my bag. Love it!
1,"Provided I use the correct cable, this will fast charge my wife's IDevices. Just what I needed as we have lost two Apple chargers."
1,"This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!"
0,Amazon adds are annoying. Lack of compatibility with Google and other apps is annoying. Price is great. Nice to have but it really isn't better than other tablets out there.
1,I love my new Kindle Paperwhite. I love the small size and the fact that is backlit.
1,This is the 2nd Echo for our household. We also have 2 Echo Dots for the kids. We all love them and use them throughout the house to stream music.
1,The navigation on the tablet is easy to use. Its great for streaming movies. light weight and compact.
1,I bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! I even use it too.
0,"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again"
1,My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
1,Love the movies and songs it is a great product. Tx
1,"I have no use for cable since purchasing this device. When used with subscriptions to amazon prime, sling, Hulu and Netflix, you forget you don't have cable. The stronger your wifi, the better your experience:"
1,I love this e-reader! It's even better as it has the background lighting so you can use it in dark areas
1,Does the job and does it well.
1,Very good tablet and easy to use. Its small a portable.
1,"This is awesome for reading. Much better to read than my iPad Mini 2. The refresh from page to page, or when you set a bookmark, is more annoying than using the Kindle app on the iPad Mini. But for reading books it is easy on my eyes and it can't be beat. I read in bed before going to sleep and I can fall asleep easier after using my Kindle than the iPad."
1,Great customer service at Best Buy I was able to navigate through the product before actually purchasing it I will def be back and highly recommend it
1,Love my first tablet and I have recommend this to my Mom. She bought one too!! Not as heavy as some other models. Perfect for playing games on and watching movies. In love...
1,Love it. Does the job. Works well bur not with the direct tv now app.
1,This kindle is fast and affordable. I highly recommend it.
1,Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
1,I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage.
1,"For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective."
1,"Excellent for timers, wake up alarms, reminders, adjusting the temperature on my echobee thermostat, control my lighting etc..."
0,The supplied Amazon Bluetooth remote control will not pair back with the main unit. This is the second one I bought with the same issue. Re-Pairing the remote is quite simple per the instructions but to no avail. Had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit. Going through batteries like crazy trying to get it to pair back up no more than three inches from main unit.
1,"Literally rocks! Besides the home automation capabilities (tied in with my Harmony Hub and my SmartThings Hub), Echo is a great sounding speaker that will play you millions of songs from Amazon Prime Music."
1,I bought it for a gift and I love the price. Also my nice is enjoying it
1,Amazon fire box all that and then some. Very satisfied with my purchase.
1,I use this product all the time. The screen is great and the ads aren't obtrusive at all. It has great battery life. You can send it books as well with the Send to Kindle application available at Amazon.
1,Very easy to use and I like the voice search. The Bluetooth headphones come in handy at night. We get to enjoy all the features with our prime account.
1,Purchased this and I love it! It's easy to setup and easy to use.
1,"When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"
1,This is so much better than the Amazon fire stick for what I use it for.
1,"Works well; however, sometimes doesn't connect requiring user to unplug and re-plug to get connection. Needs a simpler way to store home videos. Background sound and music weakens dialog sound requiring subtitles."
1,"Takes some getting used to but new apps are being developed all the time which increases the usefulness of this product each week. Have ours in the kitchen for music, cooking timers, shopping list, news, games and more."
1,The Fire HD Tablet is portable and very easy to use. It can be held in one hand. The device holds multiple software application options and provides a fantastic blue screen mode at night while reading. I bought three more units when the price dropped to $33 each. The screen is only slightly pixelated compared to other models due to its price point. I would recommend to others.
1,"Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Easy to set up and use. I'm not sure that it's capabilities are any better than ChromeCast or Roku, but I know this product is easy to set up and use. It has more features than I will use."
1,Very good. My grandson uses it on a daily basis. It is fantastic
1,I like playing the games on it and doing email and music that I can listen too.
1,A must have gor streaming apps. Kodi app is ok too if you get it going. Take it when traveling. Works fine as long as yoi have decent wifi
1,"Great for reading, internet and game playing. Small enough to easily carry it in my purse. Definitely recommend!"
1,Awesome Tablet for reading books. Very easy to use. Great value for the price.
1,Easy to setup and fills the room with sound. Easy to move to another room if needed.
1,Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
1,"I like reading and I don't have space for paper books, this is great for me I got everything I need and I can read on my way. I like it."
1,"Awesome little toy, back light eases up the use at night but also does not affect screen quality in sun light."
1,"The paperweight is a fantastic e-reader and the best I've ever used. Great display, fantastic battery life, and a very adjustable front light system work together to create an amazing reading experience. The only thing I would change would be to make it water and dust resistant for beach use. (Which is rumored to be coming in the next model)The ability to borrow ebooks from my library and download them directly on my Kindle is fantastic!"
1,I use this regularly and have had absolutely no issues so far. It streams seamlessly and the remote with the voice automated speech works great.
1,Was easy to set up and very easy to use. For a basic tablet I would recommend it.
1,Overall I love it. Alexa Doesn't find all songs but for the most she will get them.
1,"I purchased the tablets as Christmas gift for my nieces. Perfect for them ages 9, 7, and 5. They love reading and this is a viable option when traveling. Instead of movies when riding in the car, they read!"
1,Needs to buffer less frequently than the current gen Fire stick. Plugged it in and was watching movies on Kodi within 45 minutes. Pretty happy with this.
1,This is a good tablet for beginners. I bought them for my children for Christmas. They have been enjoying them.
1,"This device has amazing features and is much better than the Apple TV with a larger range of available apps. One most prominently is Sling TV, that is not supported by the iOS device. Also this version is much better than the Fire TV Stick due to memory and most importantly the ethernet connection. Definitely worth the extra amount over the Fire TV Stick."
1,"I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great."
0,doesnot work After three weeksI cannot open it. so sad
1,Exceeded my expectations would recommend to anyone who wants a good tablet for a good price.
1,Before I bought this I had a blue tooth speaker and an iPod touch. Both of which had to be charged and turned on etc. now I just tell Alexa to play music.
1,This is a gift for my son which he loved. Good for a music lover.
1,"I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!!"
1,"The Kindle works great for reading outdoors while enjoying the summer weather. My wife loves that font size can be increased so she doesn't need her reading glasses. The kindle automatically adjusts to light. Weather inside or out the Kindle is always easy to read. Opens books right where you left off, regardless of the number of books you read at one time. Highly recommend."
1,"We love this! Sound has great range, full sound. We have recommended this to several friends."
1,Obviously doesn't support everything out there but it's fast and does what I need it to
1,I bought it to use outside to read. My iPad and android are bad in the sun. This I can actually read in the sun!! Happy
1,I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet.
1,"I bought this for my wife who is not much of a tablet person. She likes it now to check emails, news, Skype and such. It was a Black Friday special. It is easy to use and small to carry in her purse. My only complaint is that the videos are not watchable at times but that may be due to my internet connection being slow at times. Overall a Best Buy!"
1,The product is very nice. It is very useful and the battery life is great. It crashes every once in a while but apart from that it is an excellent product to gift to someone due to the convenient price!
1,I recently purchased this tablet as a backup to my IPad. I find myself using it as much as my more expensive tablet!!!
1,"Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price"
1,was just the right size for my husband.and was just what he wanted.was a very good buy for him.thanks alot.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is."
1,Gave to mother for Mother's Day to upgrade her older Kindle. She loves it and enjoys the light since it doesn't cause a glare while reading at night in bed.
1,"This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa."
1,This tablet is perfect and works flawless. I wish i got another one
1,"Excellent value priced 10"" tablet. To bad Amazon killed it. I purchased it as a gift for my wife and she loves the size and quality of the display."
1,Got these as Christmas presents for some of my family members and I must say they love it.
1,Bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it. The only downfall is there is no google play.
1,Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas.
1,If you are thinking about getting the Echo like we were and going back and forth of it. Buy one and you will not be sorry. It is amazing
1,"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you."
1,Make sure u have wifi before you buy a tablet. Cuz it doesn't have wifi in the tablet
1,She's a lot of fun to have around Amazon also has special deals that you can only order through Alexa.
1,"Great product if you are looking for Alexa or a speaker for listening to music. Sleek design, great features, but I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality this unit provides as well."
1,This kindle fire 5th generation 7inches is a very good product.it works well.and best buy customer service was so helpful.
1,I love the quality and ease of using the kindle fire. I will like to purchase more for my family for xmas.
1,This is the second paper white I have bought as a gift. Great product.
1,"Nice, & easy to obtain. My nephew loves it, he has yet to break it"
1,Works well. The kids love it can watch everything on it.
1,I was amazinged that it was just what I wanted and didn't know it. You can read in the sun or dark. The screen has a special filter on it. It does a lot more then you realize. Love my son can look up words and highlight things for school. The library free borrow apps work too. You won't be disappointed. My 12 year old made me buy him his own :)
1,I didn't even know I wanted it until I was in line and saw it for 30$. Could pass it up! I think I paid more for the case for it. I gave it 1 less star because it doesn't have all of the apps and games I like. Otherwise works great and u can use a memory card.
1,"I have had 4 kindles over the years , got to have one to read my books & relax"
1,"Love, love, love the tablet and all it's multi uses and functionality. LOVE IT!!!"
1,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
0,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
1,I bought this for my mother to use she 75 and loving it
1,"I was a total smart technology novice when I purchased my lil' tablet on Black Friday for abt.35 bucks...did not own a single smart gadget -- I still have a dumb phone. I am pleased to say that the lil' tablet is pretty easy to use and does lots of fun tricks, so to speak. Thank you lil' tablet for bringing me, painlessly, into the 21st. century! I would certainly recommend it to a beginner like myself and I don't think it is beneath the consideration of a tech saavier person."
1,The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
1,"Love the ability to read in sunlight, create files."
1,i saw this and wanted it right away. it works good and helps me.it also keeps me company. i would recomend it to anyone out there.

1,"The convenience is great, good sound. Great value."
1,It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.
1,"This makes three I have purchased. This time as a gift. Its fun, accurate and works."
1,"The Fire tablet is great, we just bought our second. It's screen is pleanty big enough to see, but small enough to fit in my jacket pocket."
1,"The Fire TV helped my LED flat screen tv become a smart tv to watch Hulu, Netflix, and listen to music."
1,"The echo is perfect, really enjoying all the things that Alexa can do, excited to finally have this!!"
1,Like responsive of the remote control. Great picture quality output (4K). Amazon prime has great video selection.
1,"Very easy on the eyes. Easy to carry, fits in my purse"
1,A really nice tablet for a first time owner. Works great and has a decent sized screen
1,I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
1,I purchased these for my grand kids for Christmas to watch kid shows on and these were a great price for what I wanted.

1,The kids couldn't wait to turn them on and I'm very excited.
1,"Watching movies listening to music, reading books. All for free and easy to do."

1,"Perfect for kids. He has his own tablet, and I can control all access to everything. I don't have to worry about what he's getting into...."

1,Works Perfect and woujld highly recommend.Was easy to set up!
1,Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem
1,Great kindle for the price nice picture for a 7 inch screen
1,"I bought for my dad who is open to smart technology but still a newbie. He found it is wasy to set up and discovering more uses for it. He's satisfied, so am I!"
1,Got this for Mom to replace an aging iPod she was using. She is reluctant to adopt any new technology but I have loaded all of her apps and saw her on occasion slowly warming up to the device. The only issue I have with Amazon Fire devices is that not all Google Play store apps can be installed. For example you cannot have access to Google Hangouts which Mom would like to use. Anyhow it is a good overall device for people who are starting to use new tech items.
1,"Great product. Nice to just ask for something (weather, music, internet purchases) and get it."
1,This purchase replaced another Kindle Paperwhite that broke when dropped. Paperwhite is a great reader.
1,"I have the echo, the dot and now the tap. The sound is good. Better than the dot but not as good as the echo. The thing the tap has over the echo and dot is its portability. Which is nice not have to be next to a plug all the time. I would recommend it."
0,Good product..Makes life easy.I have no issues so far with this .
1,"I have a cell, a tablet, and now my 4th (?) Kindle. I did NOT want to but this one because the only problem I had with my last one was that something happened to the charging port...i.e., it wouldn't charge.But, I will will always have a kindle because the battery lasts soooooooooo much longer than the battery on my cell and my tablet. I've been taken to task because I have all three and (according to my critics) that is a waste. My choice...get over it."
1,"It is limited to what smarthome items you program it for. I have been able to turn lights, TV and thermostat up, on or off using my voice only. I'm still working on items with IFTTT for other equipment to do things when I get home or wake up. I found that I have to slow down when giving alexa commands as she doesn't always understand what I'm trying to tell her what to do. I had to purchase other equipment just for it to do what I wanted to do. I would recommend that you do your homework and make sure you either have everything or ready to buy the other equipment when you purchase alexa."
1,"I love my new paper white kindle. I have had it a little over a month now. I have had other kindles before, including the Kindle fire. But this new paper white one is the best I have had so far! I love the ability to read it outside, no matter how sunny it is. There is absolutely no glare.This kindle is super light-weight--I carry it in my purse all of the time.This kindle also has an amazing back-light so I can read when it is is dark out.Definitely worth 5 stars!!"
0,I got these for my 4 and 8 year old. They love them
1,Kid proof and works well!! There are plenty of apps too!
1,"The Echo is one our most used devices at home. The voice recognition, while not perfect, is one of the best I've tried (especially when it can hear our voices from afar). What I really enjoy about the Echo is the simple uses, such as quickly setting a timer for cooking purposes or setting an alarm for when playtime is over for the kids. The audio quality is also very decent - we live in an apartment so the size is perfect.Overall, one of Amazon's best devices - if not the best - and one of the most useful you'll have in your home."
1,"great product for the price, I'm pleased with the Kindle Fire and would recommend this product to all age groups."
1,"I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing."
1,I prefer this version of the kindle to the previous generation. It has a backlight that can be adjusted easily and its light weight. I did have a crack appear in my screen and it made the backlight shine through awfully bright in that area. Unsure how it happened but Amazon replaced it nonetheless.
1,Absolutely love it! No problems with it at all and great battery.
1,I love this. I can load all my apps and watch pretty much everything I ever used to watch on cable. The only thing is I wish I could get the Hallmark channel...but other than that I'm very happy for the price.
1,"I bought this to replace my NOOK HD 7"". Screen is way better than the NOOK HD."
1,Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
1,"The image quality is nice, but the speed is much better than the fire stick, increased ram is always a plus."
1,Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it.
0,Great tablet but after about a year it starts acting up and you cannot get help from Amazon to fix it.
1,Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.
1,This product is exactly what I needed and exactly as advertised.
1,"Just make sure you have the proper internet to make it work to it's full potential, but if so, the uses are limitless and you can actually get rid of cable if you do it right!"
1,I really liked the Alexa the only thing I did not like was that it only works with certain music apps. I am kinda of new with this product so I may be wrong but we like the overall use and it's functions.
1,"My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well"
1,Excellent value and good WiFi access Video quality excellent
1,"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
1,The tablet is a great value and resource for our 3 kids!
1,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.
1,We bought the tablets for our kiddos for a great price on a Black Friday deal! Our kiddos love it and it's perfect for their school programs!
1,I'm very happy i chose the amazon fire tablet. It's easy to use and i easily got the apps i needed.
1,Purchased this to test it out. I have a prime membership. The interface seems a little slow and not as intuitive as other streaming players however do like the 4K capability for the price
1,"I bought one of these for myself and another for my sister. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase, it's an overall good value. The OS is very clean and simple to navigate and based on android. I was able to install the Play store without rooting the device by simply installing the apks. Overall it works great with Amazon apps and those I've installed from the play store. The sound quality is fair though the one speaker is a little low at times. Screen quality is good, not HD but decent. The most lackluster part of the tablet is the front facing VGA and non-auto focus rear cam -- I was unable to scan some barcodes with the rear camera. However, at this price point you get a lot for your money. I especially like the amazon underground apps that are totally free and add to the value of the tablet."
1,"I purchased Echo on a lark after being intrigued by several reviews. I already owned two Harmony remotes (one is an Elite) and several automated light switches controlled through an Insteon hub from SmartHome. I can now control most of my lights and home theater with voice-control. Streamed Christmas music throughout the Christmas season and great for getting the weather and news. Of course, all devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network. Be careful if you're an Amazon Prime member, Echo responds to everyone. Have been issues reported that children have ordered products on Amazon without parents' knowledge."
1,"Wife loves it, great price. She thinks it is better than our sons ipad."
1,We love this so much. Adding all the home-automation skills this device offers has made a really cool change in our daily activities. Just speaking to Alexa keeps our grocery list and calendar fully up to date...and with such little effort. The quality of the speaker is also very good....it's pretty much replaced the stereo in our living areas.
1,Awesome product worth it would recommend it Anybody
1,Great product for the price no known issues at the time!
1,I only use Amazon products for streaming and I always recommend them to my friends & acquaintances as well.
1,Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money
1,Bought this for my 9 year old. It's perfect to keep on hand to keep her occupied if we get caught waiting somewhere.
1,"I just needed something with a front facing camera to allow my grandmother to skype with my son. On sale for $40, a tablet that does that and allows you to stream videos...steal. Technology is a trip."
1,I just love this. best investment ever! I am considering buying this again and offering it as a christmas present.
1,It is a tablet that cost $50. You get what you pay for. It is not more powerful than an iPad but it is in my opinion more durable and is easier to pack when traveling. I only use mine to watch videos on the road. It does have trouble connecting to certain wifi spots but this hasn't been a problem at any airports gets.The touchscreen lags but once the video starts going there hasn't been a problem. It cost less than the price to fix a broken screen on an iPhone why pass it up.
1,This is a very servicable tablet ... an excellent value for the price!
1,"I have a Fire HDX from several years ago and this one is so much better. The speed is great and the resolution is fantastic. I wish it had a bigger screen but for the price, what more could one want. I like the power and volume switches placemnt so much better than the HDX."
1,This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!
1,This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.
1,This is the kindle to buy. Great resolution and a backlight is great. The higher end Kindle's don't justify the price difference. Use it all time time and love it.
1,"My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a ""kid proof"" case."
1,I love the ease of set up and how simple it is to use to get to or find what I need!
1,Doesn't always do what I asked for. It is probably because my voice wasn't as clear as it could be.
1,"We were given our first Echo as a Christmas present last year and since then, we have purchased a Echo Dot for our guest room and this 2nd Echo for our Master Bedroom. The sound quality is terrific and we love the convenience of getting quick questions answered, listening to music and being able to stop/start at will, and the overall memory capability of the Echo. We purchased two and will give the 2nd one to a relative for their Christmas present!"
1,"What an amazing device. I can ask it questions about sports, weather, traffic, music ... it tells me jokes, provides me with interesting trivia, turns on my lights in the morning, turns them off at night, plays music and many other useful tricks. This will again revolutionize home functionality in our lives."
1,Family member really likes it and says its fun. Using it all the time.
1,This is by far the best media box on the market. Easy to setup and extremely easy to use. If you are a Kodi user this by far the best box for it. A+++
1,Love the Echo ! Awesome tone to the sound ! Very easy to use I can use this paired thru Bluetooth with my iPhone or I can simply ask Alexa questions. I can access my music from my Spotify or Spotify in general and various other sources. my only recommendation for new products would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a Wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger. However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it!
1,I like the camera is good and it's very fast wifi work awesome
1,Amazon Tap is exactly what I expected it would be. The sound quality is good with the Alexa features. I love that you can charge it on the base or with micro USB cord. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Amazon Echo and would like the portability.
1,My son really enjoys this. Its his first tablet(he is 4) and had no problem learning how to use it.
1,"I like to have a book in my hand when I read, but needed an electronic book reader for our overseas trip. Kindle Whitepaper was great. will you use when I am eating since there is no pages to hold down like you do with a book."
1,it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
1,"Echo technology becomes addictive. The more you use it, the smarter Alexa becomes, learns more about your likes, music etc.I was apprehensive for nothing."
1,It has been a great tablet for my daughter. User friendly.
1,It does what it says it does. Straightforward to set up too.
1,Awesome voice recognition. Great buy even if sole use is as a speaker. Great sound.
1,Great product - would recommend to anyone. Love Best Buy and their experienced staff.
1,Easy to use even my 6year old can do it! We use it on a daily basis to watch Netflix and play games on it!
1,"This was purchased to replace a 1st generation Kindle. The Paperwhite is far superior to my old Kindle, display is easier to read in any lighting scenario and page turning is much better."
1,"A very good handy tablet, good product for the money, excellent integration into AMZN universe of fire tab/website/prime etc, fast and easy to use,"
1,"Great tablet - great apps and performance. I Love it """
0,Should have been included with the e-reader.
1,Needed a new kindle and this fit the bill. Enjoy reading on a kindle.
0,I didn't find the e-reader easy to navigate and actually found it confusing. I have an older model and that one is easier to navigate. The new one was skipping pages sometimes also.
1,"Easy to use, great gor reading, easy to download books"
1,Can't blue tooth to my speaker without slecting it from a list...there is no list...
1,Each of my boys have their own Kindle Fire. They love them! They're easy to use and the micro SD card slot allows you to upgrade the space to add more movies and games. They're especially nice when the wife and I want to enjoy dinner out!
1,I can read my books and sync with my larger tablet. Read emails and search internet. Love it!!!
1,Bought tablet for my five year old nephew. Is affordable and has good specs. Easy to use. Camera and video are good. My nephew has no problem using it
1,Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it
1,This is a great product. I purchased for travel so i wouldn't have to carry my laptop. performs well very quick.
1,"Purchased as gift for senior citizens, and they love them. Not to techy for anyone young to old to use."
1,Replaced our old kindle. Still the best for reading outdoors
1,I sideloaded the .apk file for the Opera web browser from GetJar.com. Works flawlessly since FireOS is based upon Android. Nice little tablet all around.
1,"Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter l, she loves it, so easy to use .. She can navigate through it with no problems"
1,Great started tablet. I purchased this as a started tablet for my niece and she loves it.
1,"This has become the go to source for our family. We placed it in the kitchen and whether we want to know the news, the weather, a joke or just to listen to music this device has not let us down. We are just now starting to buy adapters to allow the device to control lights. All with the sound of your voice. Very cool!!"
1,This device works great and is capable of so much!
1,Better performance and more options that my firestick. As it should for the extra cost and added size. Still a nice compact little package though. Very happy with this purchase and runs all of the programs I use very well. Expandable storage is a huge plus!
1,"An amazing, interactive, fun machine. Superb sound, powerful mike, and with internet connection, unlimited music."
1,My kids love these Tablets .. They work well . They seem to work great. From what I've seen the battery lasts a long time .They are expandable up to 128gb possibly more sd card. The price was rite to. my sons dropped his a couple times and it still works...All and All I would rate it 5 of 5 we are very happy.. I strongly suggest these tablets . my kids have broken way more expensive tablets .I bought my nephews kindles years ago they still use them .
1,Really love this product it's fast portable and we can stream all our favorite shows.
1,Enjoyed the firesticks for a while but was tired of how much buffering time it took because of Wifi. Spending the extra $40 to plug this directly into the modem was well worth it. Haven't had a buffering issue at all. 1080P full movies load and play in a matter of seconds!!
1,Works great. Fast uploading and doesn't take up any space.
0,Must have Amazon paid service to play music from the cloud and must be set up from the mobile app. Not portable. Cannot connect to Fire tv. Took some getting use to for me to get the commands right to change my nest thermostat. Must use the app to install 3rd party skills to the app to control smart devices.
1,"Works great, easy to carry. Covers my needs when traveling."
0,"I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the Google Play store to be installed. Without that capability this tablet isn't very good. Amazon just doesn't have enough apps available. I did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store. I also notice that this isn't a ""snappy"" and ""fast"" device but I wouldn't expect it to be for $50. For the right situation this is a great buy."
1,"Links to your Amazon Prime account and you can watch thousands of movies, tv shows and get endless apps."
1,this Kindle is much faster and has significantly brighter screen than my first generation product. Wish I had purchased it sooner!
1,"This was a Christmas present for our 8 year-old. It is perfect for kids. It was inexpensive, but it still gives him access to games and educational apps. Much to his dismay, we limit his screen time, but he really enjoys this product."
1,I love it .......................................
1,I had purchased the same Kindle about 2 years ago. I love it. So I bought one for my son as well.
1,"We love our new tablet. We got it to bring with us for our 2 year old when we go out. For the price we were not worried if something sgould haopen to it. Works great, good speed. Well worth it."
1,Easy to use and definitely recommend. Can do so many things with it. Wouldn't be without it.
1,We love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly.
1,This is the perfect tablet for someone who will just be doing web surfing and video watching. Price point is perfect.
1,takes a little to set up but works great and improves each day
1,"This was my first Alexa device and until I got a dot I was very satisfied with it After the Dot, I missed the voice activation. No Amazon has updated the software to where it will respond to voice commands so not problems with it at all . You need to keep it on the charge stand if you are going to use voice commands."
1,This tablet was purchased as a Christmas gift and our nephew absolutely loves it.
1,"Purchased the Echo for my wife as a birthday present from our kiddoes. Not only does she use it to add things to the grocery list, etc, the kids love asking all sorts of questions. Plus helps my son with his homework. Only drawback is if your playing music past level 8/10 sometimes it won't hear your wake up command. You'll have to press the wake up button on top. Overall we have all enjoyed it!"
1,I had a kindle for years. It finally would not keep a charge. I like the smaller Kindle for my books so it is easy to hold in bed at nite. This is perfect.
1,Perfect gadget for reading purpose. Reasonable price too.
1,I bought this tablet because it was a cheap alternative to use it on roadtrips and watch movies. It also is perfect for the kids to play with it without worrying to much if they break it.
1,Great device. Works well. Very handy. Got it as a gift for my father. Own one as well.
1,Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
1,"My 12yr old daughter loves it, she did not want an expensive high end tablet. This tablet is very light, very good sound and fast. The plastic screen does not feel of any less quality than a glass screen."
1,I got this for a cheap tablet and I love having it
1,"It was a Christmas present for my children and I think I made a excellent choice. I don't hear all the nagging and irritating out of them.I finally get to have a peace of mind also make sure to get insurance.I think the price was good to, I wish I didn't wait so late to make my purchase so I could have gotten them different colors."
1,"For the money, this is a very good tablet. I bought this as a gift for my dad. He loves it, and he uses it everyday."
1,"I've bought 2 of these tablets now for my kids, they're a great value for its low price. Great screen quality, everything you need in a tablet and good size. Very happy with them."
1,Exceeds all expectations and perfect fit for my 9 year old.
0,"I use this Amazon Kindle for Web browsing & social media. Convenient for traveling, but camera sucks so use your phone for pictures."
1,This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it.
1,We bought this tablet for a 8 year old boy. Works really well. We have had no problems with anything. It is used primarily for games.
0,"My daughter got this for Christmas. Right out of the box it came on, but the screen was all white. Good price, but could never get it to work."
1,Ordering from Amazon is now easier than ever. Don't be scared by the recent news hype.
1,I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the number of books she is able to access. It wasd a Christmas hit!
1,This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
1,Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.
1,"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"
1,This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
1,I especially like the integration of Netflix and the voice control.
1,Got it for a Christmas gift. She loves it. She stays on it all the time.
1,I have bought 3 of these tablets for my great grand children. excellent for learning and u don't use data.
1,"My son loves this tablet, he will not put it down!"
0,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
1,Terrific product. Clear sound. Plays great music. Very enjoyable.
1,Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend.
1,This is one of the coolest things I own. With the 3.99 music unlimited plan I can request any song or album plus all of the wiki and current news/weather features. New content and features are added daily.
1,Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house.
1,This smart box does exactly what it says it does. I like that it adds the pics and videos from my cell phone in an easy to use app.
1,Works great. I bought this for my 7 year old after she broke her other kindle. It works just as good as her Kindle fire HD but it was way cheaper. There's not a lot of storage but for $50 I won't complain.
1,Battery seems to drain quickly. Otherwise very happy with this device! Great price!
1,"Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
1,Great buy. Deff worth the money. Much faster than my phone
1,"Bought this as a replacement for the 7"", faster and better display.... Best upgrade"
1,"We have an Echo in the kitchen and bedroom for listening to music and controlling our Hue bulbs. If you're going to do any music, definitely get this over the Dot. We have a Dot too but in the office where we already have speakers :)"
1,My son just loves it and he thinks it's easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it
1,"I used to use iPad as a reader, but my eye got tired easily. Kindle just like the book, and the battery can last longer."
1,"Compact, light, and extremely easy on the eyes when reading."
1,"We have been using Roku for a couple of years, when they started going bad decided to try something new. Now we have replaced both Roku with the Amazon Fire. Works great and looks good. Very portable and easy to hook up."
1,"I have found little to complain about since purchasing this device. It's sturdy, bright, and a touchscreen.Perfect for what you use it for. Get a nice case for it and it becomes indestructible!"
1,love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
1,We love these so much we've put one on each floor of our house so we don't have to move them from our basement or living room.
1,"When I just want to read, the Kindle Paperwhite is everything I need. It does not strain my eyes, so I can read longer if I want. The front lit screen is perfect in dim light. It is small, so I can take it with me easily. I send documents to it regularly and I prefer reading it than anything else!"
1,I love this tablet! It's user friendly and my kids love it! I'm so glad I bought this tablet!
1,"Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc."
1,"This has been a great addition to our family...haha! The kids love it. And for the price it can't be beat, maybe by the mini me version the Echo Dot."
1,Bought for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it.
1,"Very basic tablet which I purchased mostly as an e-reader. It's battery life is quite short. As a reader it is poor in the sunlight. I'd recommend if the price point is important, but you get what you pay for."
1,"Exactly what was expected, easy to read, portable, good battery life. Has adds which are annoying but do not interfere with reading. Not idea for reading Manga or comics but works well enough."
1,"I can read, even in the dark. I can surf the internet, Facebook, pay bills, play games. It was inexpensive and I love it!"
1,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
1,Alexa is a great device. Makes things like playing music and information so convenient. The skills that can be added are entertaining and helpful as well
1,"We really enjoy Echo , Alexa is quick with our request . I only wish she had more information like Google."
1,"Amazon Echo is amazing, weather, sports, music and all the questions you can ask, my whole family loves it"
1,"I upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite from a 1st generation Nook, I think just about any e-reader would excite me.However, I did my research and decided that the Paperwhite was a perfect fit for me. * I love the speed of the downloads and the ease of the touch screen. * I love being able to keep track of different characters just by pressing on their name (as well as definitions of words that are not familiar) * I love the backlight - no more trying to read at night with a glaring light over my shoulder. *I love the battery life. Not having to recharge it everyday is awesome!* I love how lite it feels and the way it fits in my hand - soooo much better than the Nook... overall smaller in size although the screens are the same size.I am an Amazon Prime member and some of the books that I have downloaded (and ones on my wish list) are half the cost of the same B&N books.I find that I am reading much more and totally enjoying the experience of my Kindle. I wish I hadn't waited so long!!Last but not least, I LOVE buying from Best Buy. I love their protection plans and when needed, they have always saved us $$$."
1,"I love this thing. It gets used all the time in our house. It is so versatile and has so many possible connections. Only thing is, be prepared to spend more money on other things to pair with it."
1,Easy to set up and very simple to use.very light and compact.
1,"Hi Everyone, Alexa is the best of the best. I feel like she knows me more and more each week. She is a STRONG speaker for my love of music. She knows like everything ever. I ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something. She does struggle a little with recent events. But that will get better with time. She is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar. In a word. AWESOME!"
1,"I was hesitant to add more gizmos in my life, but after a trial run got hooked on it. Response at times is not forthcoming but I guess with time it will get better. So far so good. Does what is intended."
1,We purchased this Echo as a gift for my son - and he loves it! Setup was easy and he's having a lot of fun with it. Really makes a good gift!
1,Bought for work I just use the wi fi and get music all day long. Plenty loud enough. $$ well spent.
1,We have a Roku device and was wanting another device for another room and after reading the reviews we decided on the Amazon Fire TV. It has taken a bit to get used to the layout since we'd been using the Roku for over 5 years. But overall we're happy with the purchase and would recommend the Amazon Fire TV.
1,Great tablet for a beginner. I'm impressed with its features
1,Seems to work even better and faster than the fire tv stick.
1,I bought this item for my son and daughter in law for Christmas this year. it has not entered service yet
1,"After reading both positive and negative reviews, took the plunge because it was on sale and wanted 4k.Had a little difficulty setting up/ scrolling the onscreen keyboard/ inputing passwords because the remote didn't work properly out of the box...after the system updated the firmware, no more problems. After moving the unit to another house, wasn't dfficult setting up on that network.Some reviewers said that the menu is too Amazon-centric. Does have a lot, but no problem downloading and using other streaming services (Crackle, YouTube, etc)4K: limited content, but quality seems okay on a 50"" 4k tv. Need a fast connection.Has an app- it could be better.If you don't need 4k, and have an iDevice house, Apple's box would be a more compatible choice..."
1,"bought for my grand Daughter who loves it, replaced and older Kindle, this works much better for her."
0,Bought for $40 for my toddler. Mostly used for Netflix and a few kid games.
1,Love it. Great gift for those that like things to be more convenient. Why get up every five seconds when alexa can do it for you.
1,"My niece loves this tablet. It's very durable, but charges slow"
1,"This is my second Echo. I have one in the living room that I use every day and needed one for the bedroom. I never thought I'd need a product like this but It has become an integral part of daily way of life. The sound is great. I use it for my alarm, to get weather info, and latest news. I plan on getting my lights and thermostat connected. A+"
1,"I have missed my Pandora since I moved from Ft. Worth, TX to Colorado a few months ago. My nephew had the Amazon Tap and I was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it ( saying.. ALEXA.. tell MIMI (their Grandmother) to GO TO BED.. AND IT DID!! And the sound and quality of music coming from it. Awesome. :) I had to have one, so I went to local Best Buy and bought it. I even set it up myself (I'm 65 so was impressed with myself! LOL) but I have listened nonstop to 60s music or music from DIRTY DANCING (which I loved). I have ordered a little case from Amazon.com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room, which I have been doing. I feel like I have a new found friend.... love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as BOSE in my book! Get it, you'll love it! I DO!! :) VERY VERY pleased with it! Weather updates here or where my kdis are. Just checking. :)No interruptions or commercials when listening ALL DAY LONG!"
0,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/
1,"I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!"
1,This is great for watching Amazon original shows and free tv
1,"I was using a Kindle Paperwhite and when I saw this on sale for black Friday, I figure why not. I have been very pleased so far."
1,"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
1,"it is awesome for the price can't ask for more, and it's on sale when i got it."
1,My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
1,It a great personal assistant. Love how easy it is to use and connect with other devices.
1,Item was easy to set up. Work as advertised Very Cool
1,I love this tablet. It's just the perfect gadget for my everyday life.
1,Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
1,My daughter loves the kindle fire and uses it on a daily basis in school and at home.
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift and he loved it.
1,Bought this tablet for my daughter so far so good!
1,This is a great product and you begin to rely on using alexa. I would recommend readings about all the echoes prieo to buying so that you choose the one that most fits you. I was glad I did because it could be overwhelming when you get to the store.
1,Favorite streaming device hands down totally worth it.
1,At first wasn't so sure about getting the Echo. Finally after reading reviews and the things it could do I bought one. So far it has worked great and looking forward to being able to continue to expand its capabilities and help smart wire my house.
1,"I purchased for my 9 year old daughter, its a plus"
1,Faster then the fire stick plus SD card for storageWorth the extra price
1,"Very happy with the Echo purchase!! Useful for whole family, very interactive and fun. Great for music/playlists and learning."
1,This is very fast and no buffering for non Amazon movies. I definitely recommend this product. I got this one in deal not paying full price at Best buy beats the others in price and product performance.
1,"Love that I could buy a card to increase storage, the Picture quality was awesome! And the price was very reasonable! I had one happy granddaughter"
1,Just love that breadth of tv entertainment available from this!
1,I really enjoy the convenience and portability. It is easy to read a few pages when I want.
1,"I bought two Echoes, one for my wife and one for me. I expected something along lines of Siri, and Google that could follow many commands. You have to say very specific commands to get a response. Also Echo cant distinguish commercials, when one of its commercials come on, it tries to answer questions when it hears Alexa. I have also been trying to set up my wife's echo to do phone calling, but can't pull up her page to setup the option but it is not there.We like it, but still trying to learn all it can do."
1,Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
1,I like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice. You can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say Alexa.
1,I love my new fire tv. Don't have to wait for movies to refresh.. awesome!!
1,Amazon has the right idea with building an affordable yet quality tablet that provides wonderful access to Prime content.
1,Great product for the money and a newbie who has never used a tablet
1,"Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
1,able to read many more books and very nice to handle
1,"The Echo is the coolest tech in my home! With ""Alexa"" there to answer all questions, play music and read books....the possibilities are endless. Just check it out!"
0,"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV after owning the Roku 3 for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and Apple TV. I am a Prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice. However, the remote is very unresponsive, disconnecting more than it stays connected. The menu layout is very ""ad-centric"" and pushes you towards how Amazon wants you to view their service. When the remote works, the Amazon TV seems sluggish in comparison to the other products I tried. After several hours of fighting with the remote, I decided to return it and get another Roku...possibly the version 4. Good try Amazon, but far from being close to either Roku or Apple TV."
1,Bought a couple of these for my kids. They love being able to watch videos and play games on their own tablets.
1,"Was a little skeptical because it was so cheap, but a perfect tablet for my 6year old!"
1,"For those who truly just want an EReader, the kindle gets the job done. No glare , easy to use."
1,I really like this media streamer it works better than expected.
1,A great small tablet - works very well for a young person.
1,Kindle paperwhites are amazing. They are so simple and non distracting. They are very pleasing to the eyes and not having to recharge it every night is great. Can't wait to take it on vacation and read in the sunshine without getting a headache from the reflection of my tablet.
1,Received as Christmas gift and I love the size and features of the kindle.
1,"I bought this for my daughter and I have no complaints. It's a little slow compared to my iPad, but it's perfect for a child."
1,Great product works great easy to hookup sounds awesome
1,The alexa is handy to have. But you do have to load apps into your phone and send to her. Its always a work in progress.
1,Having not used android before I found this tablet very easy to use.
1,Great tablet for kids I would buy more if I needed to
1,"The touch page Turner is great, you don't have to finger swipe. Although it does take a little more pressure to use than I like I still think it is a great feature."
1,I bought this product as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it! She uses it to listen to her Spotify playlists while getting ready for school and doing homework. She even uses it to determine the weather for the day.
1,"Best and least expensive tablet you can find. Great for movies, apps and games. Perfect for kids."
1,"I like this product, the sound and quality is good."
1,Super easy to read in any light! So easy to download books!
1,"It does work well, the only issue is it just needs more support. I understand that more is coming all the time. I do enjoy it"
1,"The echo is a great item with lots of compatibility for the smart products I bought, and is also good at being a decent radio/music player when I'm bored."
1,"Love it!!! works very well.. I already had amazon prime service and was loving it for fast delivery and no shipping charges... Now, i am getting more bonus out of Prime for using Fire TV!!! works great. some of apps do not work very well. but, that's the app. most of app works fine. I am sure people will continue to fall in love with amazon TV and App will continue to improve."
1,Good for reading and apps. I use it as well as my teenage son. Easy to use but now wishing I purchased the next size up
1,This particular version of kindle is really good for reading ebooks.
1,Great tablet for kids! Both of my children love it!
1,First one had issues from the update that was loaded upon installation. Returned and waited several weeks before buying a replacement. Seems to work better.
1,"I have owned the apple TV 1,2 gen; Amazon fire stick, direct computer to tv hookup via hdmi cable, roku and none compare to the performance and GUI of this product."
1,"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!"
1,We had one when they first came out. Not quite as good but still works great for the kids.
1,The Tap is a great companion to your every day business. It has become my partner in my daily communications.
1,Bought for grandkids. They loved it and I'd recommend it to everyone.
1,I bought the Fire TV to watch Playstation Vue. It has a good app for that. I like the setup and the ability to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos.
1,This device is awesome! Even better when it's in TurboMode!! Really love the hologram feature...makes everything so life like. Highly recommend purchasing this! Get It!!
1,The tablet works great and charges with in on hour boight for my kids.
1,Have no complaints. The Paperwhite has opened up a whole new world for me because my eyes do not get tired.
1,"Great purchase, I would like to have two,!!!!!,!,!,!,!,"
1,Love the screen; very easy on the eyes compared to other electronic devices. This this can handle some drops and a little bit of water too; i;m glad that it's tough.
1,The fire tablet is a great tablet. I've purchased 2. The kids have shattered the screen on both and still work great!
1,We are very much enjoying our Echo. Our grand children do too. Alexa answers all sorts of questions for us and we particularly enjoy the music we request. We have an app downloaded on our tablet so we can listen to podcasts and radio stations too. It's great!
1,This is like having a fire stove with a screen its the best and at a great price
1,I already had the Amazon Firestick. The FireTV is faster and even better!
1,Love it will recommend it to my friends.Found it to be as good as having a I pad.You can take good photos and face time as well as text.A vary llite tablet that comes in a number of colors.You can also use it out doors because it has a polarizing filter.
1,"Bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. She has really enjoyed it. It is easy on her eyes, light weight, and keeps a god charge. It is easy to use, but she does already have experience using the original Kindle."
1,I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. It's a perfect size and very convenient for her age .
1,It is a good tablet for $50. I like the ability to create adult and child profiles.
1,I bought two of these during black Friday for my boys and they love them.
1,The 4k paired with our 4k television gives an amazing picture! Well worth it!
1,Got it as a Christmas gift for my Grandpa works a lot better than his computer so he can email
1,Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
1,Picked up one of thear love it easy to set up and install great price
1,Great product works and sounds awesome would not recommend Dot too small speaker sucks
1,Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
1,I love the echo and adding the 2nd to our house has made it possible to synchronize our family. We use it to manage our shopping list and schedule everything. The echo also sounds great in the larger rooms.
1,I love amazon tv products. Takes 5 minutes to install.
1,"I bought this for my 9 year old. It perfect for playing not to heavy games and for reading. The only down side is that not apps are available in the amazon App Store. Others than that not bad at all. Also side loading the no available apps don't work all the time. If your looking for something to surf the net and watch movies on, then this little table is perfect for you."
1,Great device for children. Impressed by the specs.
1,The Echo is a fun gadget. It would be nice if you could give it any name you want but other than that it is a lot of fun.
1,Alexa is great. We use it all the time and it loaded with information from traffic to weather to store locations hours etc. The more you use her the more she does
0,"You will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online. I will cover some other general observations,If you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. But the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. You have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.You will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with ""Convert"" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email (refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email). However it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain (varies from pdf to pdf). Also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,It will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. I found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.Battery usage is fantastic.Another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience. They have settings to adjust brightness as well."
0,It is inexpensive tablet. The sound is not great too quiet.It is not the best but it is good price.
1,"I've been using both Roku (embedded into LG TV) and the Amazon Fire Tv. The true winner is the Amazon Fire TV since it always works, very fast, as expected, no issues, no bugs. The Roku instead is slower (takes time to react and load content). I mainly use Netflix and YouTube. Amazon Fire TV delivers outstanding menu navigation and fast response while searching/navigating through content (movies, tv shows, videos). Also Amazon Fire TV is always on and ready and you can take advantage of Alexa to use your voice to command (useful from time to time)."
1,"The product met my need. Runs very smoothly with an occasional lag but nothing significant, Greatly exceeded previous box I had which constantly lagged and had problems loading. Mind you this box cost doubled the cost of the Amazon box"
1,"it just works. I use it to control lights, thermostats, listen to radio/podcasts/music and set timers/alarms."
1,"For the price, it's the best tablet you're going to find. It's pretty quick (though not as quick as the more expensive models) and holds a ton of books and a decent amount of movies. Display is nice (again, not as nice as the more expensive Kindle Fires). But it is totally worth what I paid for it."
1,"Firesticks are cheap, but getting the fire tv meant less buffer time and less lag before watching my shows!"
1,verygood low end tablet rivals some of the more expensive. does everything it says.
1,This was a nice edition to my entertainment add ons. Makes watching tv more of a pleasure. The price wasn't that bad either.
1,"Alexa and I are best friends. She plays music, tells jokes, reminds of my shopping list, and on and on..... She's great!"
1,This is a great tablet for the money. Runs fast and works seamlessly with Amazon Prime membership. Prime is not required to use this by the way. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment. We havent tried to use this for business purposes though.
1,Now she can read in bed and not bother me!! She loves this thing for her books. We have tablets and everything else but this is great for just reading.
1,"This is my third Alexa, and I'm very satisfied with its functionality. It works well with smart devices such as lights, locks, thermostats, and so on.. I highly recommend it if you're in the market for a similar device. Don't think twice."
1,I would recommend Amazon Alexa. Been just using her to answer weather and general questions. Have a lot more to learn and try. Get new ideas everyday.
1,"We've had a lot of fun programing and working with the Amazon Echo. Great product with solid utility around the family living space - we use it to get news, weather and even turn on the TV (and associated devices)!!! Works great and constantly updated. So pleased that we bought one for one of my brothers and his family."
1,Awesome reader. Great light control to read in bed at night within waking your Partner.
1,"Great tablet for kids to play games, school apps and reading"
1,I purchased this after owning the Amazon Fire Stick. The Fire TV is faster and has expandable memory. We have since cancelled our satellite TV and rely on the Fire TV for our entertainment. Easy set up and perfect for Amazon Prime members.
1,I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
1,Love it. Good size for travel. Great features. No glare when using outside in the sun.
1,Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
1,I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.
1,"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
1,The new kindle has so many great features and is an excellent upgrade over the previous version. I love the ease in using it and it is so compact and light i take it every where. A perfect christmas gift and great value for the price.
1,"The touch control, page change controls, are a little to sensitive. Web browser ""too"" experimental."
1,"Love, love, love the Amazon Fire Stick! Works really well and is easy to use!"
1,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was looking for a simple e-reader. He loved it! It is simple without the fancy features of a tablet, but it works for what he wanted - to simply read books. The no-glare screen and optional back light are both great features!"
1,I m hoping that it doesn't have the same battery port charging issues that the first generation had.
1,Bought as a gift. Feedback has been 100% positive!
1,Great tablet but doesn't charge fast take a while to charge have to remove case to charge and I Brought 3 can be a hassle with kids
1,Fantastic product. Led to significant home automation.
1,Better that reading for the phone or traditional tablet
1,"That's my only issue with it, vs the last one. But it was bought for a living room tv that does not use it so no biggie. Easy to install Kodi on. Just wish they would decode VC-1 files smoothly. Maybe the next gen?"
1,"My vision is failing, but this is easy to read in any light. It fits nicely in my purse to take anywhere."
1,I love this Kindle the ease of use and the amount of books I can carry in a small package is awesome
1,"This is my first tablet. Use it mostly for checking email and using face book. I have not used it for reading books yet, but plan too."
0,"Purchase the echo with my Vivint system because sales person pushed the product stating it would enhance the Vivint capabilities. Not really so...it's a nice gadget for music and putting together shopping lists and ""to-do"" lists, but not really something we needed. In addition, not enough apps that work with it."
1,"Great item and great price. Use it mainly for books, but good enough for basic internet activity"
1,"I purchased this Kindle for my husband, as a gift. I can't believe how fast it is."
1,"It is easy to use & is small & compact. I can read my email, shop, read books., take pictures & play games all at my fingertip."
1,Small and compact but great for reading books and gaming. Will try Netflix down loads next.
1,The individual seemed to enjoy the echo. I will say I do like playing music from it. Good speaker.
1,"Great tablet, great price. Perfect gift for your child. My daughter loves it."
1,Did everything I wanted. Definitely need a good Internet connection
1,This tablet is very kid friendly. You log on the tablet and the kids is having fun...
1,already own two of these so i am familiar with product. this is a present
0,Nice Amazon Fire tablet But...the camera is not clear enough 2.0 megapixels and Amazon Fire is very slow wedsite and app it takes very forever download I think I have to returned on best buy and buy a good tablet 10.1 Lenovo and Samsung Galaxy...I will gave a Zero Rating Star
1,"Bought this for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas. He uses it for kid games (not true gaming). Parental restrictions/blocks work well. He seems to love it. I think this is a perfect ""first"" tablet or nice tablet for an adult not needing all the bells and whistles of a more expensive one. It is smaller and easily carried so it is perfect for web surfing, reading books, and simple games. At this price point, I think it was a great purchase."
1,"After our Insignia tablet died, I purchased two of these so my daughter and I didn't have to share. We both love it! Easy for her (9) to use for games, music, movies. Good battery life and fairly quick charging. Great value."
1,"Awesome tablet my wife loves it, got it for a present, read books surf the net watch Hulu and Netflix real cheap"
1,I got this kindle fire for a Secret Santa gift that my family does each year! I was so excited when I was able to get it on sale which made it in the price range of the Swap! This was a huge hit and he continues to use this today a year later!
1,"this I ,y grandson's second tablet. his first was a nabi. this one is very easy to use and setup. can also use parental controls. he and I both love it!"
1,Love this Kindle. You can adjust the font.It reads well outside no problems with sunlight. Best purchase.
1,"Like system for live sports, movies ,TV shows and kids shows.."
1,My only knock against this product is my girlfriend uses it so much I barely have a chance to read on it.
1,Tablet is Worth for the Price. It is really fast in response.
1,Very good Music quality to rival some more expensive speakers. This is in a course in addition to all of its inquiry function and now a wider range of controlling household devices such as thermostats lights. Overall a very good investment.
1,Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
1,It's a great product I would recommend this to everyone!
1,"Works great, reasonably-priced easy-to-use ,perfect for the Kindle . Quick charge, lightweight, compact and stores easily anywhere. Thanks for the info about unit when purchasing our new Kindle"
1,"Love it, had the stick and it was kinda slow navigating. This one is much faster. Was going to use this and cancel cable. When I told my cable company I wanted to cancel and I was just going to stream everything they cut my bundle cost by $100. I kept cable but I also still use my firetv alot."
1,This has been one of the most valuable accessories I have purchased from Best Buy in a long time. I do encourage everyone to find a use for it
1,"We did a lot of research when looking for a streaming device to use on an outside television as we didn't want to add another cable box. Amazon Fire TV was the best option. It is so convenient and easy to use. The voice commands are excellent. It also has several apps that are unavailable on Apple TV that we truly enjoy, such as TCM. It also has USB port available. We highly recommend Amazon Fire TV for anyone searching for a streaming device!"
1,"Great device, I have one, and purchased one for my mother. It's great for streaming things off amazon prime, but also good for downloading E-books."
1,Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
1,I purchased this gift for my mom who loves to read and did not own a tablet. It was an inexpensive gift she will enjoy.
1,Im happy with the over all uses of this tablet. It gives me comfort and easy to use. I even bought my mom one for mother's day. The tablet has a kids feature and my four year old daughter can watch and play with out changing my features.
1,"This is a great little tablet for people who want to learn more of the modern world. Simple programs, easy hook up to wifi and an easy touch screen. The only down side is the lack of memory, which is ok since this is my kids first tablet."
1,"I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come"
1,"I have more fun with this thing… I'm much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news, because Alexia is constantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go. There's no pairing required, so I simply call out her name and she responds. There is always a battle between me and my teenager, trying to outshout Alexa instructions, so we can hear the music that we like best!"
1,Bought this to do reading and store PDFs. Great if you are a college student that has to read many articles. Good Luck!!!
1,WE USE IT WITH DIRECT tv NOW AND ITS GREAT. wE HAVE IT HARD WIRED TO OUR ROUTER.
1,Have be very happy with the line of products so far
0,Alexa has a hard time answering. You need to download information online in order to build her data base.
1,"I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that's alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games!"
1,"simple to istall, very easy to use , blends well with the decor"
1,Very easy to operate and convenient to travel with.
1,We purchased the digiland tablet and it wasn't good at all due to the picture quality. Thats what I get for buying cheap. Pay $10 more and this tablet is awesome compared to the last one.
1,I bought this for my mom she is an avid reader she has nothing but the best comments about this paper white kindle so im gonna have to say this product is amazing for your self or as a gift for some 1 that reads alot.
1,"I purchased this for my husband a few weeks ago. My husband loves Amazon Echo, I should say Alexa! This is very fun to use and ask questions and get answers, and so much more, only limit is your imagination...I think my husband likes Alexa better than me. Just joking, maybe not...lol."
1,This is by far one of the best investments ever. I got rid of my TV service.
0,This makes my phone way to big can't fit in pockets
1,This is an excellent little tablet for the price. I am please with screen clarity and speed.
1,I like this tablet very much. For the price I couldn't ask for more. Very user friendly. Very kid friendly too.
1,Great box for the money and it is so easy to use and enjoy
1,"Loving this little box. Great interface, and works well with Kodi, even though you have to jump through hoops to get it installed."
1,Love the size and weight of this. I read my Amazon books and comics on here and am always impressed with how easy to use.
1,I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
1,This is one of the best media player i have owned.
1,These boxes are must faster than the stock and have more memory. They are not bulky which is nice. The fire stick seems to overheat and I haven't had that problem with the box.
1,"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
1,"Bought one for my son a while back, now got one for my daughter. Great tablet for whole family at a great price."
1,love it great for kids my son loves it and wont put it down
1,Great quality sound. Very easy to use. I can connect to almost everything in my house.
1,Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too.
1,I bought this and we have had no problems at all with it
1,Very easy to use. Very convenient and lightweight.
1,Fire stick from amazon very good product. .very nice
1,I am very happy with my recent purchase of the Echo.It is like having a genius in a tube.
1,Great tablet for kids or a stater tablet for someone.
1,Love it and would definitely recommend! Has great picture
1,My daughter loves this tablet. It's not as big and flashy as some but it has all the bells and whistles needed.
1,This is my daughters second purchased kindle..great product for reading games and searching the web..durable and affordable.
1,"This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household."
1,"Got this to replace my iPhone that my daughter constantly has to have to watch her Elmo videos. This is a durable perfect solution. She understands most of the apps and can navigate to watch whatever she wants. This comes with a warranty that if she does anything to break it, it will be replaced for free. That was the final selling point I needed!"
1,Our daughter and her friend purchased the Echo and I loved it.... my husband bought me one for my birthday and I love it....
1,"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
1,"I bought a kindle fire 2 years ago and enjoyed using it, I always wished for more storage and better connectivity. This new model has both and I can use with my amazon account."
1,"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
1,Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.
1,Very good media player with a lot of options and features.
1,This tablet is a great beginner tablet. Amazing price! My child has used it over the last year with no issues. I'm buying another as a gift.
1,Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.
1,"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
1,I gave a 5 star review because its a great tablet for a child with disabilities
1,It's great for streaming my shows and playing my games like candy crush
1,For the price this does a lot. Purchased as a gift for my mother who is in here 70's. She loves that she can play her games and download books to read when ever she wants. Great value.
1,Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.
1,Bought this tablet for my daughters to play apps on and to watch Netflix shows. It's nice that it has 2 cameras and expandable memory. Great price.
1,For all it can do at this price level is amazing. Makes great gift too
1,"Bought for my 8yo twins. They love it. Games, camera, and videos. Easy to use."
1,Great product. Best buy had the best prices around.
1,Have a fire stick and it's ok but after using this is wouldn't even consider getting the stick due to the performance of this.
1,"The resolution is obviously more subtle than my old kindle but the back light is not very even, especially on the bottom. It's a common issue for the new generation."
1,This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.
1,This device is excellent picture and sound. Would recommend.
1,"Went to buy the Kindle Paperwhite, but after comparing them side-by-side I decided to buy the Voyage. I thought that the print was a little sharper and I liked the smaller and lighter weight. I have been using it almost every day and really, really enjoy it."
1,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base."
1,The product was in good condition and my child enjoyed it
0,Love my Kindle Fire but I am really disappointed in the Kindle Power Fast Charging Unit. I've had it two months and I've used it many times - The first two times it worked okay but failerd on the third and many subsequent tries. I've disposed of it and use my wife's iPad Nano charger which always works just fine.
1,"My husband loves his new kindle. Lightweight, fast, and the origami cover is great."
1,"Easy set up and use. Beautiful screen, comfortable and light weight. No eye strain!"
1,There is also a way to add the play store ..... so I have heard :)
1,This is a great new piece of tech if you are savy with it. If not it takes a while to learn but its follow the steps
1,Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily.
1,This is a great price point for this tablet. I bought 3 of them for my family to use to supplement their iPhones. YouTube and Netflix are easier to watch on the tablet's larger screen.
1,"Works great . Able to listen to radio ,watch tv shows ,"
1,"Love this device. It is so much fun to use. I listen to music including 60's classics. Get weather report, traffic report, late breaking news. I can control my lighting with Echo."
1,"I bought this tablet and used it for two days and felt like returning it. It didn't have play store, amazon' s version of Android literally kills the processor and makes it too slow. Web browsing through silk browser was a pain. It took for ever to load even simple pages like google. Apps were all useless, and the only thing you could do is listen to preloaded music( not streaming music) and read ebooks. Anyway, I changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it. Installed slimLp and got rid of Amazon's junk, and it made a huge difference. The performance is way better and it actually works like a decent tablet now. It's a great tablet for the price only if its rooted. If you have no idea of rooting or don't like to risk it, its not worth a penny! Its a good buy if you plan on rooting it."
1,"She loves her kindle and reads it every night. I am Looking forward to seeing her face when she opens this in a couple weeks - better screen and WiFi that works. The old one lost WiFi connection in an update or something but works with USB, its about 4 years old. Even with those issues she loves the old one. So this one is going to be spectacularly awesome and the new screen and features are gonna be so appreciated...."
1,Good for its purpose. lightweight travel companion.
0,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017. I RETURNED THIS ITEM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF PURCHASE. I MAILED IT BACK PER INSTRUCTIONS BY AMAZON. TODAY MAY 26 I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM AMAZON THAT THEY FAILED TO RECEIVE THE ITEM BY JUL. 20 SO THEY WILL CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOMEONE IN AMAZON RECEIVING DID NOT DO THEIR JOB LOGING IN THE ITEM OR US MAIL LOST THE ITEM. EITHER WAY I AM SCREWED.
0,"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
1,This was the perfect gift for my Neice and nephew I bought two
1,"Have a few issues. Not sure if its my set up in my home automation. Maybe it's just me. But overall, fantastic job by Amazon."
1,We love this option for home movies. Easy to set up and very user friendly.
1,"I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my parents. They are not tech savvy, but have been able to thrive on these. They love them."
0,The kindle fire I purchased does not work. It does not start or charge.
1,Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
1,"Makes our life easier! With music alarm, lights. Questions and answers."
0,If u have kids or just need a basic tablet this is a good 1 for starters. Only thing I dont like are the ads that show when u unlock it
1,No issues whatsoever. Works well! Best e reader there is!
1,Great tablet great quality i liked and for the price its great
1,Amazon Echo is a very good product for what it is supposed to do. It understands what you speak and does quite a few neat tricks. Setting it up is quite easy even for a novice. A thing to be desired is that it is not integrated with itunes and only with Amazon. This is a major drawback for me. You can connect your devices to it via bluetooth as workaround but that again is a additional process to undertake. I like it though and I am sure these minor things would be there in future.
1,Got it for my wife she loves it easy to read loves the fact that does not have to carry a book with. Her
1,Excellent product. Lots of upgrades to Tap since original release. A joy to use.
1,"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!"
1,"I purchased this because I was looking for a device that could stream lots of content on a TV in the garage and let me tell you, this was money well spent, lots of great apps, plenty of streaming services, perfect for anyone looking for something inexpensive but still get a lot of features!"
1,Great music and. Fun to test her knowledge. Amazing how qickly she responds to any question. Cannot stump her.
1,"This device is very easy to set up as long as you know your wifi password, Amazon account information, and a TV with an available HDMI port. FYI...You must have an Amazon account to use this device."
0,"I purchased this ereader because it stated you could get library booksvia USB cord (and Wifi if you are near one). I do not have Wifi andthe USB would not transfer. Tried everything, neighbor tried, readinstructions, viewed YouTube. But it wouldn't work. Took it back but it was beyond 15 days and they would only give me credit. I then upgraded to Wifi 3g and that better work for the extra money. Very disappointed as I felt I had no other choice."
1,"It's nice to be able to tell Alexa what you need from wherever in the house and the Echo takes care of it. Sports uodates, news, music, etc all with your voice. Very convenient."
1,Great picture and great sound. Really like the tv!
0,the tablet is okay its not like apple I pad don't cheat your self .
1,"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
1,"Compared to all other similar devices, this works really excellent."
1,Back lighting is great. Much better than the shining light you pull out. The light on our old kindle could not be dimmed at night. Lots of cool new features!
1,I used to own another kindle and I used a case with a little led light for reading before bed. Not a problem with this one!! I love that feature that I think I'm even reading more now than ever before!
1,"This is a fun piece of technology that can link into your home, I.e. Hue and nest and even your refrigerator. Love the capability but she is still limited by what other tech I have in the house. You can even have her order your groceries."
1,I like it its good for the kids to play with and easy to use.
1,This is a wonderful device and I would recommend this to anyone.
1,"When back light is off it's just like a paper. Very convenient for reading. For night, back light is so well done that still look natural."
1,You really can't go wrong here its exactly what you want out of an e reader and nothing more.
1,Went in for the firetvstick but left with this instead. If you plan on using it a lot and not planning on moving it from device to device this is the way to go. Much faster and also has SD Card inputs. We use it for Kodi and it's much faster than the firetvstick I programmed for others.
1,"excellent new piece of technology. if done again, i would have just bought the DOT(without the speaker). then bought a decent speaker and aux jacked it. speaker not worth $125 more. but its pretty awesome."
1,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
1,It even does simple math problems. Who needs a calculator when you have Alexa.
1,"I waited for weeks to get this new model and am happy I did. I love the new features on the Kindle Voyage. Didn't give it 5 stars due to some difficulty with the pressure sensitive buttons. I don't know if it is a flaw with the design or operator error, but sometimes it is more challenging than I think it should be to get the page to turn. It is far easier to swipe the screen so this is what I typically do. But, regardless. . . I love the Voyage! It was definitely worth the wait!"
1,I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
1,I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
1,Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
1,There is no doubt this is the best available e-reader in the market.I was struggling with tablet vs reader but eventually ended up with reader as it gives the best reading experience.
1,"The echo is great. Besides information,it will handle smart lights. It's learning new things all the time."
1,Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.
1,This tablet was bought as a gift for my mother. She had an older keyboard style Kindle that she really enjoyed until her new little dog got a hold of it... She seems to like this new very much. The touch screen makes using it much easier than the old keyboard style. The color display and expanded capabilities are very nice too.
1,Bought this for a gift and now buying one for myself. Very portable and easy to use.
1,"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!"
1,Works in lots of light and very minimal light. Battery seems to last a long time. Finished an entire book (Maze Runner) and the battery indicator barely went down.
1,I love the echoI'm really enjoying all of it's features!
1,Finally a perfect tablet for my son. With the addition of the memory card my son is able to play the apps he wants and still have his school apps on it! I am still able to use the parental settings to keep him safe. We all really enjoy this new Kindle and the price!!
1,Good produt
1,Love the fact i can watch amazon prime with out video to voice delay
1,I have 2 Echo dots and wanted to have a speaker with good sound quality. This is perfect.
1,The fire tv has both amazon and Netflix streaming services so it benefit everyone even when you have one one of the service.
1,Good one to configure everything ina. Easy way. Thanks
0,"The only problem that I had is that it should have been included with the Kindle Paperwhite. There is no way to charge the Paperwhite unless you buy the charger. The charging port on the Paperwhite is so small that nothing that I already have will work. Kindle does not even provide a USB cable so that you can charge from your computer. The outlet plug is cheep plastic (hollow) and will probably break, no warranty."
1,"Out of the box this is a very capable media streaming device able to stream from most all of the popular media streaming services, but once Kodi is side-loaded and configured it is unstoppable!"
1,"It is hard to beat this box. It is fast, has hardware acceleration for H264 and H265 (up to 4k) video, so it doesn't stutter, even with the highest quality videos. Android based OS easily sideloads apps like Kodi (SPMC) and Firefox browser. The remote is comfortable to use and is actually much easier to use than the current Apple TV (4th gen) remote. Having a microSDHC slot makes up for the dismal 8GB of internal storage. USB slot makes use of a standard wireless keyboard easy. I wish the homepage was more organized/customizeable like the AppleTV, but the apps and hardware itself is every bit as good IMO."
1,We only used this for music and playing games with questions with the Echo. Now we are using it to automate lighting in the home. A fun toy that has become a useful tool
1,The bright screen and lightweight design make this ereader ideal for reading in just about any setting.
1,The kindle has done everything that was in the review and great price. Very easy to use.
1,"Love my new kindle, thought the screen would be too large but after using it a few days, all is good. Very thin , got a case for it, I now feel at home with it. Do not like the ""new"" lock screen lock to open the tablet at all, its tiny and hard to ""unlock"" most always taking several times to swipe it just right."
1,good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.
1,"Every T.V in my home is running on this. Great technology, reliability and ease of use. Amazon owns this market without a doubt...had to move my appl# TV to the loft...needless to say :-)"
1,"When I bought this, I thought it was going to be yet another one of those purchases that I was going to think was a waste of money and more of a do nothing gadget that I tend to buy when I get bored, BUT boy was I surprised. We LOVE this. I find myself wishing Alexa was with me everywhere I go. Buy this... You won't no how you lived without her..."
1,tablet is so user friendly and a price you can not beat
1,Mainly purchased for my kids to watch movies on long road trips. Put in a 64gb microsd card and you have endless entertainment!
1,I use this tablet to read e-booksome and watch movies. The screen quality is great. The tablet is small enough to fit in my purse.
1,I love Alexa. She pretty much runs the whole household. Talk about smart? My favorite part is she can control the thermostat. If you're thinking of getting one she'll be waiting at Best Buy!
1,"We bought the kindle fire to replace a broken iPad 2, which was now out of date for any further updates. I love the parental controls. The case has been a savior for a few drops. My daughter loves the size of the tablet. The 2 year replacement plan and 1 year unlimited FreeSpace makes this the perfect tablet for my child. She loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. We chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space! My only complaint is that the battery life isn't anywhere near the power of an iPad. So keep your charger with you!"
1,Nice product! Can't figure how to erase messages on Alexa app.
1,It's simple to instal and use. I cannot believe how they can develop those kind of things.
1,"Husband lost first kindle fire right before Christmas, so Santa brought him this one as a replacement. He's happy! Seems to work the same as earlier model."
1,Saved money on cable. Can watch a lot of current movies.
1,My 6 year old got one last year and it's very good
0,Didn't know that Amazon had control over everything. Should have bought any other tablet.
0,Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.
1,"I bought this tablet just to keep on the side. I'm an APPLE user but for $34 bucks, you can't beat that."
1,This Amazon TV was very easy to set up. I really enjoy all the features that it has to offer. I find myself not watching cable TV as much because now I can pick and choose the type of programs I prefer to watch. The problem with cable TV other than the outrages high prices is that you are paying for channels that you never watch.
1,Best 100 bucks I've ever spent. Definitely recommend it.
1,I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
1,"I've had an iPad and iPHone for years, which also allow me to read my kindle library, but the Paperwhite has three advantages: 1) you can see it in bright sunlight, 2) the charge will last for weeks, and 3) because it is much cheaper it is less vulnerable to theft and less of a loss if it is damaged. I bought the Internet version, but it is also available with a connection to the kindle net, which enables you to download books anywhere, even where there is no access to Internet."
1,Excellent for small task and gaming for all ages .
1,"Fun to quiz, easy to set up. Still learning all of it's capabilities."
1,This is an awesome tablet. I would highly recommend it.
1,Easy to use for a beginner. This is my first tablet and I thought I'd have to take advantage of the free setup but I didn't . I love being able to take it with me so I can read while waiting places and not have to carry two books if I'm close to the end of one. I also love the camera. My personal camera was always low on battery power but now I can take my Kindle Fire with me and take photos when ever I want.
1,This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.
1,Great tablet if your looking for something easy to set up and use! !
1,"I have the second generation Kindle Paperwhite and the new Voyage is far superior to it. The resolution is much sharper, the back light is much brighter and the power button location is much more convenient. I highly recommend it."
1,I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
1,Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
1,"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product."
1,"We bought several of these and they work great! They are compact and lightweight. They have capability to add additional memory chips, too, to increase GB capacity."
1,This is a great item and one of the best prices you can get. Works well and easy to setup.
1,"Alexa recognizes most commands and questions and will tell you when she doesn't. Seems like she learns daily. We have the remote control too and it's very helpfull when Alexa is not in the room that we are in. Set up is easy and music sounds great. Shopping lists and to do lists are awesome and they appear on your smart phone via the Alexa app. Timers and alarms are useful too. Right now my complaint is Alexa cannot answer your paired smart phone yet, I read Amazon is working on this."
1,Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great
1,"If you like to read, this is an excellent choice. Battery life is weeks even with the backlight in use. Contrast is great both inside and in direct sunlight. Most municipal libraries have loads of free books in the kindle format so the device effectively pays for itself in short order."
1,This is what we were looking for. Works great. It connects easily.
0,Too slow for me. You tube don't work sometimes. Able to download some books from amazon prime.
1,"I have purchased three of these tablets. I owned one for myself and fell in love with it. I use it to watch movies, play games and for facebook. It came with under ground access to lots of free apps. I loved my fire tablet so much that I bought my two daughters each one also for xmas. I got them on black Friday. They love them so much also.. They mostly use them for netflix and youtube and to play minecraft. This is the perfect small tablet, easy to set up and use."
0,"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
1,We are still learning all the abilities of the tablet. This is new tech to us. At this point it has certainly been a good item for the money invested.
0,"Well, a good table for under $50 it's not bad. I ended getting the Toshiba 4k tv with built-in Chromecast so I need an inexpensive table so I wouldn't use my phone. Turns out that the tablet does have Play Store so i was unable to download Google Home. This tablet would be great for kids for a started tablet. you can also control how much time kids can spend on it. unfortunately it wasn't for since it didn't work for what i need."
1,Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
0,There are a lot of questions that were not answered. I just like the fact that I don't have to get up and turn off the lights.
1,"All in all it is a great product. However I find it limited by the need and expense for additional accessories. An example is you can call from it but only if the receiving person has a similar device. The sills are tricky to learn, but manageable. Some of the tasks that you ask her can be hard to get correct, it just takes some practice. All in all it is really cool."
1,Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.
1,We are still not using to the maximum ability. But my wife loves it
1,Picks up voice commands quickly. Music quality is good for the size of the device. Very handy to ask Alexia to add items to shopping list and retrieve on your cell phone.
1,This was my second one I have bought. These are not water proof
1,"This is a great tables for browsing the net, reading or listening to music. However when moving to video apps like YouTube, crunchyroll (to name a few) the video will either not play or the app won't show on the home screen. You have to do with videos provided by Bing."
1,It was easy to set up my Amazon account and I was using within minutes. Great for travel and being able to read any of my books.
1,"Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get."
1,"I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it."
1,"small and looks good on end table, good sound, wireless is great"
1,Great Tablet. My Grandson never wants to put it down. He plays it for hours and the rubber case really protects it because he is rough with it.
1,"Tablet was a Christmas gift, it is just right for the purposes mentioned"
1,I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
1,If You don't have a smart TV with built-in apps this has everything you need one package!
1,We ask Alexa questions daily. I like coming into the house and having her play music with out me finding the remote.
1,He loves to read his books through this kindle. Not to complicated and easy to use.
1,"I've avoided an e-reader as my tablet served well. When Amazon released this new Kindle Fire for $50, I thought, why not? I'm traveling a lot and it's nice and compact.Whoa! It also doubles as a tablet, as far as being able to access Internet, email, other things; the Amazon app (I can't remember the name, but it's pre-installed) has hundreds of free--yes, free--apps.I'm delighted to the point I've now purchased two more as gifts. I did add an SD card to increase storage space, but that was minor. Great product; excellent buy!"
1,Bought this tablet last year and is still working fine! Definitely not an iPad but does a lot of things that an iPad can do! Would purchase this product again.
1,"I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my children to learn on, and found that they had dropped the price of the Kindle Fire to $50. This is an unbelievable price for a tablet with this many features."
1,It's simple to use and I've had no issues. Do need decent internet speed to stream live tv.
1,bought for my niece for Christmas and she love it. cost effective and does what she need it too. Play games an read.
1,Bought one because my brother in law had one and I'm still learning new thing ls to do with it
1,great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
1,"I love my new tablet. The size is just right and love that I can access the internet or play games anytime, anywhere!"
0,"Small table for a small price comparable to other tablet options on the market but not as user-friendly as I'd hoped. I prefer Samsung and the Google Playstore. Initial set up took a while citing the table to could not locate WIFI but it was on an accessible and in use by other devices at the same moment with accessibility for the Fire tablet to also connect. Eventually it connected but the ability to use the tablet, functions, tools, etc with ease was disappointing to myself (adult) and child I purchased it for. However it's a great ""first-time"" tablet and priced well."
1,Excellent device. Great for reading on the go.reading settings for more than one reader.
1,"I like how easy is to watch movies, tv shows, and also play video games in this fire tv device i like it and really recommend this to anybody!"
1,"Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money."
1,"Really cool, not using near all the features so far but hope to add soon!"
1,we bought the amazon fire for my daughter. works great
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite does one thing and does it incredibly well. It's a great way to read books. The screen is wonderful in bright light and the backlight's great for reading in bed without disturbing your partner. If you're a reader, this is a no-brainer."
1,"Works great, but should have been included with the purchase of the Kindle not 20 more dollars."
0,Great tablet for the price. Not really for reading books.
1,"This is one of the best purchases I made a long time ,"
1,My son is little standoff y Alexa... other then that we like it.
1,"This item is light downloads come in fast , built great and has a lot of bells and whistles too . Great for beginners and kids ."
1,Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
1,"This is my first streaming video device, and I did a good bit of research before buying. The video quality is excellent and the operator interface is easy to use."
1,The Amazon Echo is their response to Siri in stereo. It has terrific voice recognition and constantly learns new things. The only shortcoming is that it doesn't play nicely with iTunes.
1,Great sound quality. Love all the functions that it has.
1,"Pros: Light, easy to set-up if you have an Amazon account, parental control, good use for little ones, excellent camera qualityCons: Touchscreen can be sensitive at times"
1,this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
1,"Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it!"
0,Nice kids tablet for a decent price. I bought it for a road trip.
1,"Alexa does all that was described. It is like having an assistant who selects your music, makes a shopping list and even buys things I need. She tells jokes too!"
1,Tablet is a good tablet not the best for games or apps but decent especially for the price
1,"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch.."
1,I love the tablet so does my 2 year old she watches her shoes all day long on it its very user friendly
1,"Not as good as Roku but still a good product. Started using it and kind of liking it. For $70 bucks, I think it is a good price and product"
1,It work great the first time and just bought my 2nd for a different location. The cord is that much closer to being cut.
1,"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books...."
0,Netflix app runs great no buffering and good HD quality. Amazon app and movies have their issues. But overall I like my fire tv. If only Amazon ran like Netflix then would be 5 stars.
1,Great price. Bottom of device has shadows where the lights are that is a little annoying. Not sure why they can't avoid this. Doesn't interfere with the reading experience.
1,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas has been s good tablet for her
1,I brought this tablet for my 64 year old granddad and he loves it he says it's very easy to use and sends me pictures all the time of what ever he is cooking at watching lol
1,"Works great and exactly as a tablet should. Awesome price at Best Buy! Keep in mind there are certain apps that aren't compatible with Amazon, so check it out beforehand at the store, but if you can DO without those apps then its perfect for anyone ."
1,Really love it. Great display but not crazy about ads but still getting use to it.
1,"Love this tablet, great price and is really fast. Is worth every penny."
1,Works excellent...............................................
1,"I paid about 33% less than the going price for this. I can't complain for any reason on this based on what was paid. Is it the perfect tablet, well, there are some limitations, however, I've paid far more in the past for comparable tablets that didn't offer any more than this. I picked up multiple ones and they are scattered through the house and all being put to use."
1,I bought this tablet for my grand daughter. She loves it! Her parents and I love the fact that she uses it to read books. Perfect!
1,This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.
1,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models."
0,"The Kindle line is great for easily syncing into existing Amazon accounts & it's a great tablet for basic functions, like internet use, video streaming, music streaming, apps, etc.etc.etc. However, the tablet cannot currently stream downloaded movies from Ultraviolet, which is a pain for most users that primarily bought this device for that purpose. I would currently not recommend the purchase of this device until you find out that Amazon has fixed the issue, if one of your criteria(s) for the perfect tablet is to be able to watch downloaded movies!"
1,This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase
1,Works as it should. Finally cut the cord! No more cable bills!!!!
1,"I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
1,She was happy about it and can't get enough of this tablet
0,"This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!"
1,"Although I am satisfied and happy with my purchase, it was slimmer and longer than I'd expected."
0,Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.
0,"Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :)."
1,"Fairly easy to set up. Once running, it was fun to begin seeing what Alexa could do. I look forward to using it every day. My wife uses it more than I, loves to listen to C&W music while sewing."
1,Echo is wonderful. It understands spoken language very well. I love how it's compatible with IFTTT. It can do just about anything.
1,This is a great tablet for small children and for anyone who is looking to use it for a reading tablet or the internet. It is a bit slow but not to the point where it is frustrating.
1,"Very easy setup. Excited about receiving, rave reviews from other owners"
1,Just as expected...The Amazon Echo performs great and is an excellent product to add on to a connected home.
1,I purchased this tablet for my little (3) son for Christmas and he loves it.
1,Great assistant and fun to use. Keeps my shopping list and controls my hue lights.
1,Awesome! Really small size and fits perfect without taking a lot of space on the entertainment rack. Love it so far! 4K is awesome and definitely recommended! Make sure you are using the HDMI port specifically for HDCP 2.2 on your TV.
1,I love the Tablet. It was for a gift but I have purchased a few of them..
1,I had a 3 year old Roku stick which was a lot better than broadcast antenna service but with the Roku stick I often waited through long pauses while the data was buffering. The Fire TV (2015 model) is a small box on my flat screen TV stand which provides a fast friendly interface to fast streaming entertainment and almost no buffering waits. I like the small tapered remote control which is light and easy to hold and point while browsing the many options. Amazon offers Prime members a very large array of entertainment and learning selections to enjoy.
0,Poor choice The product did not work after only one week it froze on me and I was unable to get it to go to the factory reset I would not recommend this product at this time I will call Amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line I see that this is a common problem a problem that they should solve
1,It's a cool gadget. My kids love to ask Alexa to tell them a joke or play them a song. I enjoy having Alexa set a alarm when needed as I'm bad about charging my phone which would be my usual form of alarm otherwise.
1,Works great. Battery starting to lower easier about 8 months into purchasing
1,Smaller overall size with the same screen size of our older kindle fire. Faster processor.
1,"The kindle fire is a good little tablet. Good battery life, easy to use, just wish amazon would add the play store to their tablets but other than that it is a good tablet."
1,"You can't get a better tablet for the price. Bought it for my kid, and for the price don't have to worry about damage. Can watch videos, play some games. Overall good purchase."
1,"Was about to purchase another tablet for more money else where when another shopper informed me of the Kindle Fire being available at Best Buys for $49. Was able to purchase a name brand tablet for less. I was all in. Going to Best Buys to make the purchase was well worth the trip and the price. The Kindle Fire has not let me down to date. I can read books, google, read my email and most things I can do on my computer."
1,Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
1,Surprised how powerful this little thing is. Easy to use and setup was a breeze.
1,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
1,Great tablet and very easy to use. Also good battery life.
1,"This is the second tablet I've purchased aimed for little ones and it's by far the best. Easy to access his games and plenty of preloaded games, videos and apps. It makes road trips so much happier!"
1,Happy with the echo it is a really good device. Will recommend it to others
1,"Oh my goodness! I cannot imagine what I did BEFORE I had my Alexa Echo (and I now own 3 Dots around the house). I am always asking questions, setting alarms and timers and playing great music! Works perfectly for me and she understands almost everything say but I have a very distinct, clear voice and of course, it's all in how you word what you are asking for. LOVE IT!"
0,I thought Alexa was like your smart phone Siri but it's not. It's very limited to what you can ask and you must download some of the Apps in within the Alexa app to work and ask question. Not what I though it was.
1,"This is a great entry tablet, if you do not want to dish out a few hundred dollars you should look into a fire table."
1,I picked this up for my dad as a early Christmas gift after he liked using my Echo. Great price and he loves it!
1,The unit seems to have a sturdy build and it loads and unloads very quickly
1,This product is great my family love it. We would recommend this to anyone
1,I've enjoyed using the features Alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers. The sound quality is good.
1,"This product is so fun! We got it for my Dad for his birthday and he hooked it up right away and everyone had fun trying to stump Alexa! Also, we played every type of music, and she got information on a restaurant for us and you can control volume and everything by voice command. It is the first ""robot"" we have in our home!! Highly recommend this product. I am buying another one today!"
1,"I have enjoyed my friend's Echo before and her kids love to talk with Alexa. Decided to purchase one for my own household and as an added perk, it was on sale for the holidays!"
1,Simple to setup and use. Would love to see more Google integration.
0,Wanted to connect to Google play store. Limited to Amazon.good for shopping.
1,"This was the perfect gift for my daughter. She can play games, watch movies and browse YouTube. Now I can officially have my phone back."
1,"Bought one for my wife and I...I got the white one, she got the black one. Started reading through Stephen King's entire bibliography. Really loving it, and really loving the device. Great battery life and functionality. Highly recommended. If you are thinking about buying one, just do it. You won't regret it. And make sure to set up your local library digital account to rent books for free!"
1,So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
1,I admit I am late to the Kindle party. I couldn't understand why someone would get a dedicated e-reader when other devices could do so much more. I am now convinced that this is the way to read a book. The battery life is incredible and the paperwhite display is so easy on the eyes. The device is also a great size and can be used one handed without feeling cumbersome.
1,"This is a great product! The voice controls are great and works no matter how loud the music is playing. It's almost as if everything on the internet is at your finger tips, ready to be accessed!"
1,I love the fire box. All of my shows are easily accessible.
1,Awesome product... I really liked this product....
1,Great item to have but a little more than the fire stick
1,Amazing tablet does everything I need it to do wow!
1,"This is my second fireTV that I purchased. It is very user friendly with plenty of apps. I use about 4 on a regular basis and the streaming is fantastic. With the extra ram, little to no buffering.Highly Recommended"
1,The initial novelty of it was great. Had a good week of asking Alexa random questions and getting her to update me on random news and weather. Calling my friends was easy and useful when i was cooking or otherwise had dirty hands.
1,Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
1,I was impressed with the quality I got for the price. I would recommend this product ti others.
1,We dropped our cable company and now have the fire stick . We are saving money and don't miss the cable company one bit!!!!
1,Works great! Love how I can use this with my alarm system. We love Alexa
0,"I ended up returning it after 15 days. The browser was too slow. I bought so I wouldn't have to look stuff up on my phone all the time. Ended up being slow, so I just ended up always using my phone."
1,I am extremely satisfied with this streaming device. I was not sure if it was for me but the FireTv has all the processor speed that I have needed and with Sling TV I was able to drop my TV service provider.
1,Works great with our 4K tv. Upgraded from firestick and can really see the difference
1,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.
1,Easy to use and easy to navigate through everything.
1,"There is nothing else I can say about this product except that it is an excellent gadget to have around the house. You want to hear music, have a question about the weather, Trivia, sports, etc. Just ask Alexa."
1,Good device4k video is niceGreat supportNegative point is doesn't have Browser and cach issue low space.
1,Love my FireTablet !! A must have if you have Amazon Prime.
1,Love A&&le TV but seems like all is based on spending money. This device gives you lots of options and lets you select with voice as well as is in UHD.
1,Bought this for my grand daughter. Very easy to navigate. A very good price. No problems at all
0,"Many of our questions to her she miss interpreted or replied as not understanding what we were looking for. Distance for her to hear us was minimal. I returned this one and purchased the ""Google"" and this one is much better and more knowledgeable with answers. Both devices recommend using the phone app and also making other purchases for more usage of items that may be available. I didn't expect additional charges and so I'm not to thrilled with either one but I did keep the Google device in hopes of better to come in the future."
1,"I bought this tablet for my son. It's the perfect size for him. It does everything any tablet, or smartphone (minus calling/texting) can do. And you can't beat the price for a name brand tablet."
1,Love this product so much that I have purchased 3 now
1,"Like it, this product is very powerful and useful."
1,I Brought this item for grandsons. They love them.
1,"This Amazon Fire has some nice features that my old Kindle Fire HD did not, like a camera and microphone for video chat. I wish that its keypad would do swiping, though. I miss that and am not as happy with the autofill on this model. Overall, though, it operates well. The browser could be a little faster."
1,"I love the Amazon Echo! I am using it everyday from turning on/off the lights, to listening to music, to sending me reminders. It is a must have!"
1,"As the title says, the tablet isn't bad for the price, good enough for books and just browsing the internet."
1,kids love it...only issue that bothered me is that my reduced price came with ads that in order to be removed i had to pay money. other than that good product
1,My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad!
0,Works great for my 6 year old grandson! he loves it.
1,"It is easy to use and very handy,light. I got it for my mom."
1,This item was very easy to hook up and use. There are a variety of free movies to watch.
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is user friendly, light and easy to hold. I would highly recommend this electronic reader to anyone."
1,I bought this for my husband. He really likes it much better than I thought he would.
1,"Love this amazon echo , answers questions, plays my music , even manages lights in the house ! Love it !"
1,"This is a great item to own in your home. So you can entertain friends, family, and yourself!!!"
1,I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!
1,Take it out of the box and it is basically ready to assist any questions you throw it way. Lots of fun and a great way for quick information.
1,Bought this one as a Christmas gift. Employee was very excited to receive and still loves the tablet.
1,Camera was perfect for my daughter... she's in yearbook at school and fell in love with it...
1,Love my Echo! Great skills and more coming online every day!
1,"Great for reading books, surfing social media, lots of apps and games to enjoy!"
1,I am very satisfly with product and service provide
1,Does the job
1,"Overall, this product works great on non-smart tvs; very easy to install."
1,I've owned firesticks in the past but the speed on the fire tv box is definitely much faster! Very happy.
1,Bought this for my mother who is 84. Excellent tablet for the beginner.
1,wanted for email/streaming video /audio great price
1,It gets the job done and I like it. It's really good for little kids as well
1,"Do we really yet another review of the device? I suppose not.So here is a comment about my buying experience at bestbuy. In one word a breeze. And that too at a substantial discount, thanks to Visa checkout."
1,It's so easy to use and fun! I watch shows on Netflix and MTV apps
0,"Works fine, don't like the ads. Easy to use speed ok."
0,"It kept freezing when I first hooked it up. I couldn't type anything in because it kept resetting. After a couple days it started working, when I was ready to return it, so I decided to keep it. Need to be patient with it."
1,"I love it, It is by far way better than Apple TV and Chromecast!"
1,It's a great tablet for my nine year old. She does her homework on it.
1,I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos.
1,"I had read that the tablet supported gps, for Pokmon go. You can make Pokmon go work, but this tablet does not have built in gps, it uses wifi triangulation. It is great for watching movies, YouTube, and social media apps. It's also great for reading books."
1,We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great.
1,Bought for my wife as a birthday gift. She absolutely loves it!!!
1,This is a great e reader. There is no glare it is easy on the eyes.
1,"I already reviewed this once. But does doing this mean I get more reward points? Of course I spend $1400.00 there the other day, and still haven't seen any certificates from it, so not sure the points are worth anything anyway."
1,Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
1,Small unit provides excellent quality and portability is a huge plus.
1,Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems
1,"The Amazon Echo continues to advance its capabilities becoming more and more of a benefit. I mostly use it for playing music, but it has many fine uses."
1,very easy set up and no issues with it starting to work. going to get proper light switches so it can turn my lights on and off
1,"This is my second kindle purchase. The first is still working fine just not backlit or paper white. The clarity is great, good size, and lightweight for extended reading. No bells and whistles, just easy and convenient reading."
1,You can barely find these in the store now i know why fast smooth tv and movie streaming great for games too
1,My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
0,Not a big fan of Amazon fire tabs...got one as gift from grandparents and it memory on 8GB gets full too quick and no way to expand
1,"Great product. I purchased it for its Playstation Vue and HBO Now streaming capabilities, as well as its ability to stream 4k programming. Nice if paired with an Amazon Prime subscription."
1,I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.
1,Bought 3 Amazon fire tablet on Black Friday and the family love it
1,"Awesome and very cheap, but would recommend!!! Awwwwwwww"
1,"I love the Amazon Fire TV. I chose it over the the Fire Stick because I have 4K TVs.The picture is crystal clear. You need a strong Internet signal in order to Strem Effectively without all the buffering.This is a great option if you are tired of cable or just don't enjoy paying the high prices. You can access your favorite streaming Apps. (Hulu, Netflix, etc.)"
1,Purchase went smoothly and the ability to use American Express award points at checkout was a plus.
1,"Got this for only $90. Really great deal for this machine. I just love to read, and it is more fun reading with this Kindle. I have been waiting for deals like this for a long time and will buy another one as a gift next time the deal is on."
1,I have dabbled in the market for a inexpensive tablet for a while and found this and boy am I glad I did. Tablet runs faster than I thought and has a very good display. If you can't afford an Ipad get this!
1,"The Amazon Fire TV box is the best choice for your money. It runs smoothly, it's user friendly and it has a great user interface. It has 2gb of memory which is a plus, and it allows you to connect directly to your modem via Ethernet. I find this especially helpful when you are having issues with your wifi or you have many devices in your home connected to your wifi. I have not had any issues with this box!"
1,We got rid of cable so we bought this. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I do not miss cable at all!! My husband & I love it!!
1,This is a unique item with nice features. You can add Items to a shopping list by just telling Alexa to . You can have her turn on or off your lights
1,Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly
1,I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
1,Bought this for my son in Christmas and it was worth the price. Get the protective cover on Amazon. Great for kids and anyone who enjoys reading
1,Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.
1,"Excellent purchase, satisfied my needs for entertaining television!"
1,I love having more books with less weight! I also love the way I can read at night!
1,I got this tablet for one of my cousin's kids who is really enjoying this so far.
1,I bought the tablet for my 2 year old as a birthday present. I downloaded the apps I thought he would enjoy and handed it to him. He caught on to some really quick while others hes still a little young. Overall the quality and durability is excellent.
1,I had seen Alexa in action a few weeks ago and recently made this purchase. She has been a great addition to our family! My next move is to control other devices in the home.
1,Love it...plays the music I enjoy and gives me up to date reports
1,"I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration."
1,Easy to navigate. Color is good. Duarable. My son has had many fun hours playing with it
1,"was not sure what to expect as im generally not too savvy with technology. this amazon echo product is fairly easy to get started using and can be really helpful when you are multi tasking. I normally don't have a free hand and when you cant have your tablet with you at all times, the amazon echo fills that void quickly. I would suggest everyone with the internet to have one of these in their homes."
1,Very sceptical about getting the amazon tv box but once i decided to get it the family and i were releived that we bought the box. It has many functions and apps including hulu and netflix. A must buy!!!
1,This tablet has great storage capacity. I have downloaded all kinds of children's movies and learning activities. It's great.
1,"I have had this product for about a year now, and I am still very pleased with my purchase. I am able to read books, surf the web, listen to music, watch videos, and more. Unbelievable price for everything you can do on this tablet."
1,Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
1,This has been one of the best tech gadgets I have ever purchased. It takes some patience in learning what to say. Easy though.
1,Kids love their tables we bought two and the Warrenty was great when the cord broke on one...
1,The Kindle Paperwhite is easy to use and great for reading outdoors.
1,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite."
1,I love watching FiOS on this tablet! I like that I can check my emails and go onfacebook at the same time.
1,My grandson loved it! Shipping was lightning fast!Thank you!
1,Chose this tablet due to the parental control features as a gift for my granddaughter.
1,"I am a huge fan of Alexa and it is because of the dot. The Echo is great also but the size makes it a little bit more intrusive. The only benefit of the Echo over the Dot is the speaker quality. If that is the most important thing for you - then go for the Echo. Otherwise, I would suggest looking at the Dot. The Echo picks up your voice two rooms away. Setting it up couldn't be easier and it links quickly to HUE, VEMO and many other products. Highly recommended."
1,I got one for each of my grandsons! Great for long car rides-download movies from Amazon Prime
1,Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
1,This is one of the coolest new inventions around. It is very innovative and works great. It's really neat asking Alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored.
1,"Very smooth operating system and easy to use for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc"
1,"We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!"
1,Have 2 Echo's and 1 Dot located in out two homes. Love all of them...very versatile and provide needed information and entertainment when and as needed. Very useful and cost effective.
1,My husband needed a new kindle and he can do so much with it.
1,Mom really love it for Christmas. Easy for her to use.
1,This was the perfect gift to my wife when she felt she needs to start reading now
1,"Got this for my 7 year old daughter, she loves it. We read on it, she plays on it, there are videos on it, and she can't or hasn't found a way to break it yet. Well done Amazon, well done."
1,The paper white is a fantastic e reader with many great features not found on most of the competitors
1,"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
1,"If you're looking to buy a firetv then this is the one. It's faster, better opitions, ethernet port and plenty of storage."
1,"Works great like it should plenty of apps and more, great graphics"
1,"Out of all the other media sources, this is my favorite one. It's a lot user friendly, and has more options to do things with this media device."
1,"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone."
1,"I've had two previous generations of Kindles, but always found myself longing for the old hardcover. No more... This is perfect for my needs. Can read outside or in a darkened room. For approximately $100, it can't be beat."
1,Easy to find different apps on the Amazon fire box.
1,"I like that I can sync my email and now, actually use the Prime streaming video service. Yes, I know I could use the app on my Ipad, but like I said, I like it all packaged neatly here."
1,bought it for my son. he likes it. very good alternate to expensive tables out there.
1,"Its cheap. and on Black Friday I got it even cheaper. Its not a competitor for iPad, but I do pretty basic things on my new Kindle tablet, so I am OK with this purchase. Nothing that impressed me"
1,"Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read."
1,"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
1,I got this box's for a gift and they love it and for that price can't beat that
1,"I am not a ""techie"" but I love the Kindle Fire. It is easy to use and of high quality. It is an amazing value compared to other readers."
1,"Not much else to say, except this device replaced my aging Apple TV, I thought I'd give it a shot as Prime is not available (yet) on apple TV. However, this device's sharp picture, reliability and nearly endless number of apps is absolutely outstanding!!"
1,"I love the Amazon echo. It a great device for finding answers to questions or listening to music. On side note it is a great learning tool for a grade school student. Love playing 20 questions, getting the local weather report and keeping shopping lists."
1,Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
1,This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.
1,Works great for the price. I use it mainly to watch videos or read newspaper/magazine articles. For much else it would be too slow.
1,This tablet is perfect for kids and adults for me if I was the owner I wouldn't want a little bit more memory and ram but that's why I own a laptop now it has an interface that allows you to set up a profile for a kid individually That's what makes it perfect for kids and you control. It also has latest and greatest apps exc. It runs games ok but movies stream well and really for me this is great I have 4 girls from ages 10 to 4 and they all have something and this one is the best of all of them.
1,"Music (great sound), news, sports updates, commute condition and a whole lot more! The nice thing is more available content is consistently coming out. What a versatile, fun piece of electronics!"
1,The Fire TV has changed the way we watch television. We no longer have expensive cable and don't miss it at all
1,I recently bought this for my son who HP tablet died on him a month before I got him the Fire. Best thing I've done!! It didn't cost a lot and it's made solid with beautiful deep colors and smooth video playback. I'm seriously thinking of buying one for myself soon. If you are looking for a tablet to play games and watch movies this the perfect little travel mate for you.
1,"Not a bad tablet, BUT not an amazing tablet. It costs 50 dollars for a reason. It is a basic tablet, kind of like having a bigger iPhone 3, if you get the reference."
1,This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.
1,The paper white is versatile e reader easy to read in all light and has great battery life
1,"I was afraid that having an electronic book would take away from the feeling of ""unplugging."" However, this was not the case. This kindle really looks like a book page. It is much lighter than a book and i can take it anywhere. Love love love this product!"
1,Very easy to set up. Sound is really good. The microphone works well and Alexa is responsive. Great Assistant.
0,"Mainly use for music and to-do/shopping lists. Inquiries about basic information are answered with accuracy, but more complex questions (""describe the limbic system"", etc) are not answered. Sound is average.If you are looking for in depth answers, this device will disappoint you. Great for fairly common stuff."
1,I bought 2 of these tables for the daycare center and they are just great to work with and the children love them.
1,wanted to keep up to date on latest technology ...
1,Great value for price. Can add a 64gb card for almost unlimited storeage. Can download video & audio to play offline.
1,"Alexa WRECKS Siri...faster, smarter, and understands complex questions. Picture it this way, who would you rather receive an answer from: A high-schooler or a pre-schooler. That's the difference. No, really. When Best Buy puts this on sale for $139 - grab one! Setup is cake, it's got phenomenal wi-fi reception and is really handy. New ""Skills"" - basically third-party plugins - add functionality to the Alexa products weekly. If you've owned an ultra-lame Fire device, don't be gun-shy, the Echo rocks. The only caveat is the speaker is just good. Not great. But good enough for room-filling sound. If you have you're own stereo system, consider the Dot."
1,Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading
0,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly."
1,Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.
1,"Got this tablet for my kids(ages 3 to 8). Really good starter tablet with excellent parental controls on it. Does not necessarily have all the bells and whistles, but still an excellent tablet, especially for the kids!"
1,Made my life simple and every app i ever needed is all in one place
1,Gave as a gift to my mother. She is highly pleased with it.
1,"I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iPhone"" and ""for Android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!"
1,"Fun to use and play with. Answers questions very quickly,"
1,easy to read has good read on it battery lasts able to load many more books
1,"For what the Kindle Fire does, at $50, it's practically a steal. The reason why I bought the Fire was because it's excellent 'Read Aloud' function. There are many books that do not come in Audiobook format, which I need- I don't have as much time as I would like to sit down and read these days. The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. Battery lasts pretty wellBad Points:The Fire's OS could use some reworking- switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.All in all, it's a great buy at $50!"
1,overall pretty good sometimes the device shut off you might need to contact amazon
1,Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!
1,The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
1,"I USE THE ECHO FOR MUSIC, GAMES, TRIVIA, AND FOR SMART LIGHTING. IT'S AWESOME ."
1,Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with.
1,"Alexa is great; however, since we have a couple lamps hooked up through Vivint; we ask her to turn them on and off. No matter how clearly or different ways we say it; she often gets confused as to which lamp to turn on/off or anything at all."
1,We love the Amazon Echo. We are still finding new ways to use it.
1,"I think it is a great product, although I could not say whether Fire TV is better than Apple TV. Fire TV is better with the Amazon movies and shows, while Apple TV is directly through the iTune store for movies and shows."
1,"I am so impressed with all the things this little tablet can do. It's NOT just an eReader, although that's what I purchased it for. The clarity is so improved from my old Kindle Fire, which I dearly loved for years (until my puppy got it). I was flabbergasted at all the things this little tablet can do...and it was so much less expensive than my other tablet. WHAT A DEAL!"
1,"Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
1,I'm so happy I can stream movies from my amazon prime account
1,I purchased this for my mom in hopes that she would learn to email. We are still working on it but the tablet is good for basic needs and the price was great.
1,Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun!
0,I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.
1,"I'm truly elated with the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet. I originally purchased this product specifically to attached to my Tablet Holder on my Nordic Track Treadmill, which already has a built-in tablet. However, I was so taken back by the versatility of the Fire HD 8 tablet that I decided to use the tablet as my everyday ""walk-about"" computer tablet instead on placing on my treadmill which I only use 1 to 3 times per week. I totally recommend the Fire HD 8 Tablet which on sale cost about $69.00."
1,"Have you considered buying a kindle for your kids? This is the one to get. Anything else and you're over spending. Pros:Great app selectionGreat free apps due to UndergroundExtremely affordableSD card supportCons:Bad storage management - when you run out of internal space, the device stops functioning correctly!"
1,"I bought this for a family member who has very limited use of her hands due to a spinal cord injury. She lives in a nursing facility. My hope was that she could enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcasts of her favorite sports team simply by speaking to the Echo/Alexa device. My big concern was that she would not be able to use the voice commands due to her weak voice.Happily, I can report that she loves it and is able to successfully use the voice commands. We have it sitting on her night stand about two feet next to her. And I know that she loves it not only because she tells me but because I can see, using the Alexa app on my smartphone, each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day. I can even listen to the audio of each of her interactions with the device. And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day!So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible.This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day. My aunt hopes that a future update will allow it to control her TV and make/receive phone calls."
1,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.
1,"No problems, correct output."
1,I like the definition but the software has bugs. I had to return mine.
1,"I purchased this item, along with an HD antenna to finally cut the cable. Prices were getting out of control with the cable monopoly. This product really delivers. All the entertainment you could possibly want at your fingertips. I use it to stream PlayStation Vue. After experimenting with all devices. I feel this is by far the best. As smooth as a PS4, but easier to navigate with the remote. I also use it to stream Netflix as well as some of the free content. Overall an easy to use great product"
1,Great for my girls. These tablets are great for smart 7 and 8 year old children.
1,"By buying my Kindle Paperwhite, I was able to download my college text books for less money then if I had bought them at the Campus store."
1,"It is light to hold. It does work great in the sunlight, which is the reason I bought this product. I used the Kindle app on other devices."
1,Bought for daughter who reads in the dark. She loves it!
1,this is my second kindle. I would be lost without it. It is so convenient to just throw in my purse and take it along wherever I go. I love it.
1,"Purchased several of these tablets for my nieces and nephews during Black Friday. Got them for a great price! They are great for the kids, only caveat is the storage space, 8GB, which is not much when you start downloading game apps but you can buy a MICROSD card to expand the storage. So far it's been useful for watching videos, browsing internet, and playing games. I have Amazon Prime so there are other benefits that you can access on this tablet with Prime. The only negatives I can think of are the storage space, the camera is not the best quality (but not why I bought it) and you can only use it with WiFi. So far loving it and glad I bought it."
1,"Haven't tried anything but playing music and the radio. Have two Echoes in the house. When I hooked this new one up, the other one came on. Can't quite figure our how to work them separately. May have to go back to Best Buy and ask one of your assistants."
1,Excellent media streaming device. Could easily take the place of about 4 different boxes under your television.
1,Does what it's supposed to. Fine for reading or watching video. But I was anticipating it having a swype keyboard (my earlier gen kindle has one) and it doesn't. Ended up having to buy a a Bluetooth keyboard so I can use it to type notes at work.
1,I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view.
1,My nephews use their tablet all the time. It's durable and pretty fast. They love it.
1,"What a fun new helper and fun accessory to use around the house. Plays music, plays games with you , orders pizza and much much more...."
0,"fully understand this is a budget tablet, but the memory size and quality of screen are not to par"
1,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
1,"Gotta love the character that Echo's Alexa has. She can be snarky from time to time depending on what you ask her. There are a bunch of connectivity features for home automation I have not even been able to touch, yet...I use it for free music streaming by telling her to play a certain genre of music. It's fun to have around! Lots of commands to try out... :)"
1,"I bought this item for my granddaughter for her birthday,, she really liked it.."
1,"The FIRE goes where you go. The greatest attribute is the size, perfect to bring everywhere!!"
0,"Works well enough but is outstanding for the price, just be wary of the operating system you could poetically download an android emulator that would make this a 4/5 instantly"
1,"Not much to say as this is a wonderful reader, probably best yet. Bought 3 as gifts this year."
0,Charge the device and was able to set up everything and when I came back to use it it would not work
1,I bought this as a birthday gift for my 9 year old daughter. Great gift and good quality! She hasn't put it down yet!
1,I love this. We love to travel and now I can download a bunch of books to read on our trips. Now that I have this I don't know how I survived those long flights without it.
1,"My 81 yo mothers loves to be able to adjust lighting levels with voice commands through integration with Philips Hue devices, and my 84 yo dad laughs every time Alexa does as she is told and says ""OK"""
1,This was a super deal! I love my Kindle and can't believe I got a tablet so inexpensive.
1,Got it for my wife and she loves it. Very convenient for travel.

1,"Does everything I expected, it was very easy to hook up"
1,"If I would have known how wonderful this was to read with I wouldn't have purchased and Ipad. I love this to read whenever, wherever. If you're a reader this is the best ereader."
1,Everything was great. The actual item is holding up to our little ones expectations as well as mine ! This is definitely something that we would encourage everyone else to purchase as well. It's pretty fast and simple!
1,"Very power full box, great for streaming 4K look beautiful."
1,"Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one."
1,"Great little gadget, works well with my smart home. I can now turn on lights, etc. with voice commands. Feels like Star Trek! Love how Alexa plays music as well, and she understands most commands. It's fun to have a digital assistant around!"
1,It works!
1,"Alexa has a great deal of knowledge. If you have music on your phone, she can play it or you need to purchase either amazon prime or music unlimited."
1,Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite is moe like reading a book page rather than reading on LCD screen.
1,Pretty cool just which it und we stood more commands
1,So far I have bought three of these of tablets and they love it
1,"Simply the best to watch tv series and movies. It works even better if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber, with access to a many free goodies."
1,I wasn't sure about Alexa echo but it was so worth it! We love it and use it all the time.
1,I bought this for my kids and very happy with that.
1,An amazing piece of equipments! Does many entertaining things.
1,"We had recently purchased a home w/ speakers thruout but needed to add a receiver. In the meantime, we heard about the Echo and thought it might be fun and also provide a means to have music in our pool room. The sound is so good, we have decided to not spend a lot of money to run the speaker system in the house! The set up was well documented and had no problem getting ""Alexa"" up and running in a short amount of time."
1,Nice little tablet. Touch sensitivity not as great as high end tablet but definitely worth the trade off in price.
1,"I love this tablet,I use it for school readings ,for my philosophy class , my Mac book is to delicate to take to school,but my fire tablet is perfect !"
1,"Great and easy to use, showed me how to set up the tablet"
1,"My mom asked for this and she loves it, we are looking at the nest next."
1,I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.
1,"Very handy gadget, Performs well,a little difficult to get used to the commands and setting up music!"
1,This is the 3rd Paperwhite I've purchased... for me and as gifts. Absolutely love them!

1,Price is great for the purchase and the quality of the picture is great

1,Great little speaker and love the free month of Amazon unlimited
1,"It is very easy to read, no glare at all, easy to get up and going."
1,I bought this for my son to use on his dream vacation and he loves it.
1,Easy to use and well lit for night reading. Charges fast. Light weight. Love it!
1,"Picked up this tablet for my kid, the price was very appealing. My kid loves the tablet, does everything a more expensive table to would do."
1,"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
1,Gets the job done
0,Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.
1,Pretty good tablet not great but still solid for the price
1,for something so small it has enough processing power to do what it needs to for a travel reader. graphics are also decent for the size.
1,"My wife and I love our kindles because they're great out in the sun on cruises, at the beach or when sitting on the couch."

1,"I purchased this for my nephew, great activities, and more for him to learn."
1,This is a fairly standard item for use with wall/standard US AC plugs. It is well designed and will meet your charging needs when connected to the required USB cable.
1,"I can't believe it's so cheap now. I had the previous model and it was great. I mostly use it for reading, but it's great that you can add other apps to pass the time."
1,This fire was easy to set up and easy to use for emails and Internet .
1,Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
1,Love white background and. back lighting. Much easier to read than earlier models
1,This works well and is a great way to keep up on news. Works well with smart home items.
1,the product is great for 4k tvs and normal tvs for the price its pretty good
1,"I GOT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDSON, HE LOVES IT!!!"
1,Expandable memory up to 128gb. Amazon kindle/prime benefits. Small portable options with stylish accessories from a name brand as opposed to some unknown Chinese alternative. I choose Amazon everyday of every week at this price point.
0,I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
1,"My husband bought this forme as a ""surprise""Christmas gift.I love the information Alexa provides and her assistance with my shopping list."

1,This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
1,Best streaming device. For the price better than Apple TV
1,This reader is a great way at a low price to feed your newspaper habit. I save $50 per month on just one newspaper.
1,"For what it's worth, it does what it needs to do!!"
1,The PaperWhite is a great reader. Nice to read in the sun! Nice to read indoors. Very happy.
1,"Aside from all it's other capabilities I've yet to learn, my FAVORITE thing about the Echo is telling Alexa to add items to my shopping list then once I'm at the store I'm able to pull up my list on my Alexa app. No more sloppy grocery lists, no more accidentally leaving them at home. Best part is if I realize I'm about to run out of something while cooking, I just tell Alexa to add it to my shopping list without even having to pick up a pen or my phone!"
1,I lied the shows it offer. I really like the ease of installation
1,Got this for my son. It's not top quality but for $50 it's not bad
1,Great value for the money. Good for checking email and browsing from time to time.
0,"Don't know I bought as gift for my nephew, we will see."
1,I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
1,We had an earlier version of Kindle that in my opinion was hard to read the print. We purchased the Kindle paperwhite and love the brightness. It's much easier to read and doesn't strain my eyes.
1,Great graphics for price compared to other brands.
1,This kindle is so sharp and turns pages quickly. I can finish books quickly and store so many on here. Perfect!
1,I purchased this firetv device so I can stream watch cable channels using PS VUE. The PS Vue interface on this device is very similar to the PS4 version. The only other app I use is Netflix and both apps works great so far.
1,Great value . Just as fast as any $100 tablet . Tons of free app via Amazon underground
1,"Not using this for much more than music right now, but it's been fun. I'm sure we will expand the use in the future."
1,"Perfect size for travel. Holds a lot of books, easy to download to."
1,Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it.
1,Best product out on the market. I no longer need cable .. must have
1,Since I already own one this is for my son and his family. They love it!
1,"Alexa is great to have around! Especially if you have Amazon Prime... literally the music will go ALL day until you ask her to stop! Best Buy had an incredible price on her. The echo does a variety of things besides play music. If you are into gadgets, this will not disappoint you!"
1,Great for kids if you don't want to spend money on the IPAD.
1,The amazon tables were great Christmas gift the kids love them
1,"Hulu, Netflix and more on this device. Ethernet cord from router straight to the firetv device is 10x better than connecting wireless"
1,Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
1,"I have a disability, an it is hard to do thing with alexa she help me"
1,Fantastic new Kindle. Very slim and light. Easy to carry and secure in baggage. Much clearer display and cool new features.
1,Nice tablet for the price. Has all the features I need and adding a micro SD card gives it plenty of storage.
1,This is a great device is you are to read a lot of text.
1,"If you are solely looking for the best reading experience, and not looking for tablet functionality, the Kindle Paperwhite will serve your purposes very well. Besides providing a great reading experience with its dictionary, Wikipedia acess and Xray function, the in book search function works perfectly. The Glow light also works great and has a very large range of brightnesses.The text is very crisp, and the battery life s excellent. An excellent buy."
1,"We bought the Fire TV box a few weeks ago to help save cost on cable tv. So far this has been a great alternative. We only have internet now and subscribe to Amazon Prime for around $100 a year. We subscribe to two other apps for $26 a month to get ESPN channels for basketball season and archived shows on CBS. The Fire TV box is easy to setup and use and there is also a Fire TV app that can be downloaded and used to control the box from a tablet or phone in addition to the Fire TV remote. There are thousands of tv shows and movies with the Amazon Prime subscription that are free.One nice feature is if we start a movie or show and don't finish one day we can go back the next day and resume where we left off. Another plus is the ""Alexa"" voice activated assistant to look up tv shows and movies and more just by asking. We have cut our cable cost by more than half. We did buy a digital antenna to get local tv in additon to the Fire TV box. So far we love our Fire TV."
1,Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there.
1,love my alexa. i have smart house items that works great with alexa and makes life a lil stress free
0,I wish this came in white to match my Kindle Paperwhite
1,Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
1,First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it.
1,"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model."
1,This is my third eReader in past 7 years . And Kindle paper white is my favorite . Enjoyable and clear reading no matter what the llight is even in bright beach sun or subdued night time reading . Touch screen page turning and menus are a delight . Access to Kindle store for book downloads and plenty of storage for many books are just some of the great features .
1,"Love this for my youngest. He had a Nabi, but it just wasn't as user friendly as this is."
1,great value. it doesn't hurt my eyes. So easy to use and upload books. best of all my kids wont try and use it to surf the web.
1,Great product!!!! Would totally recommend it to anyone!!!
1,"great price for a lot of fun. this is my 3rd amazon fire, great for games, movies. I installed kodi on it for extra programing and life tv. I loved my amazon fire TV."
1,Great 5 stars every home needs one. Just program it. Like it work for you
1,Great tablet for kids to play games and watch videos.
1,I bought 2 for my 4 and 5 year old and thet love it.
1,"Exactly what it is supposed to be. Works great and I love the built-in light. Perfect reader, and very quick delivery."
1,"Not only is it fun to use, but it has a good sound quality for playing background music. I use Alexa daily for anything from local weather forecast and news headlines to reminders for my daily schedule. I'm excited to add some WiFi lighting controls soon. It's cool, it's fun, and it's convenient."
1,I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me
1,"I love the Echo...tells me the weather, makes my shopping list, and plays music as I request. I didn't give it an excellent rating because products like this can always be improved on, but it's definitely a must have in your home and for the price, you can't beat it!"
1,"We enjoy using Alexa for scores of our favorite teams, weather, music and random questions that she is very quick to answer."
1,"The paperwhite is everything that I expected and more, it replaces my first Kindle."
1,"Not only does it play music, you can shop, create a shopping list, hear jokes, get the weather anywhere in the country and order food for delivery. Plus it keeps learning"
1,"It's a little different than most android devices but compatible with them. It was a very small (tiny) learning curve but if you are like me and using Amazon services like Kindle, Music, Audible or Prime then obviously the Amazon Kindle Fire was MADE with you in mind. Amazon Underground is great for kids as it's offering games that are otherwise paid or have in app purchases for the incredible price of absolutely free. It is amazing I don't know how they do that. I have a collection of games that would have cost me hundreds on my ipad. And there is the problem. You are going to have to buy one of these for you kids when they find out. Or you can install Amazon Underground on their own Android device."
1,"Much better than the echo dot, was able to buy this for$99 promotion"
1,Works great. No issues with it since I bought it a month ago. A good beginners tool for someone buying their first tablet. A great value at a reasonable price.
0,"Was surprised by reviews I read stating this device had a great display. By no means is the display bad, but please, this device only cost $40. It does not compete with the iPad and Galaxy tablets. The Fire OS needs some sharpening up."
1,Love my new kindle fire. The price was very reasonable.
1,I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
1,This is a great tablet - especially for the price. We bought 10 of them and gave them for Christmas gifts for family members
1,"It works well w/ existing prime members for videos. The device can be enabled to utilize amazon free for parents to control contents on the device (games, videos, books, etc). but there is a monthly charge to the service."
1,"This is probably the most used device in our home besides our phones. We use our fire tv daily, whether we are listening to music. Catching up on our favorite shows, or even watching a movie. I love the voice activated feature, it's nice to check the weather, movies playing at the local theatre, or look up you favorite artists."
1,We purchased this for our son (9) and it works great for him.
1,Have a few fire tv sticks but they lag a little bit. The box is worth the extra money.
1,Our 3 year old grandson loves asking Alexa to sing songs that he learns in pre-school.
1,"I have had a Kindle since they first came out. This is my 4th one and they just keep getting better. Reads great in daylight, night time, whenever."
0,"Bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. Battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why I gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. You always have an ad for something Amazon related, which can be annoying. But if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. I wouldn't recommend for adults."
1,This is much faster than the fire stick. Streams clear every time.
1,"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps"
1,"I purchased a Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet for my husband who has never used one. It was easy to set up .To help him get started, I moved the apps that he wanted to use to the top of the screen. In no time he was taking and storing his pictures and searching the internet.. The only thing we wish it would do better is turn on faster."
1,Best thing since sliced bread. I'd give 10 stars if I could.
1,"I think the Echo is a very useful product.Everyone should have one in there home.It is great as a alarm/as a weather man or as a weather woman, the programming is very simple.Echo is awesome on making shopping list and storing recipes.Echo is very entertaining with music and learning about your favorite artist all you have to do is simply ask it. it's awesome just awesome ."
1,This Kindle was purchased to replace a damaged kindle for my grandson. HE is familiar with the Kindle format so there was no learning curve. WE are both happy with the purchase.
1,Bought this Fire HD 7 for my son - he loves it!! I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.
1,"We got the FireTV because a friend recommended it to us. We were stick of our cable bill constantly going up and this was the best optio! It's a onetime purchase fee and you can download an App called Kodi and you can watch live Tv, previously played shows, and movie you can think of and even sports. Granted sometimes the quality isn't the best, it's free!! We were paying almost $200 for cable and Internet and now I pay $60 for internet and nothing to stay up with my shows and sports!! Best purchase I have made in a long time!!"
1,"My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!"
0,"It is a neat gadget; can do some things like track items for a shopping list and setting timers that are great. I would have expected it to be better at telling me things like when is TV show X on and what sound does a Cardinal (bird) make. All were met with ""I didn't understand the question."" Alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along, she does not. You also have to ask things in a way Alexa will understand. For example, you cannot say, ""Alexa, turn out the lights in the kitchen."" That ""does not compute."" But if you say, ""Alexa, shut off the lights."" She will do as you ask. I had to start writing down the ""correct"" way to ask her things so I would remember them. Again she needs to learn and adapt; not happening so far."
1,"Alexa has transformed out life at home. She chooses the music we listen to (""Alexa, play music""), she keeps track of our shopping (""Alexa, reorder cat food""), she makes sure we don't burn dinner (""Alexa, set a 15 minute timer"")...I find myself asking for things when I'm not at home, only to be disappointed she isn't there. We are looking forward to buying other ""smart home"" items so that she can help use even more!"
1,"This is a lot faster then the fire tv, I have both and love the fire tv because how much faster it is."
1,Christmas gift.
1,"It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks."
1,So far I like the backlit feature. I felt the price was affordable. The battery life is not as long as my previous Kindle but it does a lot more so that is to be expected.
0,The charger don't fit in the tablet I called Amazon
1,"The Amazon 7 Fire tablet is just what we needed, It works great with Amazon Prime and easy to down load books or movies. It's size makes it easy to handle for plane trips"
1,Alexa is the best choice in using your voice to change channels or request shows. The Amazon Fire also works with Amazon Echo and Echo Dot
1,"This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable."
0,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.
1,Easy to set up and lets me stream everything I want to
1,"If you read - novels, biographies, anything - you need this! Free download of thousands of books from your local library... or email pdf's to a special email address and read them here. imagine being able to take 100's of books to the beach for a few ounces, and read them in full sunlight. The high resolution screen is great, as is the feature that lets me automatically sync the last page I was reading on my kindle with the Kindle reader on my android cell phone. I really like the convenience of the free 3G cellular coverage..."
1,I got this as a gift. My mom is really enjoying it. It works great!
1,For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
1,Good deal on this product. We have several friends that have this and we love to play when we are at their houses
1,"The Amazon Fire is a great value for the cost. It is a nice size tablet to take on the go, watch movies and videos and check your social media sites and email. It's a great gift also. Even for those who have iPads and laptops. Very convenient and I highly recommend it for all ages."
1,This is a good product. I am giving it a 4 because sometimes it is slow.
1,"My 4 year old doesn't like the tablet for several reasons.. I can't say why, but she just doesn't like it. So, I'm going to have to get another tablet."
1,"Well worth the $50 for a nice tablet. It fits the bill. Nice display, no frills."
1,You can't go wrong with this purchase. It works great and easy for kids to use.
1,"I got this from my son as a Birthday gift. I am a low tech mom, so I'm still learning on how to use it. So far I listen to the news, musics, timers, telling jokes. Next on my list is cooking & more. If a low tech mom like me can use it, anyone can use it too."
0,I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.
1,This is exactly what I was wanting. It's perfect for what I want and it holds so many books!!
1,My 8 year old is required to read for 20 minutes a day for school. Something about reading on an electronic device excites and he is willing to read without a fight. Great purchase for us.
1,I moved from a tablet back to the Kindle Paper white because I can read it anytime anywhere. So happy for the non glare screen
1,I really enjoy using. Loads fast and responsive. Good screen
1,Got this for my son for Christmas as it fits perfectly in the pocket of his BDU's. This way he always has a book with him during down time.
1,Bought it as a gift for my mom and it's simple enough to get done what she needs
1,"The Echo is a nice and quick addition to finding weather forecasts & sport's scores. Also, we use-it daily for serving as our radio."
1,I think it's good for a first tablet. i m use to the Ipad so this is taking some getting use to.
1,"Good beginner tablet for kids. Could use a better resolution screen, but overall it is good."
1,Highly recommend. Easy to set up and Alexa is so much fun to use. Love her daily jokes and love to ask her to play any music. We bought a second one so that we don't have to keep moving her throughout the house.
1,Excellent Product.The Fire TV is the all around entertainment unit that continuously keep improving. I have it Paired with the Echo. Truly enjoyable.
1,Given me many hours of pleasure. Really enjoy the jigsaw puzzles.
1,I love my Echo. Working to fully automate my home and this is just the beginning. Love love love it
1,"Much easier on the eyes than a regular tablet and long battery life. You'd think it could be priced at the level of an inexpensive tablet seein how it's pretty much dedicated as a reader, but it is what it is and it's a good product for those who enjoy readin."
1,"Great product, love all the things you can do with the Echo - music, games, weather, sports, conversions, etc"
1,"Pretty good tablet. Very durable and my son loves it, keeps him busy lots of game to choose from educational as well"
0,5 dollar AC to USB power adapter for 20 buck
1,"Good size, Easy to set up and use for my grandkids"
1,Works well. Very bright and easy to read. Can watch Amazon prime with ease. Excellent choice for an additional way to access technology.
1,Great graphics and lots of apps and memory for the price.
1,I liked this product. A real good value. Was very happy with the customer sales person that helped me find what i was looking for and demonstrated how it worked and the benefits of one brand verses the other that i was considering.
1,"I love my new kindle. It was a birthday gift to myself. Best decision I could have made. A lot of bells and whistle. I love it because it was to navigate. Heck, I am doing this review on my kindle."
1,"I bought this for one of my friends who loves reading books. I have to say this product is wonderful because it looks like real paper. very comfortable reading experience. It is also very light, beyond my expectation. I recommend this."
1,I came in to Best Buy to get a game for my BF and ended up walking out with this for only $35! I always wanted one and am very happy with my purchase!
0,"The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great."
1,"We needed this Amazon Fire- TV in order to watch Amazon Prime on our new smart TV, which we also bought at Best Buy, It was easy to set up and works great, but it didn't come with a connecting cord and the salesman didn't say it needed one. Had to make a trip back next day."
1,"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
1,"A great cheap alternative to expensive tablets. It has everything that an expensive tablet has. I am giving 4 stars because the camera lens is not very good, but then again what do you expect for something under $40 bucks."
1,I bought it because it had great reviews yet was inexpensive. Worth every penny. The cases available r too pricey.
1,"I bought this as a requirement for my sons class. It was easy to set up, and he uses it with no problem at all. He just uses it for research in class, so I didn't want to spend a lot money-or give him my tablet, but I'm very pleased with all he's able to do on it. The price just seals the deal; I'm very pleased overall and would repurchase the tablet."
1,"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc."
1,"If you're willing to experiment, this could be really awesome"
1,This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.
1,This tablet is a perfect size and very sturdy. Has an expandable memory slot. Perfect for my needs.
1,"Bought this for a raffle gift, and everyone wanted to win it. I personally have one too, and love it."
1,Just purchased as a Christmas gift for my glambaby & she loves it !!!! Very nice case for little clumsy & at times rough hands!!!
1,"I have Amazon Prime and this makes it so easy to watch movies or tv shows. HULU, Netflix and many other ways to watch what you want when you want to watch it. I am now ready to cut the cable."
0,This tablet from Amazon is decent. The performance of the tablet is de end too.
1,I love my kindle Paperwhite in white. The battery lasts a long time without recharging. Your books are all in one compact location. you can add your own personal touch with color cases to protect your kindle. I take mine everywhere I go.
1,Great product for the price easy to use no problems.
1,Already had an Echo DOT so I knew what I was getting. Rich sound with this full size speaker. Alexa very pleasant as usual
1,Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
1,"This piece of tech. is amazing and functional. I liked it so much specially in the morning to check weather, news and listen to some music. High qulaity and solid."
1,"This is a great product, and I would recommend it to everyone. My kids love it more than my wife and I."
1,Good reader; basic tablet; needs access to google play apps
1,One of the best investments ever. Work great with all the streaming apps.
1,"Love the Echo, want to buy other products to make home more compatible with alexa."
1,It works great and meet my needs. Sling tv works great
1,Much better than my previous ereader; Highly satisfied.
1,Wanted a easy reading for outdoors. Close this based on reviews. Did not need to replace my iPad with the more expensive Fire tablet. Would have given it a 5 star but amazon packages them with out a charger adapter.
1,"My son is not gentle and has managed to destroy a few other, more expensive, tablets. I bought this for a fraction of what the other tablets cost and it works great. He loves it."
1,I love it and I'm I'm not using even a quarter of Alexa's capabilities. The thing that I love the most so far is the shopping list feature. If I take something out of the fridge that I need to restock I just ask Alexa to add it to my shopping list then its on my phone when I go to the store! no stopping in the middle of a recipe to find my phone to add the item. Also works great with Pandora radio. If a song that I don't know is playing and I want to know the name and artist I can either ask Alexa or look at the app on my phone. Looking forward to learning more about what she can do.
1,"I bought for my son, and he loves it. In his home they use it daily. Great gift for him and his family."
1,Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
1,"She is my companion. Talk to her about music, news and current events. She is lots of fun"
1,Way better than Apple TV. Very reliable user friendly
1,"I love the fire tvits great to stream netflix....amazon, it also lets u download games"
1,"GOOD PURCHASE HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, WOULD RECOMMENDS"
1,Very cool. My daughter loves throwing on dance music. Like that i can get news and weather by asking. Even had a pizza delivered
1,"""Santa"" got this for my 7 y.o. It works well on wi-fi, can link to our movie library via DMA app, add educational apps, and can expand memory via SD card. She can't put it down (much to our chagrin)."
1,Love the fire stick! I have been recommending it to all my friends.
1,Great tablet great price no complaints definitely great.
1,"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered."
1,I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and she loved it.
1,"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
1,"I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas."
1,"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget."
1,"Such a great product. Don't pay for cable anymore, that's a waste! I love this thing."
1,Decided to ditch cable and after my research decided to buy 2 of these. Installed PSVue on it for cable channels and don't have to pay equipment fees to the cable company anymore.
1,"I love the new Kindle fire 10"" HD. I love the large screen to watch movies on."
1,The echo is pretty fun to use but is definitely more useful when paired with other smart home devices. I can control my Lifx bulb and my Ecobee smart thermostat with voice commands. She's also programmed with some funny lines and is fun to chat with to see what she says.
1,"For the most part, this is a great little streamer. It has most of the apps that I need. Big exception is Xfinity support. I can't run any Xfinity apps from it, and I assume that I cannot run HBO GO because of that. Otherwise, It's fast and easy to use. Love the talking remote."
1,Much better than fire stick. Downloads much quicker
1,"The sole purpose of purchasing the Kindle Fire 7 tablet was reading. I own a Samsung tablet and when attempting to read I become distracted with social media and games. Right now, my Fire table only has apps utilized for reading and video and I've been able to stay focused. I love the portability of the Fire!"
1,"can't beat the price, decent size, makes a great gift this holiday season."
1,Great product. Perfect for adding some high tech to the home.
1,"I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren. They are young and do not need anything fancy. So, knowing these tablets are simple and easy to use for young children was the right one to purchase. They are very happy with the tablets and it is easy for them to understand and use. Excellent purchase."
1,The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy.
1,Great tablet and excellent for kids also. I have been recommending to everyone
0,After the initial trial questions found our Alexa's vocabulary is minimum and does not respond most of the time.
1,"Really neat little device! We were an Apple only ecosystem family but Alexa is fitting in just fine. We used it for listening to music and getting the weather mostly but have since discovered the skills that can be enable through the Alexa app. We already had a harmony hub and with a little setup after enabling the harmony skill we can now control our home entertainment devices with our voice such as ""Alexa, turn on Apple TV""."
1,Worked great ..... it entertained my 2 year old just great.
1,This product has great response to voice and the abilities are daily realized.
1,Love the easy use of the system and the lots of books you can get from amazon
1,i really enjoy this tablet made a great christmas gift
0,Best at its price. Just bought it because its less when compared ot other leading tablets. good for Skype.
0,I find Alexa to be extremely useless at times. It's a chore trying to search for specific music through Amazon's music list (this is trying to find common songs played on the radio currently)
0,"Something new for my wife. She is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tips. Its small and compact and easy t take on trips so she can read, take pictures or listen to her music."
1,The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.
1,Well worth the money. I found the Fire tv great and I really am satisfied I recommend it to all my friends and family
1,Love this tablet bought 4 for my kids and myself and play games and read on these!
1,Very easy to use and it is very convenient. Makes great gifts for anyone!
1,I got this tablet for my young nephew. I love the playtime feature so his parents can monitor how long he spends daily on the tablet.
1,It works well my granddaughter loves it she plays on it everyday
1,Excellent product! Smooth flowing lots of great free and paid apps!
1,"I love my Echos. I'm a 75 year old widow and I have 2 Echos and 3 Dots in various rooms. I can listen to audio books in the kitchen when I'm cooking and eating or in the laundry room. I play Jeopardy and listen to Country and Western music. At night when I'm trying to doze off, I tell Alexa to play music to help me relax and go to sleep. I tell her to wake me up at a certain time and then I ask what's on my calendar for that day."
1,"Great sound quality and very sleek to fit into any room décor. Due to the price reduction during the holidays, I ranked it a 5 versus a 4 if the regular price was applicable to my purchase. Satisfied enough to purchase two Amazon Dots for my family as Christmas stuffers...which they loved."
0,Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed
1,"I did some research on different streaming devices before I bought the FireTV. I would highly recommend it. I actually just cancelled my cable subscription because it works that well. I'm now saving over $100/month, you can't beat that. There are tons of apps and everyone can watch what they want."
0,This device plays on the fact that you must subscribe to their stuff or this is just a empty cylinder that tells you the weather and that's it. And even then there is a subscription required for everything. Google Home at least plays general music lists and a number of other key actions.
1,This is a very nice product for the money. It works great and is so easy to use.
0,works great once I figured it out. Books are easy to download.
1,So much faster then my Apple TV! I love it! Netflix loads instantly and very clear!
1,Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
1,"I bought this device to use to replace an Xbox One (for movies/streaming etc not gaming) - so far streaming movies, using the cloud to upload videos/photos work good. My only issue is getting the device to power back on - there is no ""power off"" you can put the device to ""sleep"" but I have had to unplugged it several times to get the unit back online - so far that is my only negative issue"
1,Over all my kids love their tablets. I would've given 5 but the fact that it doesn't have a lock to the app store I took off 1
1,"Got this as a gift for someone, easy to set up and they are enjoying it immensely."
1,This has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed.
1,This Paperwhite Kindle does exactly what it says....Great for reading Books outside in the sun light or when it is getting dark.
1,Great value. Easy to use. Fun to use. Easy to set up.
1,Better than the stick. Doesn't overheat and supports 4k
1,Love this newer version of an e reader. I had a Kindle Keyboard and loved it. I finally wore it out after 5+ years. This Kindle is even better as you can read at night.
1,This was purchased for my Kindle and I like it! Makes it easy to recharge it wherever I am. Recommend this product!
1,Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around
1,"Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email."
1,This tablet is the best for kids. Switching from kids to adult is awesome! Works perfect and has lots and lots of apps for kids
1,"Feels like you have your own concierge, butler, comedian and musician in the house. A lot of fun."
1,"I recently cut the cord to my cable and use the Fire TV as my streaming box for PlayStation Vue it works great easy set up, I just wish it had HDR"
1,The Amazon Echo like living 20 years in the future. We have not even touched the possibilities of this amazing machine.
0,"It's so hard to decide If i should recommend this device or not. It's super fast, gorgeous images processing when paired up with my Sony 4k. However, it doesn't have turn off button. You have to make it ""sleep"" to turn it off, or else they will keep turning on and keep draining your wifi resource. Too simplistic controller make it hard to type. No option to sign in and out of an app. You have to wipe the app clean or reinstall the app to sign into another account. These can be easily fixed with better software."
1,"I love the Kindle Fire, it is wonderful for playing games and watching movies"
1,"I use this device to collaborate all my entertained needs. Amazon Prime, Netflix, Plex, etc."
1,I like it is very good for all people and so simple for us
1,Amazon fire adds a new dimension to tv watching. So much easier to use than other remotes.
1,"It's a wonderful instrument with quick response time and good memory for downloading games, apps and videos. Great sound quality and great video quality."
1,My mom loves it. It gives her the very limited internet access she chooses and it's compact to go in her purse!
1,This is a good tool for reading without losing your bookmark!
1,"I love the amazon fire TV and other amazon products I have purchased. The gentleman who helped me at the store, was very gracious and patient in spending time explaining to me."
1,Power ups within minutes and great instructions on how too setup. Plus comes with internet security for several months.
1,I like it I use it for everyone. It's a great tablet
1,Wasn't too sure if I wanted to buy the echo or the dot but after using this product I'm very happy that I went with the echo. I find myself using it all the time.
1,Got this as a gift for s friend that loves to read books! Very convenient and portable. Doesn't heat up to bad either.
1,It is a great starter tablet for young kids. My son really enjoyed it.
1,Love the Echo. Alexa is my new favorite gadget. Can't wait to update the house
1,Lives up to all the positive comments that I found online. I have not encountered any of the negative issues mentioned in the reviews.
0,It is okay so to speak. It does what it says it will. I feel it has much more potential however and look forward to updates.
1,Perfect for a graduation gift when you are unsure of what the person finds interesting.
1,I bought this for my mother so she could have access to the Internet. Alexa is like a friend you can turn off...but why would you.
1,"Love this Amazon box, very great for putting Netflix and Hulu"
1,Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it.
0,It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it
1,Fire tv works great no issues long as your internet is working good you will forget you are streaming
1,Still the best streaming device for kodi Works flawless
1,"Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!"
1,How did I live without Alexa! Echo is phenomenal and the technology and response from Alexa is very impressive. A must buy for techies!
1,I purchased for my mom and she enjoys it she reads al day
1,"Works pretty good. Hey Alexa, whats this whats that. I love it."
1,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
1,"This is great for reading, it's light and easy to read. I love it."
1,Great item for the home we have used this item daily now
1,"Amazon has a great way of stream-lining their platform, operating system, and design style all within this 1 tablet; great product!"
1,"Great, lightweight, easy to carry and great picture for reading."
1,Awesome tablet for a cheaper price. Does what a regular kindle does.
1,Still learning with her. Speakers are outstanding and footprint on kitchen counter is small. Like it a lot.
1,The echo was set up easily and very fun to play. The speaker is good quality for playing music. The timer and shopping list are convenient features. Nice to have one.
1,Easy to read in the sunlight. I really like that it adjusts to the lighting available making it easy to read anywhere.
1,Use my echo everyday! Don't know how I managed without it.
1,I like the tablet. My 6 year old daughter is able to download lots of games and she loves it!!
1,Bought this for my niece in Jamaica and she loves it. This was the best $50 I spent all year.
1,If you want to cut the cable cord this the product needed!
1,Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!
1,I enjoy the echo. The speakers have great sound quality.
1,"I can read books, listen to books, go on facebook, shop, search the web almost anything on my brand new Kindle Fire!!"
1,For the price you can't beat it. Camera isn't the best as for zooming in but it takes good picture's. I also long the storage expansion
1,This tablet is light weight and thin which makes it ideal to hold on my hands. I love it!
1,"Echo should be in everyone's home! It provides so much entertainment. Music, Weather forecasts, shopping list and something to help organize your home."
1,"Easy to set up, ready to go! I start my morning asking about the weather and traffic. I bought this thinking I would eventually buy the smart bulbs, hub, etc. so I can have Alexa turn on/off the outside lights. So far, very pleased. Great sound quality for a smaller device, I was really impressed with the speakers."
1,Alexa is the future. If you get a harmony elite remote you can control your Tv by voice. You can also control your hue bulbs. What a great toy!
1,"I bought this as a guft for my family for Christmas and I think it has great potential for future next gen personal assistance. My Aunt absolutely loves it and it and she is a business owner and she uses it to keep up on stock quotes and knowing what her scheduled is for the rest of the day. my uncle uses it for sports updates and more... I know its new technology so I think it definitely worth the money but still can be a better AI in the future. I do wish that Alexa gave you time answer the questions back on certain skills like knock knock jokes, riddles and more...instead she tells you the whole joke without more interaction from the user. I will say i am still pleased from everside but ill be honest i think google home does have some abilities that alexa doesnt but I am still Amazon echo hands down and will be waiting for the next gen Amazon Echo to see where it goes. I also will purchase another one soon for myself."
1,"My husband is not much on high tech, but he loves this updated version of the Fire Tablet. He uses it mostly for Bible reading. He says it is easy to use and he can find passages much quicker than with his old kindle"
1,good tablet for the price. only drawback is the limited apps for the fire compared to android tablets
1,"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
1,I can use for so many different functions. It's easy to function
1,"It's a fantastic device.Really fast, super quite and I never have any issues with the remote staying paired like I did with my NVIDIA shield. So I highly recommend this device!"
1,"I have several of these, one for everyone in the family. Very inexpensive and everyone is happy."
1,"My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips."
1,This is my third kindle and by far the best! Easy to use.
1,I would love if it held the charge for longer. but it is great for the things that I use it for.
1,"Echo is amazing still learning more things,great product"
1,Does the job.Does the job.......................great
1,This is amazing tablet with almost all must have features
1,It's a awesome price for first time tablets for kids
1,"I bought the first kindle years ago for my sister. When my oldest turned 1, he wouldn't leave her kindle alone. We decided to buy him one & he has had it ever since. The learning apps such as the counting ones, ones about learning shapes, and learning his ABCs, assists in his advancement in his schooling. We all have a kindle in the house, to include my 3 year old (this is his first year with one). Love it!"
1,Decent sound as a music source. Rely on it for news briefing and weather reports.
1,This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -
1,Love the Echo. It is amazing. Does whatever I ask.
1,"As a book snob/purist - I put off buying a kindle for ages. After doing a lot of travelling and lugging around paperbacks, I decided it was time to grow up and get over it. While it may not have the satisfaction of turning a physical page, it makes up for it by weighing practically nothing, only having to have one hand free and being able to read it outdoors. Battery life is amazing - will last over a month with moderate use. Have been trying to convince all the other book lovers in my family to get one!."
1,"It's a little bigger than my original one I had for my kindle fire, and the prongs do not fold up. But other than that, works great!"
1,I purchased two for my kids for Christmas. They are not as easy to maneuver as an IPad but they loved them
1,I have been reading my Kindle books on my phone for a few years now but the light from the phone was causing eye strain and I could not read for very long. That is no longer a problem using the Kindle. I was concerned about the lighting on it but it works great. It is adjustable for low and high light settings and I can read as long as I like with no eye strain. I use it every day!
1,I install the echo in less than 15min and was using it and asking all kind of questions
1,"I purchased these to give to customer who hit a specific goal, and the competition was fierce - so fierce, in fact, that I decided to award TWO of them to the top two customers who both achieved the goal."
1,I bought this reader because my Nook was hard to read in the sun. THis reader was easy to use and great for any light including sunlight.
1,It's great I love it would recommend to anyone worth the money
1,"I am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in 3-4 years because that is the average life of kindle, this is my #4; they get slow, froze and die after 3-4 years. Moving from first gen paperwhite to the newest version, here are the noticeable changes:1. speed- this version is snappy, the new UI takes a little time to get used to.2. the LED lighting is even, no more ghost at the bottom of the page.3. cloud storage, book can be opened from the cloud and just start reading.Just like any other kindle, set up is easy, downloading over 100 titles of book to the device is fast. I do average 12-20 books a year, with the kindle of course, no worries on where to store them. Although the form factor of the oasis and voyage is very tempting but that additional price can buy lots of books!One complaint that I have is the USB cable is too short!"
1,Voice recognition has come a long way. Really amazed at how well it works.
1,It is great tablet for the price. The only downside it is a little slow at times.
1,"This is for our 2 year old. Yes, she is 2 and yes she knows how to use these. This tablet is perfect for simple use, children, reading, etc. I wouldn't want to boggle it down with hundreds of apps, but this does it's job and was a great deal at that price!"
1,Excellent voice recognition. Plenty of new skills to extend Alexa's intelligence.
1,It's amazing and I will like to tell a friend and family
1,I've had my Kindle Fire for a couple of weeks and am really enjoying it. I've been impressed with the processor speed and image quality. No problems playing videos or music. The E-reader app is great and has a lot of easy-to-use features. We paired this with Amazon Prime in order to utilize its functions more fully.
1,It was an online purchase. I have so far enjoyed my experience and my product.
1,Great value for the price. The kid loves it and compact so it travels well.
1,This tablet is very good for someone that has an Amazon Prime account. You can download movies and games from the Amazon app store.
1,"Including this purchase, I now have two Dots and three Echos. My home is more than halfway complete to being Smart. Just a few more Hue bulbs and hello modern day Jetson family"
1,"Works great, easy to use, picture is great too. Not missing my cable bill at all."
0,"Very disappointed that in order to get to my books, I have to get through ads. Didn't have this on my first Kindle Fire."
1,"Works great, allows the use of cat 6 and wireless use."
1,Works flawlessly once a strong wifi signal is established and love the ability to add Acorn TV (British productions)
1,I love the Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet. The screen view/ quality is great! I was worried about the durability at first being that I want to carry it around with me while traveling however I have not had any problems. I plan on using this tablet to supplement my laptop and will definitely recommend it to others.
1,This is amazing. And who can beat the price. Features and apps work well as well as touch sensitivity
1,Definitely my favorite e-reader that I have ever owned.
1,"Alexa is really great, I use her everyday requesting musics with my son. I also use integrating with my philips hue."
1,This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it
1,Being an Amazon Prime member this little box made a great addition.
1,"I bought this for my brother and he loves it. He uses it to watch videos, surf the web, and read books."
1,enjoy using Alexa every night! She's amazing! I'd recommend it to everyone!
1,I'm glad I purchased this item. I bought for my niece and she loves it
1,Great little tablet works very well for my daughters needs.
1,"Im still learning what the echo can do, but I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. I like interacting with the devise and letting me know what the temperature is outside."
1,It's great in performance compared to fire stick amazing product
1,fun product that will be used more and more the longer you own it.
1,I like my stuff... was greatly delivered .. nice job....
1,"Never had a streaming device, but so glad I got this. Helped me cut the cord and will not look back."
1,Best tablet I have had load up fast and camera is awesome
1,I purchased this for my son & daughter-in-law for Christmas. It had to be returned as it would not sync. They got another one and have not had any problems that I know of.
1,This is exactly what my wife was looking for. I would buy again.
1,Good reader to carry along for travels. I also bought a protective case from amazon which automatically shut down when closing the case. I only charged once during my 10 day travel.
1,This is a good tablet for kids and comes with a good warranty
1,Great for family time. HD is awesome. Great product
1,The Fire TV works great. Bought it mainly for my kids to watch their shows in their room without adding another cable box and wiring to my home. I am an Amazon Prime Member and the free content available is sufficient for all the kids regardless of age. We're talking 6 to 20 years old! The remote was a little temperamental at first but has been working fine after a regular software update.
1,"Truly power fast.Amazon products are great! Love how the charger is made well, sturdy, and does exactly what it says it will do!"
1,Would definitely recommend to family and friends that have little kids great learning tablet
1,"With the new update allowing hands-free ""Hey Alexa"" commands, this is a great device. The battery allows you to disconnect from the wall. The sound is very good and fills a small room well with decent levels. Alexa is very accurate (most of the time) to voice commands. My only complaint is that Bluetooth streaming from devices (like my iPhone or iPad) sometimes breaks up and stutters a bit. Other than that, I think this is a great device."
0,"It's ok, it's good for beginner users, the kids love it because they could play games on it"
1,The Amazon Firebox process a lot faster then the fire stick. Both product is good. I connect the box to my router and it zip to Netflix in a zap.
1,Is great to have hand free speeker and sound very good ... i love my new amazon speeker
1,"From the moment I set it up, I loved it! Helps me relax with whatever type of music I need at that particular moment. So much information at my fingertips, or rather "" my voice""! Easy ,quick setup, what is there not to like!"
1,This tablet is great and easy to use. Very convenient and handy to have around
1,Got this for my granddaughter she loves it was a hit at Christmas good first tablet
1,Alexa is quick and intelligent. She can hear you from way farther than I expected. Music and audio sound great as well.
1,It does exactly what it says for the right price..
1,"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc."
1,This is an awesome product. My kids love it. They listen to everyday
1,It's a great tab for low end applications. Especially for kids.
1,I enjoy this reader due to its large storage capacity for my growing library and the ability to navigate to a given location in no time flat. The bright but adjustable lighting is very welcome as well.
1,"The echo is great for someone who doesn't have time to stop every time you need information. Are in the mood for a certain type of music, etc."
1,Was over a friends house and they had one so I decided to get one. This is awesome.
1,Good and smooth speed. Long battery with quick charge
1,"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
1,"Seems less finnicky than the Chromecast (sorry, the *GoogleCast*) in a lot of ways... though I learned how picky it is about resolution when I tried hooking it up to a stand-alone monitor. It didn't care for that so much."
1,Great product. Being able to connect to the modem directly is great. Solves some of the streaming issues normally associated with using wifi.
1,I can pretty much use voice activation on many things in my house some twiking is needed but I like it ...
1,Brought it for a Christmas present for someone who reads a lot. Easy to use and user friendly
1,Happy with my purchase. This product keeps my nephew occupied for hours.
0,Price is nice but performance was not. Sluggish to the point of frustration even to my 4 year old. Would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device.
1,Great device. Everyone should get one. Great for the entire family with hours of fun.
0,"So I was excited to get this when Best Buy started caring them. The thrill for was short lived. First week was fun to use it for music, weather, cooking, and jokes. But after that I lost interest. Attaching to my Hue lights and Nest were a longer process to make it work. I'd rather pull my phone out. Plus with a 2 story house it is useless if not on the same floor. Maybe I'll buy it again or a 2nd version when its released"
1,Love having someone to take notes for me and play music on demand.
1,The Echo by Amazon has exceeded even my own high expectations (which is quite an acheivement)!
1,Bought a gift for my mom. She absolutely loved it! Great purchase. Great price! No complaints.
1,Great for my younger kids. My son is autistic. WTG
1,This product was perfect for all my needs. It is very very easy to use. I would definitely recommend it
1,"This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio. Small speaker fills the Garage like a concert hall. Battery last 8 hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use."
1,I purchased this for my wife to replace her old Fire. She loves the additional new features (camera/video) and the extra memory seems to speed things up for her. Happy wife = happy life....
1,Amazon Fire TV is a great system you able to watch videos on Netflix. Play video games also be able to do a lot of streaming very excellent system I will recommend this for other people to buy if they're wanting to gain more an lot of streaming.
1,Hard to set up an email. Also it's difficult to navigate with until you use it for quite a while
1,This tablet replaces a tablet I've had for several years and I am very pleased with its flexibility and size. I'll expand it with apps as yet unknown. I expect it to fit in with my home network.
1,"Got for my 4 year old. The parental controls are nice. I wish the netflix app was registered as ""video"", so I could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. I'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. He plays Star Wars Angry Birds and Star Wars Commander and loves them. It's a good size for little hands. It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching."
1,I love how fast it goes from one program to another program I like the apps that it has on it and also I like that is able to work with all my televisions that will problem.
1,Super fun and enjoyable. Bought them as Christmas presents
1,I love how clear the screen is and the tablet is easy to use. I love that I can make a profile for each of my kids and put limits on what they do and how long they get to play.
1,Good tablet for basic use. It is great for traveling.
1,Awesome only ga e four stars because in order to allow a child to use it you have to set a password/pin. And ecah time that child goes to use it they would need to enter it. Which would have been too much for the 5 yr old that I bought it for as a Christmas gift.
1,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
1,"Much easier to read without a heavy book, especially in bed."
0,"This tablet is easy to use but if you need to use play store, so I don't recommended because it doesn't have"
1,so much fun to use. Also streamlines ordering and other task. Great for listening to music as you think of it.
1,I brought this tablet based on word of mouth. After buying this item I see that it is easy to use.
1,We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading.
1,"Like the product, takes a little time to restore previous data"
1,"I love using to check my e-mails, go facebook, trying to figure how to use the camera. Once I do I'll start using it."
1,Sound is great and very easy to use. Like the app that shows what song is playing and what songs have played. Like the ordering feature to use for reordering past purchases.
0,basic tablet. Good for beginners. Easy to carry. It can be used with ease.
1,It's a positive addition to the household. I enjoy having Alexa.
0,"You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab."
1,"I recommend everyone get this special product. The fire tv is so easy to use my five year old daughter knows how to use it. Everything is straight forward and is easy as one two three in setting up. I have tried other media players and this one take top billing. What are you waiting for, go get a fire tv if you haven't already."
1,"I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all."
1,"My only gripe is the lack of certain apps on the Kindle store, but it's only a handful. Lightweight good resolution - good for those not willing to drop $100s on iPads."
1,"Bought for my 3 children ages 3,4,and 5. They all seem to love them. My only problem is the battery life is low so they are always complaining that they are shutting off.For a parent that is not to big a problem unless you work from home and are trying to keep them quite."
1,Very simple design which makes it very easy for me to navigate through any screen.
1,I bought this item for my preteen granddaughter. She enjoys reading and learning apps. This device travels well and is easy to use.
1,Gave to my great nephew. 2.5 yrs old. He loves it and his father no longer has to turn over his phone to his son.
1,This was purchased for my 14 year old grand daughter and she loves it. The Kindle Fire does everything she needs it to do. We are very pleased.
1,Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
1,Love be my fire stick so much I bought 3 more for the house. I would recommend the fire tv but for less then $40 it's a steal!
1,"Perfect tablet for the budget-minded. Obviously not as powerful or flashy as many other models, but at this price point, you can't go wrong."
1,"Easy set up, great for music streaming. This is my 2nd Echo, got last one thanksgiving sale, so happy I did."
0,"I had to replace my Kindle 3G keyboard after several years because it would no longer charge. So I got this one and I'm satisfied, but I really miss my 3G. The only feature that's better in the newer Kindle is the light. Turning pages is my main complaint with the touch screen. It sometimes doesn't register the touch and you have to do it again. Also going back a page is a pain. Supposedly the left 25% of the screen is for going back, but it seems like the left 10% at best and just to be safe I press on the very edge. I miss the buttons for turning pages.I also miss the 3G even though I didn't use it all that often. Now I just need to make sure I plan ahead on road trips."
1,Got for my 9 year old grandson. Durable & plenty fast for his games. No more squenting to see his phòne
1,"Love this item, it is absolutely amazing for you home."
1,User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.
1,I love my new Kindle! Very easy to use and a great price!!! I take it everywhere!
1,"The is the best product of its kind, period. I would recommend it anytime."
1,This is a great tablet for downloading books & movies. It also takes pictures as well as surfing the web. All in all very satisfied with purchase
1,"My 88-year-old sister-in-law spends many hours each day alone. She has macular degeneration and is not able to read or use a computer. The Amazon Echo has been a ""friend and companion"" by making it possible for her to get answers quickly to all the questions on her mind and to select music that she wants to hear."
1,"This is my third Kindle and the best one yet. Love the new controls, the backlit page, the compact size and the ease of use. I would recommend the Kindle Voyage to all readers!"
1,Bought this tablet for my mom who has never owned one before. Honestly for only 50 bucks this thing is pretty good. It can have a bit of lag from time to time but otherwise very nice. My wife had a first gen kindle fire when they came out. It cool to see how much this Amazon has matured their OS.
1,I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
1,Holds charge well. Portable. Lightweight and as best we can tell nearly indestructible. Perfect for kids
1,I'm really happy with my Kindle Fire! It's easy to use and has so many features…don't know why I waited so long to get one :)
1,I used a friend's older Kindle and liked it. Wish this one had the side buttons for changing pages. Got this version because it has the light. I read at night when I can't sleep and the light is bright enough so that I don't have to turn on the bright overhead light.Battery life is nice. Was a pleasure taking it on a trip cross country with out having the weight of the books to shelp.
1,"It's a nice toy, grandkids had hours of fun trying to get funny answers out of Alexa. I had to change the name to echo, told the grandkids I turned off, peace finally."
1,Simply the best the fire stick is also a great deal but for flawless connectivity fire tv is worth the extra green backs.
1,"Not indispensable, but handy. Set alarms, timers, make shopping lists. Could easily expand applications with extra hardware"
1,"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
0,"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
1,Bought the Fire Tv over the Fire stick due to the fact that it has more memory. Great for streaming. Only problem is that it freezes sometimes and you have to hard reset it.
1,The best e-reader. It's light weight and holds its charge for days. Awesome!
1,My 8 yr old twin had a tablet previously and we have no idea where it's at. So this time around I didn't want to spend much but wanted her to be able to go to all her fav websites. So far I love it!
1,Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
1,Was looking for cable tv alternative. This just might be it.
1,This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
1,I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
1,Easy to use at home or lunch at the office. The only problem I have is that you have to restart often. Great while using public transportation.
1,"Got it for daughter Christmas they love it, I haven't figured out how to run it yet."
1,If you have a smart tv you might not want this unless you are going to install kodi
1,"I purchased 3 of these, one for each of my children."
1,I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
1,Really love everything this product can do. So easy to carry from one room to another.
1,"Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it."
1,This might be the best product that I have ever purchased.
0,There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.
1,"Much better than the fire stick, faster and less buffering."
1,Best buy ever for my 3 year old. Only purchased because they were out of the Galaxy tablet. I'm glad. This tablet is PERFECT for my 3 year old. I love that it has 2 modes. The kids mode sometimes freeze and takes a minutes for apps to open. Also didn't download Netflix movies like indicated. But regular mode works great. My daughter loves watching weird homemade youtube movies anyway.
1,"This product has exceeded my expectations, great quality and design. The prize is unbelievable for a tablet of its kind."
1,Great picture and worth the money. Great for even older TV's.
1,"The Kindle PaperWhite is a great device. It's easy to use and the size is very convenient. When I take it on a trip, it's like having a whole library with me. Compared with the Kindle App on my cell phone, I find the KindlePaper White a lot easier to use and the size is better. It's easier to read and it feels like a book."
1,When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn't know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need.
1,"The Kindle Paperwhite is awesome. It is much easier on your eyes than an iPad or even the Kindle Fire. I read more because it doesn't cause eye strain and I'm not distracted to look at emails or the internet. If you like to read magazines, books and newspapers this is the device to have. There is no better e-reader."
1,Arrived yesterday as promised! Little one loves it
1,The kindle paper white is amazing. I love that there is. No glare for outdoor use and the backlit is perfect for reading in bed.
0,"Not the best tablet. Decent image, but lackluster performance."
1,"So far the Amazon Fire is great, with limited issues. We are used to clicking on our DVR and watching all the taped programs we missed. We are still trying to figure out how to do that on the Fire."
1,"This would be a perfect gift for anyone. Easy to use, and we'll put together device."
1,Way better than the firesticks. I would definitely recommend this item
1,"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value."
1,I am not really a fan of tablets but when this one came out it had my attention... I bought it as a gift to surprise my husband with and he absolutely loves it..... love the fact that you can set the background and it's not as hard to operate like the older kindles...
1,"I GOT THIS TABLET FOR MY DAD, HE'S NOT REALLY INTO TECH ITEMS BUT THIS TABLET LOOKED EASY TO NAVIGATE AND IT SEEMED GREAT FOR THE PRICE TOO AFTER READING THE REVIEWS I WENT AHEAD AND PURCHASED IT. MY DAD HAS BEEN USING THIS ITEM EVERYDAY SINCE HE GOT IT. I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT! ITS GREAT FOR THE PRICE AND WORKS WELL. MY MOM ALSO PURCHASED TWO OF THE SAME TABLETS FOR MY NEPHEWS."
0,"Definitely not as smooth as hoped, then again for the price. But internet browser was really bad and you can't add chrome out the box"
1,Us good for My family I recommend yo My Friends good programs good signal
1,Excellent product thanks !Thanks for the help choosing what I was looking for and all the variety of apps that are available on this one.
1,Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.
1,"Easy to use, works great with Amazon music. Connects with Pandora and iheart radio."
1,Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.
1,"Easy to install, easy to use. Even the kids can handle it."
1,Awesome! Perfect for all readers. The backlight is great for reading in bed.
1,These things are awesome. I buy them all the time for my employees as bonuses or gifts. They are reliable and durable. Don't over heat and hold up nicely. Great product.
1,Enjoyed a lot. Great tablet for the price: well worth the money spent! A bargain!
1,Bought this black Friday for 34 bucks. Cheap but reliable and nice. I would recommend this to everybody. It's fast and nice looking
1,This system is very informative and fun! My daughter's and grand daughter enjoy. Requesting music selections to listen to.
0,"This table works okay but slow. Warning, this device is ad subsidized for the price, meaning you have to see ads."
1,It is awesome with low price and high quality. My daughters like it very much.
1,"Bought it on sale for $10 less than buying it from Amazon, My only complaint would be that I should have grabbed 2 instead of just one!"
1,Gone are the days of spending 600 on an iPad! Thank you Amazon!
1,"Not as good as the higher end Kindles, but nice product for the price point. If you're an avid reader, and especially if you are an Amazon Prime member then this product offers an incredibly great price for entry into the Kindle reading products, especially now that there is Amazon Prime reading. For even more value and selection, join Kindle Unlimited. In short: This little device and a Prime account offer an incredible selection for countless hours of reading. I can't see how you can go wrong, unless you plan to watch videos and then I recommend one of the nicer Kindles...maybe? This one can do the job, it's just an entry level, basic model; but for reading, I don't believe you'll ever wish for more."
1,"The text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. When using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights. Can set on automatic brightness level or manually set. Slim and lightweight when not using a case which I appreciate most about this kindle. Makes for easy holding and carrying/packing. Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up. We can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like. This is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go. I would give it 4.5 if that was an option."
1,"I picked up two of these for the twins and they love em' I have to take them away from them sometimes, schoolwork has to come first ! Great tablet gave it 5 STARS, and at 50 bucks you cant beat it !"
1,Works well for beginner or a child. Great gaming tablet
1,"PERFECT SIZE FOR TRAVELING, COMPACT AND LIGHT, AMAZON APPS ARE INCLUDED, GREAT FOR STREAMING VIDEOS AND SHOWS ON THE GO!!!!"
0,"Easy to use, load books and to read in out door light conditions. Very light to hold and read."
1,"This Tablet is amazing in low budget which has all good stuffs like dual camera, memory and free Amazon underground application"
1,This tablet is very easy to use and a perfect size.
1,My son just loves watching movies on it. Very easy to use.
1,I purchased fire tv because you can download apps onto it so I can use Directv Now. Easy setup and has worked great.
1,Good price within batter quality love it works perfectly
1,"Great product, easy to use and able to get many shows and movies"
1,Just plug it in and off you go....easiest electronic setup there is.... di turn out I didn't need it as the Samsung TV I bought has the Amazon Prime app on it.
1,Love the new Kindle. Priced right. Perfect size. Take it with me everywhere.
1,"Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price."
1,Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Great value for the money
1,Would definitely recommend! Works well with iPhone
1,Very good value and easy to use. Wife loves it much better than using phone for her apps.
1,"I had read that the tablet supported gps, for Pokémon go. You can make Pokémon go work, but this tablet does not have built in gps, it uses wifi triangulation. It is great for watching movies, YouTube, and social media apps. It's also great for reading books."
1,"I've tried the Google Home and the simple ""Ok Google"" is a syllable too long for ease voice control use. The echo simply has so many compatible devices even separate from my Smartthings hub that it can control. The soubd it delivers is sufficient for standalone use but option to connect to speakers via Bluetooth or AUX is useful. It can hear you much better than the Google Home and the integration with other echo dots in a smart home makes the experience seamless. Setup is a breeze. My only gripe is that commands need to be exact to your setups so you just can't say ""turn off all lights"" without a trigger made up unlike Google home. Overall, it's a great product for home automation and voice control."
1,I seriously use this every day... Do some research on what is really available to do with this device and you will not regret spending the 100$ plan on buying one for everyone I know at the holidays this year.
1,The kids love there new tablet and it got here so fast that I was shocked I only like shopping at Best Buys
1,This is such a great gift for the whole family!! I would recommend
1,"Will recommend to friends and family, best tablet I bought"
1,Amazon Echo is simple to use and very easy to set up.
1,Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!
1,Great tablet for beginners at a great price point. Takes a little to get used to the Amazon operating system. Make sure you get a memory card with this as you have limited internal memory
1,It is a good tablet for the price and for young children.
1,Quite an amazing piece of technology. Within the months we have had this item it has continued to better itself with knowledge and understanding of different questions. Very convenient for listening to music. The sound quality is better than any Bluetooth speaker I have ever owned. Highly recommend it!
1,Wonderful item. Works well with current set-up. Highly recommend.
1,it works. does what its supposed to. looks good beside my black tv. and really good on my white mantle.
0,Mostly good for shopping lists and listening to music getting game scores etc. Hopefully will have real search functions in the future. Easy setup. Phone app
1,"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news."
1,Bought this for my 89 year old mother. She loves it!
1,I have an older Kindle. I usually read without back lighting but I like having the option to use it in a darkened room.
1,Overall the product is great for listening to music
1,"We love the Amazon Echo, free music, product reviews, weather."
1,"This was a replacement for a poorly functioning new purchase of a Kindle 7. Seems to be working fine, but some games loading from Amazon have issues."
1,Needed a replacement tablet and looked at a variety of options. The Fire was at a good price and is working well.
1,Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child
1,More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
1,I have tried all of the Fire TV and I have to say this one is the best especially if you have a 4K TV. I bought this to go with my 4K TV and I have to say it doe snot disappoint. There is a lot of 4K HDR content out there and this is a good place to get a lot of it. I highly recommend getting this version if you are on the lookout for the best.
1,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
1,"This is a good device. I initially bought the google home. I was very dissatisfied with it. I returned it and bought Amazon Echo. I am happy with it. I have had some difficulty a few times getting it to recognize my voice, but it is a very good unit. I am still learning what all it can do."
1,"Great deal on this tablet, easy for my son to use."
1,This is a great device being utilized by my 5 year old for interactive learning activities. Don't have anything wrong to say about this. This is a great buy.
1,I would highly recommend this reader for anyone. Easy to download books and fast! Love the fonts and sizes. Lightweight. Great for travelers.
1,I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
1,This device is amazingly! I got one as a gift and knew I had to gift one back!! So glad I no longer have to shuffle through my music! I can just ask Alexa and the song is played!! Great product!! 10**********
1,Great way to get info quickly and it's so easy to use
1,"My husband and I originally bought this for our 1 year old so she could be busy on our longer road trips however when it wasn't being used by her, we would listen to our audio books from audible and it was relaxing and provided good bonding moment . Unfortunately, I left it in the trunk of our rental car and when I called the dealership, they said they didn't find it.. we only had it for about a month!"
1,The Amazon - Fire TV worked great our needs. It has all the features we liked.
1,"The Amazon Echo has been an amazing and also somewhat frustrating experience. The convenience it brings with timers, turning on connected lights, playing music, and just corny jokes is amazing. I love this machine but it also does become a little frustrating when it doesn't work immediately. In the time I've had it, it has mostly worked on the first try but there are definitely days when the lights won't all turn on when asked. Sometimes it takes a long time for Alexa to respond to the commands (Could be an internet issue, but still detracts from the experience). All in all, it is an awesome device and I have enjoyed it immensely."
1,"This is an outstanding tablet, especially for the money. Does all I need it to do at a great price."
1,Love this size. It fits in my purse perfect. Love all the features it offers. The price was the best part.
1,"Bought this for my brother who is a Dino when it comes to technology, it's easy to use and a great size ,he loved it!"
0,"How do you rate a charger--something you need, but don't really want It works, so it is okay."
1,I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one
1,I have enjoyed my kindle since purchasing it over 5 months ago. As a law student it's a great way to have all of my books on one device and accessible on the go.
1,I decided to cut back on bills so bought this to stream movies an TV shows. Works great so far as long as my Internet is good.
1,Great product fun and interesting would recommend to everyone
1,They really enjoy it and I will buy it again for another gift
1,"It took a little while to figure it out, but once I did it is very simple and easy to use! Convenient and great for reading both indoors and outdoors which is exactly what I was looking for."
1,"It does what I need it to do, slight flicker when going through things, but it's a good piece to have."
1,"Good bang for your buck, as far as a tablet goes, works well camping"
1,"Great buy, great update. My new go to tablet, could ask for more."
1,A great addition to this product is to add Kodi for all your movie and television show needs
1,"I've bought Fire TV originally for my second TV which is not a smart tv. Shows start playback instantly, voice search is the easiest thing to use. My only complaint is that voice search does not work in 3rd party apps yet."
1,"The speaker quality exceeded my expectations. I have used some of the Skills and am very please with them. Being a Prime member I think the best feature is the access to Prime music, though Spotify Premium members probably could enjoy the same selection if not better."
1,I didn't know how much I would love this ...but I use it everyday.
1,Great quality picture and sound for the price! Easy to navigate through menu's and app's.
1,I like this item you can watch a number of shows and movies streaming 4k
1,So many features than even my 5 yr old has no prob using it . Love it
1,"Love my kindle it's the best size for the price. Wonderful applications to download for reading, play movies and music. A plus rating"
1,The echo is great. It can run smart home products and play music.
1,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
1,"Love the size and screen. Wish there was a chrome app for Kindle, but great for casual surfing. Great for ebooks."
1,"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
1,Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
1,Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
1,If you plan to watch live TV. Get this one.If not fire stick is good.Also get this if you plan to install other apps as it has upgradeable memory
1,"Never realized how useful the Echo is until you start using it. Setting alarms, timers, weather, traffic, music, you name it!"
1,"This tablet was purchased for an older relative who just ""had to have a tablet"". Amazon has a lot of free stuff to download!!!--Set up was a breeze--Great Tablet and greater price."
1,"My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera"
1,Great product great price great service. Can't asked for anything better.
1,I love this product! It was easy to set up and fun to use!
1,"The echo works well. It was easy to setup, functions as advertised. Very good response and reacts well to our voices.Good device."
1,"The price is really attractive, and kindle is good to use."
1,Had the Roku before this and had a big problem with it buffering all the time. This one works much better.
1,I love the fact that I can have it play all types of music. The Alexa also helps with amazon shopping and current events.
1,"I love my kindle fire it is very convenient and handy, perfect size"
1,I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
1,"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it."
1,Love the built in light and the screen makes it easy to read outside
1,Easy setup..and for the price you get a solid company
1,Can answer questions about anything found on the internet. Also plays music you request. Disappointed that it can't dial numbers via my cell phone though. A little expensive for what it does I think.
1,"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far."
1,This Amazon Fire tablet is an excellent barebones tablet that is great for checking email and surfing ineternet keeping tabs on facebook and twitter! At 50 bucks ya can't go wrong!
1,Cool tablet kids love it affordable nice gb size awesome
1,Love it nice parental controls but be careful screen will crack.
1,I had an Apple TV but replaced it with this Fire tv on my main tv because it offered the same features but added 4K which a comparable Apple tv did not. It works flawlessly and I couldn't be happier.
1,This small little tablet is perfect for reading emails and playing computer games. It's light weight makes it easy to hold for even long periods of time. It's low price makes it affordable as a supplement to other tech items. I keep mine by my favorite chair.
1,Great for moderate use. It is awesome for movies and light reading.
1,I love this little tablet! I can do all my school work on it. Great value.
0,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.
1,"I like everything about the Voyage reader. It has a crisp display, is small and lightweight. I give it four stars instead of five because the screen light takes sometimes a while to adjust. The battery life is amazing. Prize could be a little less."
1,"It's 35-50 bucks, there is no better tablet for that price range, toss in prime and it's even better!"
1,Purchased for a xmas present and it has lived up to the hype.
1,Incredible range. Clear sound. We bought the sleeve and hung it in the backyard for a party. Amazing 360 clear sound.
0,Not very user friendly. A bit slow & heavy. Burned out pixel right out of box. Noticeable but not bothersome. Still like my iPad after trying fire.
1,This has become a great option for me to read anywhere. The best part is I have the Kindle app on my phone and it keeps track on the pages between the two devices. I'm very happy with this purchase!
0,Good tablet for kids 10+ . My wife uses it to read on long drives
1,Great for Entertainment and easy to use.Just give Echo a command and it will respond.
1,"Does everything I asked of my Kindle - I read and play games - but also does so much more if you need to, including taking photos. A very cost-effective little tablet."
1,"You won't find a better tablet for the price. Tried multiple different tablets in the same price range and the amazon fire outperformes them all in every category. If you want a good tablet and on a budget, this is your tablet!"
1,Affordable price awesome quality I love my Amazon fire tablet
1,"Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7"" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift."
0,"The device itself is good designed.I'm Amazon prime member, but found that the amazon prime video/tv isn't that good. Can't find many good video to watch."
1,Great eReader. The PagePress feature is so much better than swiping to turn pages. My only complaint is that I had to turn the auto adjust light feature off as it doesn't seem to reasonably adjust based on where I am reading.
1,This box is works great all the apps work and are responsive with little to no lag. For 99 bucks it's a great deal I barely watch cable anymore because you can access tv shows on every network from the most recent to the first episode. I use this every single night since buying it and have had no problems with it at all
1,The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case
1,Have had some fun with it but it really is not very smart and sometimes just plain wrong. Did you know that all of Florida is in the Eastern Time Zone? And here I thought I lived it the Central Time Zone. Alexa does get the time right though and can share some good information and does ok with music. You just need to ask the right questions in the form she understands and then she does ok.
1,I bought four of these tablets for my grandkids for Christmas. I already have three Kindles myself I am very pleased with. It's so easy to use the tablet instead of my desktop computer. Great sound and graphics!
1,This is the fourth Kindle I bought as a gift. Perfect for any occasion.
1,The only knock I have with this product is that it does not support vudu movie app. So...I have to connect to it through other means
1,We love  it!! I just need some help and tips on how to work it!!
1,Love to have access to books anywhere I want or need
0,"I came across this on sale and couldn't pass it up. Turns out it runs slower than I expected though. My girlfriend has an older version of this model and it just seems to run smoother than this one. Still, a nice alternative for browsing/shopping/bill paying than wearing about my smartphone battery."
1,My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!
1,I love this product really great out the box easy to use
1,Heard about this from a friend. Best Buy answered all my questions. Enjoy the product
1,Very very good table nice definition and quality I like
1,"I just bought a 4K tv so I wanted to make certain that I obtained a media player that delivered 4K content. I looked that the Roku, Apple TV, but I settled on the Amazon Fire TV because of my previous Amazon account and the price point. The device is quite elegant with a small form factor. The remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective. The mic works great to interact with Alexa. Just for fun, I found it interesting that Alexa will answer a question comparing it to Siri, but Siri does not reciprocate.I like that Amazon has deals to allow HBO GO streaming on it, whereas my Sony TV was not allowed to thanks to some deal between Comcast Xfinity and the networks. Other apps such as Youtube and Sling also work just fine on the app. It also syncs up to your Amazon account and on some songs, lyrics will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service. I thought that was a nice feature.I wish there were a few more options on it to customize loadout or app management. Also, at times the device would disconnect from my N network and connect to the G band for some reason, forcing me to manually reset it. I wish it would automatically connect to the higher band, but it's a minor complaint. The bottom of the remote can scratch easily as well, so don't slide it across the coffee table as I am apt to do.Overall, this is a great product and I have no regrets purchasing it."
1,Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price
1,By far the greatest tablet for kids. Free time is fantastic. I don't have to worry about content for my child. And the two year worry free warranty is in heard of. 2 thumbs up
1,"I only use this for simple stuff, and so far I have no complaints. I bought it for thirty something bucks and all I can say is what a deal."
1,I got it for my son he loves it very good for travel
1,"It's basically adding ""smart tv"" to my ""dumb"" tv! A lot of free movies to choose from, some rentals seem rather high, but no biggy because there a lot of options out there for that. Love the lyrics that play with the music!!"
1,"Great sound. Great for playing music, or controlling your home. With some exceptions. Don't expect Alexa to answer any questions you have though. ""sorry, I don't know the answer"" is a common response. Obviously google home is going to have great access to google but can't Alexa at least TRY?"
1,This e-reader is amazing. It is so light and easy to read with one hand. The screen is great and the battery lasts for weeks.
1,This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.
1,Great picturesPower and fast speedEasy to use!!!!
1,I'm love my fire tv great app to download for movie and tv
1,"Bought this for my mother, it is inexpensive and easy to use it's a lot of fun too."
1,Easier on the eyes than my Ipad. Purchasing at Best Buy was convenient with online order/pickup and they matched the Amazon price!
1,This tablet is perfect for a young child. The case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.
0,No access to the Internet.........Won't recommend!
1,"I was a little nervous at first to buy the Fire TV. I researched the main streaming services: Roku, AppleTV, and Amazon's stick and FireTV. Price wise for what I get-FireTV has pleased me. I can do anything (and a little more) with the FireTV. The picture is very clear and I even love the screen savers that pop up when I have left the room for a while. I am appreciating how I can connect my TV to my Amazon Echo. I CAN DO EVERYTHING HANDS FREE NOW. For the price and quality, it doesn't get much better than this."
1,My family loves the Echo and I also have one in the office.
1,Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.
1,I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!
1,"Top notch streaming box, especially if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. I like the voice search but wish it extended to other applications like Netflix."
1,Great product.. lots of fun for the family.I would highly recommend
1,"Simple, easy to set up and an all around great product"
1,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. I would reccommend .
1,"Small tablet, I have an Ipad but this item is great to take along fits in your purse and is very durable. I have purchased 3 other for family."
1,Great starter tablet for media consumption and games.
1,Exactly what you expect from this product. Great for it's price.
1,My daughter loves this tablet hard to get her to put it down. Strong battery and a full tablet for her as she ages
1,Very great product very great product very great product
1,For the price this was a great tablet for my kids. They love it!!!
1,Perfect fit for what i was needing. Might get another soon.
1,Easy to set up and turn on and off restrictions. Piece of mind that daughter can't access adult appropriate content
1,"Alexa has been a great addition to my new home. Never having dealt with any smart home devices and wanting to start, I found Alexa user friendly and the additional apps and services a nice touch. Can't wait to see what new tech and features Alexa has to offer in the future."
1,I bought this product as a Christmas gift and the person who received it loves it. They use it for their kids entertainment.
1,Best tablet buy for my son . It's perfect for the games he plays
1,"Love this book reader. Easy to use, easy to load books, easy to read even in the dark! Easy on eyes! It's like reading a real book. Charge lasts weeks!"
1,Great improvement from the original version and much better than apple tv
1,"I absolutely love my amazon echo! The echo has so many features, it really is like having a personal assistant. You can get music, news, books and more on demand. The echo is easy to link to any accounts, and easy to link up with any home devices compatabile with the echo. The sound quality is great, and the range is excellent as well. Highly recommend!!"
1,Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.
1,Bought this for reading but enjoy all the features from books to movies
1,Great great great great great great great great tablet.
1,Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it
1,I find this perfect for reading. It's much lighter than the mini iPad. Easier on the eyes.
1,Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
1,This is a great tablet for the price. We have 3 of them now one for each family member. Easy to use and does everything that the high priced tablets do.love them never had a bad issue yet
1,"it is a good product. But does not work well for some cases, for example, user with different noise environment, and different accent. Some times the searched results are funny. Also, hope it support other languages. Also Price too high."
1,Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
1,Text is clear. Nice not to have the battery die every few days like a conventional tablet.
0,It reboots sometimes but it beats paying cable bill
1,"I like the fact that Amazon keeps evolving the device, making it able to do new things. It is great for playing music at home because the sound quality for such a small device is excellent. The shopping list feature is also nice because anyone with the Alexa app and your Amazon account can check to see whats on the list."
1,Works very well. Compatable with lots of programs.
1,This tablet is amazing works really good ...........
0,"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination"
1,"I really like the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet. I would recommend it."
1,We bought 3 of these for niece and nephews and they absolutely love it. The price is very reasonable for the product.
1,Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well.
1,so far it has been working really well especially for the one's it was bought for. It's their first time using one and everything seems to work well. It takes real nice picture's and is very durable.
1,We were already a prime member so no extra cost for service
1,Got this for my nine year old daughter and she loves it. Works great for her to watch Netflix and play games and anything she likes doing.
1,"I really like the echo alexa. I started the digital age in my home. Little by little but it all started with alexa. I still have a long way to go. But it has been a fun journey to take. Now i can control my lights,tv,doors, music around my home. My 2 year old daughter would speak with alexa and say. ""Alexa, let it go"" the frozen song will come up."
1,One of the best streaming devices out and at a affordable price
1,"i bought it for my 2 year old, he loves it and will not put it down until he fall asleep"
1,OTT= Over the Top digital television is the wave of the future for the TV industry. Amazon Fire TV is leading this revolution.
1,is a very good box work very good with wifi with movie tv show and a lot more with family tonight.
1,"I bought this as a gag gift for my wife. She returned the other gift (a bottle of perfume) but uses this device every day. Music plays, shopping lists get made, and the daily news is caught up on in no time. Alexa is pretty good at converting units when I cook and need to know how many tablespoons are in a liter, handsfree timer requests are easy to do and I find myself looking for ways to add more of these clever little devices. I would highly recommend this to all, in fact I'm off to buy one for my parents."
1,Love this product as it help makes my home into a smart home with added security.
1,"Bought to replace my original kindle and have access to books already purchased. Have used it for so much more like games, browsing internet, and watching netflix. Does so much more than original at a better price."
1,This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
1,"This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy."
1,I wanted something my granddaughter could watch different things on while in the car. She loves it and so do I.
1,"Amazon really hit the ball out of the park with this one, the Echo is great!"
1,My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!
1,I live these. Slowly replacing dots in our large rooms with echos. The sound quality is close to a nose system
1,"This newer version has better back lighting, also much easier to use. I definitely would recommend this for those who want a dedicated reader. The battery life is much improved too."
1,I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
1,This is awesome! I have a 4 year old grandson and he loves the tablet!!It's kid friendly and has great games that he likes!!Would recommend it!!My 9 year grandson also traded in his drawing pad for a tablet and he loves it!!
1,Think it will work out. Could be missing the larger storage of the 16gb which I bought for myself. Hard to say really.
1,"I'm a gadget guy and I've been watching this product for a while. I've read and read about the capabilities and finally decided to pull the trigger when I saw it on the shelf. It's been about 3 weeks now and I've learned a lot of the features. Alexa can tell you the forecast, your commute, and even some dad jokes. The sound quality is much better than most of my other Bluetooth speakers but she has to be plugged in all the time, no internal battery with this model. Right now it seems like more of a novelty in my kitchen but I plan on adding some home automation to get my money's worth. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the hardware or AI but it is difficult to add extra capabilities or ""skills"" through the necessary app because you have to scroll through all of them sequentially. The developers should add categories or a search function by capability. Last I checked there were 2 other models will the same AI capabilities and at lower price points. Read some more reviews and articles and find the one you can justify dropping $100+ on. You'll like it!"
0,I purchased the tablet as a screen for my drink and it worked just fine
1,I had a Nook for several years but did not get good service from Barnesand Noble so I switched to the Amazon Kindle and I am sooooo happy!
1,My husband bought one and really liked the tablet could fit in his pocket
1,"Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
1,This was a Mother's Day gift from my son. I had wanted one for awile. It has surpass my expectations. I love it.
1,It's amazing what it can do for the family. A lot of fun
1,The text is easier to read and I don't have to have a light in order to read when the room light is dim or if it is dark.
1,Great tablet for the price. Much better than the cheaper brands.
1,"Great tablet but low internal storage and does not allow for much ""customization"" of the home screen and other screens."
1,Great plug in to charge my device
1,She runs the lights in the house and is full of knowledge. My man loves her because she is the only female in this house that doesnt talk back to him.
1,Will Suggest this tablet to my friends. Yes I would suggest this product to my friends. I will purchase some for Christmas Gifts.
1,"It's a good E-reader, and the service at Best Buy store was perfect."
1,"It is exactly what we wanted. Great product we love it Great service, quick and gave us exactly what we wanted."
1,I bought this for my four year old nephew. He is enjoying it.
1,"The tablet meets my immediate needs of email, games, even social networking. Also pleased with streaming of my favorite site. A little slow but maybe the network. Also Amazon's technical service was excellent. I had a bad day and was frustrated with start up which is easy when in your right mind, anyway the technician deescalated excellently."
1,"I have always loved the Kindle products. This is my first Paperwhite and I am incredibly pleased with it. Very lightweight, the touchscreen aspect doesn't get in the way of things, and the backlight doesn't compromise the e-ink quality of feeling like I'm reading on paper."
1,"This is an excellent price for the Amazon Fire 7 Tab, I highly recommend to product!"
1,"I bought this item for my boyfriend, he loves it he loved it so much he bought a few for Christmas gift thank you"
1,"Gave 3 out to kids for gifts, the kids love them. Will see how they hold up. They are not Ipads but for the price they are well worth it, right now"
1,"We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!"
1,"bought for my friends, but good enough! why need so many comments?"
1,"This was a Christmas present for my wife's sister. She is tech challenged, after I initially set it up for her, she has really been enjoying streaming music and talk radio"
1,Tablet is great for surfing the Internet and downloading movies to watch on the airplane.
1,This product is perfect for reading alongside my computer while I type.
1,"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
1,"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices."
1,"Bought it for my son and for now is working great, hope this one last longer than the others, my son loves it, can play, can watch movies, music, etc."
1,"After about 2 months of use, I can say that my wife and i are very happy with our purchase. The Amazon Paperwhite kindle is exactly what we wanted for ... reading literature. We tried to many times to duplicate the effect with a tablet but found the shiny glare to be too much. The paperwhite is easy on the eyes, and easy to use. I did give it 4 stars instead of 5, because after purchasing I learned there is slightly more expensive version (like $20 more) that doesn't include the frequent ads were where having to deal with. Luckily we were able to find out how to pay Amazon an extra $20 to eliminate the ads, but it would have been nice to not have to deal with it at all. I would recommend anyone looking at this product get the version for $20 more and eliminate the annoyance of the ads."
1,The fire works fine it's not the fastest but for basic browsing and watching videos it works great. You can't beat it for the price. Great for kids and not having to worry about them breaking it.
1,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.
1,Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
1,Christmas gift for my son. He absolutely loves his echo and his echo dot. He is able to command it to turn the lights on and off and loves it turns his computer on and off. It does so much stuff
1,It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.
0,"Meets expectations consistent with the price. I don't really use it for anything. It simply can't replace my iPad. Both the screen quality and battery life are poor relative to my iPad 4 from a few years ago, so I haven't found a use for this Kindle Fire. Generally it just feels cheap and the user interface not as clean as the iPad. I think it's value is consistent with the low price point."
0,"Had this, have the dot, have two Google homes. I prefer Google home. You can YouTube rhere differences. Alexa is okay but nothing extraordinary. I use it to turn on lights, and that's about it."
1,one of the best media player options for streaming TV
1,Alexa still has a lot to learn. She doesnt know enough about sports and tv listings.
1,I've had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge.
1,This device has a great sound that fills the room. It is easy to use and voice commands are convenient.
1,I've purchased several for family members and everyone is loving all the content available. Easy purchase may be back for more!!
1,"This product is worth the price. Apple TV may have better features and can link to your laptop and phone, but for the price, Amazon Fire TV is great!"
1,great purchase very pleased with our tablet!!!!!!!
1,"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
1,"We had purchased these same tablets for our kids for Christmas and we really liked them. I like that they have kindle unlimited. I don't constantly have to buy books, like with my Nook. $10 a month for unlimited and I can read all the books I want"
0,I purchased the firebox for tv in living room. I later purchased fire stick for bedroom. The box downloads faster. Amazon has lots of good movies and tv shows. Excellent music selection
1,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
1,"I NEEDED this as part of my SmartThings home automation system. I was waiting for a sale and got this when it was $50 off.It does everything that the manual said that it will do, works great.A bonus is that, alongst with using it to control my automation, I can also use it as a bluetooth speaker. And it sounds great."
1,Steve Wright is a well informed and very good rep for Best Buy. Steve assisted me in the selection and ordered this out of stock item just in time for Christmas. Thank you.
1,Wonderful product to have for toddlers and preschoolers.
1,"Great product, So useful around the house especially with being able to turn on the lights using alexa"
1,WORKS WELL FOR ME DON'T NEED CABLE TV CAN STREAM ALL MY PROGRAMS WITH FIRE TV
1,Great product. Exactly what we thought. Ordered online and came quickly.
1,This product works perfectly for our family's needs.
1,This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
0,"I really love how this product works. It is fast and easy to use when the erthernet cable is connected to the router. The WiFi distance to the router is very poor. You almost have to put it next to the router. My TV is about 50 feet from the router and I am able to use nextflix WiFi without any lag, but the Amazon fire TV is not in range. It is in range right next to the router."
1,"Bought 2 of these for my parents and they love them. My mom has a smart phone so she does pretty good with hers, my dad has a flip phone, but seems to have no problem figuring it out."
1,This is a good product for the price. It does do the basic things right. It however would need a bunch of features to be added to make it a great product.
1,This does just what it claims and also has a great speaker so you do not need to link with a sound system to be able to enjoy! We compared this to google and with the speaker there was no comparison this one is so much better.
1,Love the kindle products. I bought the original kindle years ago so this is a nice upgrade.
1,A little complicated in the beginning when opening the apps but once you get the hang of it then it's easy and fast.
1,"Hue lights, Spotify and everything are all connected with her"
1,"Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device."
1,I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
1,Great little streaming device. Mainly use for Netflix and Playstation Vue
1,I purchased 2 of the Amazon Fire and I am very pleased not only with the product but the price was fantastic. The children are thrilled and they have found it very easy to operate.
1,My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn't cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free
0,Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
0,"If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable."
1,"I personally has Kindle vovage. Paperwhite has flash on every page turn, which is bit not good reading experience"
1,Price was right and works like a champ. Bought for my mom and she loves it
1,Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad
1,Whole family is enjoying it! Kids and we are both able to use and user friendly.
1,It allows you to focus on your reading and not wandering to the internet. Great for reading in the dark. No need to buy a small lamp to read in the dark and easy to read in the daylight. Battery last a long time.
0,This a great tablet for the parents who enjoy playing games.
0,"I initially liked the product, the work it does and with the speakers. But then with time you feel bored, in specific if you are listener of hindi music as the songs are repetitive. Amazon Unlimited Music does not holds a very good library of Hindi Music. Secondly, Alexa is probably tuned to answer more of ""I don't know"". After purchasing, I realized and read more reviews that Google Home provides much better answers to queries put against it and has a wide range of hindi music."
1,"I love this tablet. It works very well. I bought it because I love to read ebooks and read the Bible app. Having a 7"" screen makes this easy.As far as apps go, it has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and tumblr available. It does not have Instagram available in the app store. I knew that going into it, because I've owned kindle fire tablets in the past.This Fire is so lightweight, and I love that. One tablet I owned previously was almost too heavy for my purse.This tablet has a browser, called the Silk browser, and it works well, although I don't use it for that.When it comes to games, the appstore has most of all the popular ones like candy crush. Pandora is also available.This Fire is an excellent value for the money, and I truly mean that. Perfect for kids too"
1,"perfect for kids. reading, internet, Netflix, and games"
1,I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone.
0,I returned this to the store cuz I realised I didn't need music or lighting control. I replaced it with the echo dot. Disappointed because didn't know I needed wifi which I don't have.
1,The voyager is light weight and easy to hold. Love the ability to have 3G and Wi Fi. Easily was able to transfer books from my old kindle keyboard. Holds a charge for up to 2 weeks and charges quickly. Great when traveling
1,"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
1,brother-in-law had one and we messed around with it.
1,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she has used it for countless hours. She has a small crack on the screen, so I'd definitely get a case for it."
1,Amazing that Amazon beats Apple at the voice recognition game. Great product.
1,Bought this tablet for my 7 year old. It doesn't have the best amount of memory but it does have a spot for a mini SD card. It's pretty durable and easy to use.
1,"Love it, great quality. Nice picture, so good. !!!!"
1,"Bought this for my wife for Xmas. Also bought 3 more for each of my kids. Great interface, easy to use. Suggest buying a memory card as well for storage of all the apps."
1,I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.
1,"Echo is great, I love that I can just say play my music, or play Christmas music or what's the weather,"
1,my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.
1,"Way better than the fire stick. Has a Ethernet port, also can use sd cards"
1,This is an awesome little inexpensive tablet. It isn't the fastest but it gets the job done well. I just surf the web and watch videos online. I also downloaded the Spotify app and listen to music. Next I'll download Netflix. It gets the job done very well.
1,This amazon fire tv box is amazing. The picture quality is awesome
1,Kindle allows me to bring all my favorite read with me on the road. Great backlight feature and anti-glare are both nice features.
1,I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.
1,Just hooked it up works great don't know how I ever got by without it
1,This was on my wife's Christmas list. She loves it. Easy to use.
1,"Since the most recent update, we really like the fire tv. We like that the fire tv includes an alexa remote since we have our lights connected to our dot. Before watching a film, we can dim the lights using the remote. The interface of the fire tv obviously emphasizes Prime video so it may be useless for those non-Prime users; however, Fire tv has a lot of apps that you can use. I was disappointed that VUDU was not on fire tv, though."
1,Perfect tablet for my 4 yr old grandson. Easy to use.
1,games are excellent and great books to read as well
1,Just perfect. Thank you!!
1,Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
1,"The Echo has become an integral part of our lives. From turning lights on/off to playing music, getting news briefs or sports score and asking it questions whether important or silly, Echo lives up to its expectations. If you are in to home automation it is a good solid start. Amazon adds new Skills by the day that you can enable from the free Alexa app. Once you buy an Echo you will want another another or 2 more. Skynet is here, Embrace it."
1,A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.
1,I'm enjoying the Echo a lot! It has been pretty simple to use. We are planning to move into a new house and I'm excited to try all the automation features I can use with this. Great product!
1,Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
1,This is very nice! The paperwhite is great on the eyes!!
1,I love it! It's simple and easy! I love how you can take anywhere and Alexa listens to you right away!
1,Was a gift for a friend who enjoys how convenient and light it is.
1,Wow factor only limited by your inquisitive mind love it
1,It was a gift for my wife. She wanted to listen to music in the kitchen. Sometimes it disconnects from the internet.
0,Alexa- STEP UP YOUR GAME. Google home is coming for you. He coming!
1,"I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go."
1,I got this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old son and he absolutely loves it. It is very user friendly and I love the parental controls.
1,"It makes life simpler if I want to play some music all I have to do is tell Alexa and the music play's, if I want to know the weather, make a shopping list Alexa helps you out . The amazon echo is pretty handy."
1,"Device makes an excellent personal internet access machine! Some apps don't load on the device, but those are few and far between. Great music player as well as good interface with online streaming services such as Netflix. No need for a DVD player for the kids with this!"
1,This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading
1,"Gave this tablet to my daughter for Xmas, now she can enjoy playing her games on the tablet"
1,"I have owned a Kindle since the second generation came out, but this device is by far the best bang for the money. Less expensive than the Voyage, the new Paperwhite looks crisper than the previous generation, feels good in my hands, and allows me to read in the dark comfortably without bothering those around me. Highly recommended!"
1,Does the job it���s suppsed to. Get it and enjoy life in the fast lane
1,Better than older kindles. Reading a book on a kindle is easier than holding a book.
1,"Out of the box there really is nothing to do but plug it in to the USB drive and you're ready to go. You get a pop up reminder asking if you want to use the drive as a back up. If you select yes or no that will be the last time you see it. If you say ""decide later"" it will come up each time you plug it in to the USB drive."
1,"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle."
1,Very happy with the Amazon echo So happy I went and bought another one
1,"We bought this for my 6 year old. He loves it. Make to sure to buy an additional memory card, because it's memory is small, but for my 6 year old to play games and read books, it does it's job!"
1,"I love the ease of use, it better than the apple siri"
1,She is a problem sometimes but getting better and our Alexa is learning as we speak to her more more.. fun
0,"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something."
1,Echo is more than handy. It's also fun for the grandkids. They have a blast testing Alexa. Works great while internet is functioning. Also bought light bulbs compatible with Echo. They work as advertised.
1,Bought for a first time tablet user with little technology aptitude so works great to get there toe wet in using a touch screen simple easy and cheap
0,"Price is low, but OS is lacking unlike other brands it doesnt come with a decent charger. To refill battery you have to charge it overnight."
1,I got it for my brother and he loved it! He loved how small the box is and how it doesn't take to much space.
1,"Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer."
1,"The Charger is not lasting, Screen is ok,Functionality good. size to small but for the price is ok.Worst thing is the charger and battery life."
1,We bought it just for fun but now we can't live without it. We have 3 and use them everyday. Trust me buy and Alexa you'll love it
1,"I always read books on paper and thought it would not be the same to use a kindle, but now I'm totally happy with it. Thanks to it now I read more when commuting, traveling, ... as it is a very handy and light product."
1,App selection is very difficult too much Amazon sales have not been able to get my Reward Zone points tried to purchase app but was unsuccessful
1,Perfect size and features for my 9 year old daughter..fire is made well..she loves it to read and to play games on
1,"Processor is relatively slow, but it is functional especially for mundane low intensity task. Only board memory can be enchanced with Micro SD cards."
1,This is an excellent product at a great price. Shipping was great and got here really quick. Product itself is incredible and makes reading very easy and comfortable. Easy on eyes whether in the dark or in bright sunlight.
1,Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.
1,"I like this product. I have the fire stick, but wanted to move to a faster processor so I could run Kodi. Works well."
1,"When I bought this product I never expected it to be anything like this. It has got decent screen quality and response time. Definitely worth the price. Requires amazon account to install apps, read books etc."
1,This tablet was a perfect gift and at the right price for my 6yr old niece. She absolutely loves it.
1,Good for reading at night. Bought as a gift and it is used daily for reading
1,I love the Amazon echo. I use it every day for news and weather updates. I listen to music with it and it's sound is really good. I have now purchased 5 of them for other family members and we talk back and forth through the echo.
1,I was very dissatisfied in my first visit to this store but this time I had a luck and I had a good client advisor. He did help me to find what I wanted.
1,"overall i like echo.. i just wish opening apps was a bit easier. maybe i read the directions wrong. but i suppose with time it will get better. i hope i dont have to buy a new one in 5 years cuz i dont play ""keep'n up w'em joneses""."
1,It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.
0,Bought for grandchild who is 10 and she loves it. Easy for her to handle and navigate. Price was awesome!
1,"I put off getting an e-reader for a long time thinking to myself that one more gadget was not necessary. Now that I have the Paperwhite, it's going to be my constant companion. It's very user friendly. I am brushing up on my Swedish language, and I was able to download a Swedish English dictionary so I can now not only read my Swedish books, but I am also able to look up unfamiliar words with ease. The display is very easy on the eyes - no eye strain whatsoever. All in all, I'm extremely satisfied."
1,Works well and easy to use. This is a great Camera for the price
1,"Love it, screw cable. I save a lot of money every month"
1,The only thing I don't like is the power plug it sometimes don't want to charge
1,Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.
1,i purchased this for my wife to read books on she enjoys it
1,Good for the price hard to beat it!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,My girls love the tablet. Great value for the money.
1,This is my third Kindle and I love them! The advantage to this one is I can read it easily with no other lights on.
1,I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product.
0,"For the money, this tablet is an amazing piece of hardware. Well constructed, good fit and finish, good battery life.BUT putting non-Amazon software on the tablet is a pain, a real pain.I purchased this for my granddaughter and wanted two things, (1) YouTube and (2) Skype. It took about 2 hours to put these two apps on the tablet. In the end, I returned the tablet and purchased an Insignia (BB house brand) tablet instead."
1,"There are a few things I like about the device. I like the remote. I like that I have access to Amazon Prime (video and music). I like that Direct TV Now is available. However, there are a few things that need to improve on the Fire TV. One, I've had more buffering issues on this device than I have had on my Apple TV or Roku box. Two, Alexa is a joke. Very little that she actually does. Three, the App Store is not as vast as other services."
1,I needed something for a young kid and this tablet was suggested to me from a sales person at Best Buy. The kid loves it.
1,"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag."
1,"It sits there all day at the ready. You can just ask it a question like math or unit conversion. You can ask about the weather. Ask it to play music; turn the volume up or down, skip, or restart."
1,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
1,Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
1,GREAT TABLET FOR THE PRICE. KIDS LOVE IT. CANT BEAT IT.
1,"I love my Kindle. If you're a bookaholic like me, there is no cheaper way to read. Once you've made your initial investment, there are literally hundreds of books available for free, or 99 cents and other low prices. Subscribe to a service that notifies you of these deals and you're all set."
1,"Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive."
1,I tried my new Amazon Fire TV box. Worked as advertised.
1,I bought this for my grandmother and she can't put it down
1,Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
1,We needed something to be able to stream all of our subscription services. A friend told us a fire stick would be perfect since we have prime and this turned out perfect!!!
1,This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
1,My grand daughter loves it and so do her parents! Very durable. I'd highly recommend this product
1,"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
1,Bought this tablet to read books and it also has other good qualities.
1,The Amazon Echo is both practical and fun. I use it for my Sirius XM streaming music. I check the weather often and I use it to tease my cats by asking Alexa to meow. There are so many answers to questions and an abundance of information that Alexa can provide. These are only a fraction of all the things that the Echo can do. Love the Echo !
1,"I love this Kindle. It is a replacement for my old kindle keyboard. I used it constantly, for hours every day, carried it in my purse all the time, and traveled with it. I will not be without a Kindle. nice product."
1,"Great gift, for my kid's second birthday! This product is very child friendly and easy to use! I recommend this product for families!"
1,Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.
1,Easy set up. Fun to use. Great sound quality. Highly recommend.
1,Easy to read and set up. Enjoy the ability to read with the back light.
1,Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.
1,I purchased this as a gift for a friend who really just wanted to have a device to play games. It was perfect for him. He can do so much more with this tablet. It is a great tablet for the price!
1,I bought this tablet for my little nephew and he loved it. Perfect for downloading apps on the go and keeping the kids busy on the road. Easy to access the wifi. Memory is ok but I knew that buy the cost. Would recommend for basic use.
1,I love this. Sold 4 Apple tvs including 4th generation.
1,"My granddaughter loves this. She was using my old smart phone to get online, but then I got this and she loves the bigger screen and it is easy to use for a six year old."
1,Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don't like is that I can't add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that's to be expected.
1,"What could be better than a book? A Kindle Voyage! This wonderful device is easier to carry around than a book. Whenever I need to wait a few minutes, I whip out my Kindle. It is clear, it works for a long time without recharging, and it receives new books instantly. I had been using an Ipod with audio books for a long time but I got tired of the difficulty in searching for material. It also lost my place unless I was extremely careful. This device is lightweight and slips easily into my handbag or pocket. I also bought the Origami case - with it, the Kindle comes on automatically when it is opened. A great and useful device - I love it!"
1,"This is my 2 nd kindle. I bought this because of the lighting option. It is great product, but I think little bit over priced. It runs perfectly for my need."
1,I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
1,"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting."
0,The tablet periodically shuts off for no reason. I have contacted Amazon but their only suggestion was to reset to factory default.
1,Just what you need for an ereader. Front lighting is very natural and doesn't give me a headache like trying to read on backlight screen like my iPad.
1,This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
1,Alexa is a very good product. It is nice in appearance and style. Voice quality is good and clear. Alexa should offer more products to folks who don't have amazon prime just to keep interest in the product. It is a little pricy along with extra items you need to buy to get alexa to give more functions.
1,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
1,"Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself"
1,My daughter loves it! She spends hours upon hours on it!
1,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
1,Had some freezing. But still works good. Will buy another one for a bedrooms..
1,"Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast."
1,This Kindle is great. Customer service rep for technical questions---not so much.
0,"Although this got great reviews, I am still trying to figure it out. When it doesn't understand my question I rephrase it and sometimes even then Alexa still can't answer. I have been reading about how to get the most out of Alexa but I'm actually still on the fence about whether or not I will keep it. Am I missing something? What is it that others see that I don't?"
1,"Extra features are nice and upgrading from the Kindle Paperwhite was fairly simple. Amazon did an automatic system update which was not cool. There should have been an option to update when we wanted, not when they wanted."
1,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy
0,I have to unplug it and wait 30 seconds every time
1,Picked this up for a birthday present. Had previously purchased one for myself. This is the perfect tablet for any age. The Google Play store can also be sideloaded.
1,I debated for over a year about getting a Kindle. After trying to read my tablet outside this summer with sunglasses and sitting under an umbrella...I finally bought my Kindle Paperwhite. I couldn't be happier and I've read more books in the past couple of months then I have in years. It's as good as they say and easy to read in ANY light!
1,I use it everyday! I absolutely love my echo! Best Buy ever!!
1,Great item for a fraction of the price of an ipdad
1,"This is a great tablet for the price. Currently using it for 3 year old. Love the parent timers and settings. Only negative is with no physical button, going back or 'home' is little harder than other tablets. It isn't the fastest tablet either but works well if you use it for very basic needs"
1,Great tablet for the price. However the battery drains quickly
1,I have an Amazon Kindle and this one. The kindle from Best Buy comes with some features that the Amazon Kindle doesn't have or offer like screensavers.
1,Easy to maneuver. And great case for protection. The battery does not keep a charge long but I'm used to the iPad.
1,"Still learning the capabilities of Alexa, bot, so far very impressed."
1,"Alexa is a fun tool if you have Amazon Prime. You can dictate songs, set timers, talk to her if you have no friends. Pretty fun."
1,This tablet serves its purpose well. Plenty powerful for an e-reader and basic web surfing. Apps are limited to the versions Amazon has which may not be the latest version compared to the Google store. There is a way to get Google apps on this tablet if you do a little research.
1,This newest version of Fire works great! Responds fast to opening apps and speed of browser is quick. The color choices are nice too!
1,Bought for my kids and they love it! Amazon on top again
1,The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. I love being able to watch my favorite shows and movies. I'm not a techy person but this was pretty easy to set and use. I like the taking remote. You can ask Alexa anything.
1,This product is easy to use and you definitely get what you paid for. It is also easy to insall.
1,Bought this for a family member and he loves it. Great value for the price!
1,Got this for my grandson. He loves it. Get price. Bought the large one for the living room.
1,Got this for my wife she loves it and syncs with her iPhone or just plays music
1,One is adopting an animal to give it a good home - the other is buying an Alexa enable device like the ECHO. This marvel of tech is a must have that brings us one step closer to life on the USS Enterprise.
1,"Useful in the kitchen, and for home automation. Would compare it to Google Home before picking one up at this time of the year."
1,"Bought as Christmas gift. He loves it. Small, light, fast, great selection of apps. Plus you can't go wrong with the warranty."
1,"Fun to use! Must download apps to be able to respond properly to request. Example, translation and music. I love that you can listen to music and news."
1,"Bought this one for my daughter for Christmas, but I have one and like it very much."
1,The Amazon Echo was easy to set up and works as advertised. Shipping was very quick. Received it a couple of days earlier than expected.
1,got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
1,It is easy to use and has a lot of great features. It has a fairly decent camera. It is a good size
1,Tablet is good for it's cost. Works cool. Not used much so far.
1,As a speaker it just does the job where it excells is as a home automation controolled
1,"Easy to carry; easy to read. Easy to get books and download. Nice to have a dictionary within your book. Able to download books, newspapers or magazines."
1,"I had been researching ways to forego using cable television in the future and it seems this was good start. Haven't quite figured it all out yet but so far, so good."
0,Just wish it would learn faster. Seems like the Google home has better knowledge with Internet info.
1,This is one of the best purchases i have ever made
1,My 5 year old loves his tablet. It's perfect for him.
1,"I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the tablet. I had watched the prices go up and down on Amazon. I wish I had bought one when they were $29.99. I also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. I had a trip coming up that I didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. I was glad that I did. I was able to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go (HBO Now) and YouTube with no problems. It is a great tablet for the price. I also have some books loaded to read later. I have been using my Kindle touch for that. If you do buy this tablet I would suggest getting a memory card."
0,It is a nice little tablet for on the go or for kids. Wouldn't recommend using it for work
1,My eight year old loves the games and it is safe for her to use.
1,Excellent product with a multitude of uses . Love the fact that it is expandable.
1,I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.
1,Happy with purchase would recommend! Always happy !
1,Purchased two of these for my kids. They are not the fastest tablets but provide good options and connectivity for kids use. Games work great.
1,I bought this for my child and she loves it it does everything she wants it to do and more
1,It's a surprise to getting this kindle in this price. And it's a great device to read books.
1,"Useful around the house, put it in the kitchen and can use it for timers, reminders, asking for sports scores (faster than changing the channel on the TV and checking myself). ""Tell me a joke"" is usually pretty good, too.Now looking into connecting other things to it, like light switches, etc."
1,I bought this as a mother's day gift for my mother. She has not had much experience with tablets. This was a perfect choice for her. Doesn't do anything. Crazy but works great for free to play games and kindle books and apps.
1,"Bought this for my 9 year old, he loves it. Great buy"
1,Very easy to use. My bf loves it. Good price.recommend it
1,"works out of the box, no problems with setup. connects to all the popular streaming apps like hulu amazon prime netflix"
1,This is a great tablet for the price... Works excellent... Memory card capability makes it even better..
1,Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
1,Love the camera and many features!!! Almost like having a laptop.
1,The tablet is small and a great tool for road trip with the kids. It keeps them entertained and is small enough for them to carry in a small backpack.
1,My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to
1,Amazon fire tv pretty nice highly recommend. 5 star item.
1,"Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet!"
1,"I did get this on sale right before the holidays. I was looking for a Kindle with at a minimum back lighting. Though it doesn't solve all of the glare issues, it actually made for a great tablet at a very low cost price."
1,great for watching movies in the teeny tiny airline seats! love it and Best Buy has great customer service
1,Great product and very useful for weather and traffic reports.
1,"This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone."
1,Not very fancy but works for what I need. I primarily got it for reading books. I like that you can switch to night light.
1,"We bought this tablet right before a trip out-of-town, and it was a good purchase. Eight-year-olds crave entertainment, and the Amazon Fire gives plenty of that.It's been easy to handle, and hasn't had any issues breaking down.The charger cable is a pain to plug into the tablet (only the part that fits into the tablet itself), and some of the tablet versions of apps like Neko Atsume aren't good compared to the phone versions, but we are overall very happy with our purchase."
1,"Expandable memory option was a big plus, 4k video output when streaming video is great and I was able to load programs to watch free movies and ppv."
1,"One of the best pieces of electronic I have purchased for my wife. She loves, the music, lists, information, etc. Got her a button for her jewelry room."
1,Its great for small task and an excellent reader.I can even do my online school work.
1,"This is the best streaming box for the money, it does favor amazon content."
1,This is awesome. The updated features work well. Really fast an smooth. The light dimming is great the best feature on the new kindle.
1,"This is a very cool item. The voice recognition does not work great when playing music, but still good product"
1,So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too.
1,"For the price that I paid for this tablet, ut is a great deal. It does exactly what i bought ir for"
1,"I know this was a 7"" screen, but it seems much smaller compared to my ipad.. It works fairly well, just wish I could change some of the screens around so I didn't have to scroll so much. It would be nice if there was some sort of tutorial available. Works well for games.."
1,"a solid well made tablet that feels good in the hand. images are crisp & clean. works well with my hulu acct, hbogo acct, prime video acct too. the first few secs the video is blurry, then it clears up and plays fine. if you add a sd card the tablet automatically places apps & video on the sd card (if app allows) the great value for me is you can download amazon prime video (must be a current member) onto the sd card for offline viewing. i bet a lot of parents will love that for those long car trips. sound is good. BT worked well with my BT enabled stereo ( i streamed prime music & pandora). don't be put off by the screen resolution - it looks great. the new bellini OS is a MAJOR improvement over the old carousel format of days past. the new amazon app underground also adds to the value for prime members. the lock screen ads are not intrusive, once you swipe to unlock tablet they go away and do not reappear until you lock the screen again. if you're a prime member - this is the best 50 bucks you will spend!"
1,Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain
1,"I have 2 Echo Dots, and this is a great addition. Super bass for listening to music. BB had a great sale."
1,Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!
1,"I use my Fire every day. I'm very satisfied with it's performance and size. The battery last a long time, so I can use the Kindle for hours without recharging."
0,I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
1,Excellent quality and durability for a young child
1,You can absolutely not beat a Kindle fire. Unless you are my 7 year old son. Haha. But seriously at the price and the beatings they take they are worth it every time and with the cloud storage I don't even mind having to replace it every year.
1,"I use this for playing music, alarms and control a few smart home devices. Great to see everything works flawless."
1,this was perfect for when the grandchildren are over. we have ten from age 2 thru 13 and they all love it. i even enjoy using it
1,"Bought this to use to read my textbook on trips when I didn't want to carry my laptop. Fits what I needed perfectly. Lightweight, and the battery is lasting a long time. Easy to set up."
1,"I bought this device and put it in my new theater room. I love the games and streaming. I have yet to upgrade to 4K through Netflix, but I am excited to try it out on here when I do. I am just waiting for a bit more content."
1,I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
1,I love my Kindle. I like the fact that I can read books or go onto the Internet to look up my news. Definitely can not beat the low price for everything it does.
1,Worth the price. Very light and love that it's personal
1,I got this on sale. It's hard to imagine getting any more value for such a low price.
0,Luckily best buy exchanged the kindle fire for a Lenovo tablet with courtesy and ease. Thank you best buy! It was a black Friday purchase that I did nothing with until late January/ early February. Great way to do business and therefore keep it.
1,I bought this tablet for my wife to play games on and read her books- she loves it! It was easy to set up and get going quickly!
1,"Replaced my old Kindle Fire with this White Paper. Wasn't sure if I would like it without the color screen and WiFi connection, however, with my Smartphone I really don't need those functions anymore."
1,Great product very easy to use . Very pleased. Would purchase again and again . New personal friend
1,it is a great product. I would recommend this to a friend
1,My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
1,Can play almost all songs that I request for.. Very helpful when asked about weather forecasts and news.. Great source of entertainment for me and my husband!
1,"Snappy and reliable performance. This is exactly what I expected its little brother to be. Works great with our system. We generally use our Echo as the speaker and they work well together. My only real complaint is the lack of certain apps, Vudu in particular, but I can't blame that on the device or its manufacturer - that falls to the app developers."
1,"Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps."
1,i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system
1,I bought the new Kindle Fire for my wife because I have a previous version of the Fire and love it. She hasn't really used it much but I have. It is a bit slower than previous versions but looks great and is a great value!
1,Easy to use once I realized I needed to hold longer to turn the kindle off.
1,The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand and lighting is noticeably improved
1,This is one of the fastest smoothest android boxes.
1,Very fast and reliable fits easy behind tv upload apps and view video in 4000k
1,"The sound is better at mid to low volumes, but at max the voices are great... I also have the Echo tap and the echo dot... They all work Great,,, This one for sure has a bigger sound..."
1,"Have 2 younger kids always trying to grab my cell or tablets for stuff. Grabbed up 2 of these and was pleasantly surprised. Hold charge well, durable, and perfect for kids and learning apps"
1,Gave as a gift to niece in hospital she loved it. Was able to do everything on the tablet she wanted to. Easy to use I was the one who set it up for her was very simple.
1,Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product
1,Just looking for an affordable tablet and found this one...very pleased!
1,It performed the way it said it would and more!Awesome buy!
1,This Amazon Fire TV works great with my apps to see other providers
1,"Sweet product by Amazon, as usual. It's legit, most definitely"
1,"This tablet is fast, expendable and cheap! It runs the Android OS, which houses most of the games and apps you'll find on any Android phone. My only complaints with this tablet are the screen and cameras. The screen becomes washed out at a 45 degree angle or more and the cameras are unusable due to the noise they produce. Otherwise, this is a really great product!"
1,Once you learn some of the invocations - it becomes easier to have Alexa reply to your command/requests.
1,We absolutely love our amazon echo. We use it a lot for music
0,This was a replacement for my son who's original kindle broke. He likes it a lot. Just wish we could figure out how to get all the old content we had bought from the old one into the new one.
1,My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
1,"Wish, it recognize other languages other than English and has a Kid's mode."
1,Paperwhite excels while reading on sunlight - like beach etc. I strongly recommend it
1,I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
0,I honestly didn't care for it. The newest versions of this tablet are by far much better. You have a bit more freedom with it than you do the older version.
1,"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."
1,Git this tablet for my daughter. She is loving it!
0,As a starter tablet for a child this is great because it offers everything the more expensive tablets offer and it is very affordable. I wouldn't recommend this as a full service tablet because of it's speed
1,"I loooooove Alexa tower. It is so convenient & so easy to use! This item is continuously improving & updating all without any inconvenience to me & with my very busy and demanding schedule, I need all the help I can get!"
1,"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!"
0,Good speaker but limited if you don't have a big music collection. I wish it did more
1,Much better resolution than previous version and easier to use!
1,This is a great tablet for what it costs. I mostly just surf the web on it a bit but I also watch netflix and espn type streaming apps sometimes and it works great for that too.
1,"This will be your simple answer: yes, this will fulfill ALL of your cable cutting desires.I purchased this product after reading several reviews online, researching the specifications between this Amazon Fire TV and the Fire Stick (and their respective generations), and I planned my attack on making sure I fully cut away from the monopoly that is Cable/Satellite television today.Wow, not only did this completely replace my cable subscription with a company that rhymes with AP&P, but I was welcomed into an entirely new world of entertainment once I had this device up and running the way I wanted to. Which, by the way, the setup and installation is an absolute breeze, no need for installation manuals, guides, etc.Buy this, cut away from your overpriced cable, and get to entertaining yourself right now!"
1,"Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list"
1,"Plugged it in, connected to wifi and was ready to roll. 4K capability and 1080P better than cable box"
1,Incredibly fast and very affordable. I recommend it to others.
1,"Still working with it and Im still learning about but so far I like having it. Got a few things working (lights, bluetooth, music). Can't wait to get the rest of the smart items for the house."
1,"Easy to use, happy with purchase will recommend to anyone that is thinking on getting one user friendly."
1,Very happy that I decided to upgrade to the paperwhite version of the Kindle. Now I can see what I am reading. It was very difficult with the original Kindle that I received as a gift.
1,"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
1,"Once we downloaded Pandora and iHeartRadio and others on the Echo app we can listen to virtually anything. The kids like to ask Alexa to tell jokes, search facts and request music! I'm always asking her the time and she sets my alarm! So nice to not have to get up to do something. She's awesome!"
1,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
1,i like the way that it is small and easy to carry and doesnt take up alot of power
1,"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
1,It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
1,I have no idea why I did not buy this any sooner! Works awesome!
0,I bought 6 of them. They made very good christmas gifts..
1,"Bought the Fire TV because the remote could be used to control Slingbox, plus being an Amazon Prime member had access to a lot of content. Works great"
1,I bought 3 more of these for family and they love them.
1,Bought this for our 8 year old boy. Nice to have a micro sd slot. The processor seams a little slow. But seems to work sufficient enough for him. Great parental controls.
1,A great product for cord cutters!!! Works like a charm.
1,Fast processor to run my kodi. I love it. I only use it for that.
1,I have this and I also have a Roku in my den. They both have their pros and cons. I do not use the remote which came with it. I use my harmony remotes to control the devices. I also have an echo. I like the front end on the Fire TV better than the Roku. The biggest con for me is the Fire TV doesn't have the VUDU app.
1,Good overall android box quick and easy to operate
1,Gave this one as a gift. Never had any problems with mine.
1,Great price. As good as iPad mni for 200 less! Made great gift.
1,We gave these for Christmas Gifts this year and everyone was thrilled with them.
1,Works great with everything thing I use. Battery lasts long but gets hot with games.
1,Bought it on Black Friday for my aunt who isn't very technologically inclined. All she does is check her emails and watch videos on Netflix/Youtube. Works great for simple tasks such as that.
1,This is an awesome box to have. Makes it easy to watch all your shows.
1,"Love the flexibility to watch what I want! Can switch between locations in the house, and also in our second home!"
1,There are so many uses for this. From shopping online to playing music to playing games. This also can be used for homework help.
1,The Amazon ECHO with the dots placed around the house provide the perfect companion with all your daily tasks. I have Echo connected to my Hue lights and EchoBee Thermostats.
1,"This is the best and probably only e-reader that you need. Screen is beautiful and perfect with built-in light. However, I would like one with bigger screen size and hope amazon could improve reading performance on Pdf files."
1,Amazon Fire TV does a good job as a streamer the app market has a good selection of apps. I like the remote. When you use the service they do a good job of making you want to be a Prime member.
1,Just the right size for her smaller hands and she likes being just like momma.
1,Have been very satisfied so far. Had one issue (had the device for 20 days) And It would not cut on...I reset the device and it has worked so far.
1,This is a nice tablet with quality that I would expect from a higher priced unit.
1,"I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
1,"Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching Netflix,YouTube or just checking email. Love play games on it from the app store. The family loves it."
1,I own one and gave this as a gift.Nice interactive gift.
1,Great little tabletthat has all the features of a regular size tablet fast HD vibrant color in all
1,The best tablet for kids the 1 year unlimited apps is my favorite my kids love it..
1,Nice product easy to use. Enjoy it very much watching shows with the family.
1,INEXPENSIVE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL. WORKS AS GOOD AS TOP BRANDS.
1,"Bought for kids to play games on, good for what they need it."
1,"Totally satisfied. Also own Apple TV, which I ended up moving to bedroom and putting fire stick on main TV. Fire stick seems to be more ""open"" to multiple programmings compared to App Store only programs with Apple TV. But, In defense for Apple TV it's syncing abilities with my iPhone and MacBook are well received. Price wise Firestick has the advantage."
0,"Decent performance but sometime do lag a bit, screen resolution is a bit low for someone coming from a Galaxy S6 and Note 7. But for $33 (got on a sale) you can't expect top end product. Installed Google Play Store without needing root, so I can share my normal adroid app even though this is running fire OS"
1,I no longer has a cable tv bill with the exception of high speed internet. Fire TV has helped in lower my monthly expense to Comcast.
1,"Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine!"
1,Good product works as advertised use this to stream videos from my smart phone
1,I have one and bought my daughter and mama one. It's perfect for games and to down load books
1,"This device is perfect for viewing on the beach, planes, etc. Easy to use."
0,I had a hard time trying to stream movies even with a good internet connection ....was a little disappointed
1,Great product! Just as I expected!!
1,you are able adjust the brightness which is good:)
1,"I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that."
1,"Loud enough to keep a few guess entertained, it need more resources for the voice feature"
1,Love this tablet because it's durable and versatile. Glad they finally added a memory expansion slot. Highly recommend!
0,The Amazon Echo is a great item. Sometimes the echo doesn't respond to the commands or cannot answer
1,Great value and responds quickly to the touch. I bought two tablets for my college son's for Christmas. This tablet is great to connect to wifi and use to watch hulu and netflix in bed. Super!!!
1,The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
0,"While reading might be a bit easier on the Paperwhite, navigating on it drove me nuts. The touch screen is annoying and has limited functionality. I tried to like it. I just couldn't. It's sitting unused while I use a less expensive Fire."
1,The family love's asking questions. We also enjoy the shopping list and jokes.
1,Good price works great would buy again good value for the price
1,"I purchased the Echo with the dream of controlling my Ecobee Thermastat with my voice. After getting it and looking into the vast amount of ""skills"" you can add to it...It has become one of the purchases of the year for my household!"
1,This amazon echo speaker is wonderful. Great quality sound speaker for music and does so many neat things. My favorite feature is the grocery and to do list. Way to stay organized hands free!
1,"OVERALL, HAVE LOVED ITEM, EASY TO CARRY AROUND AND USE."
1,I have had my Fire for 5 years at least and love it. Bought this for my mother. Her IPad died. She is enjoying it. Her only issue is there is a game she can't download because it is on Google play.
1,"This is great for creating shopping lists, things to do, general notes that are sometimes forgotten."
1,"I am enjoying this tablet. I'm sure there are more advanced tablets available but with the price and the certificate it was practically free. This is my first electronic item with a touch screen and its fun. I'm still learning how to use all the features. I would recommend it to a friend but I think its already being replaced with the next generation 8"""
1,"My granddaughter had been using her parents' iPad and loves using apps for learning. I thought it would be nice for her to have her own tablet. My daughter loves the parental limits that can be set and my granddaughter loves not having to ""share"" with her parents!"
1,"I purchased three of these tablets to give away at work. So, while I don't have any firsthand experience, I have asked my team how they liked them.It uses the Amazon app store (of course), which is fine but doesn't even compare to the Google Play store. Even though, there are a lot of options and most big apps (Netflix, hulu, etc.) are all supported.There is also removable storage. It is very nice to be able to add a memory card to expand your memory. This is a feature a lot of tablets stopped offering.All in all, these tablets are in expensive but more reliable and sturdy than other knock off tablets from different brands. Amazon made a great bargain tablet."
1,"Got a great deal from Best Buy on Amazon Echo during a 1-day sales event. Use Echo as a countertop speaker more than anything else in our dining area/kitchen, and the sound clarity is amazing. Has turned into a great every day companion."
1,slower than my last kindle. the power button is not easy accesible when in a case.
1,"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again."
1,"Love the easy set up, and how easy it is to use. You have many different options for what to watch, with only a click of a button."
1,"This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly."
1,Has a ton of apps and is great for streaming. No more having to carry my ps4 up and down the stairs. Has all my go to apps
1,Tablet is great for children's learning games and does appear to hold up on it's own for quality and strength under close supervision. Sound is loud and image quality good. Works well with our WiFi. Price was great also.
1,I bought this for my grandson n a adult friend n they both enjoyed it. Great buy.
1,"Nice little tablet. Works great as an eReader. Easy set-up, easy to use. Like the expansion capability for memory."
1,I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.
1,"Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often."
1,"I have both the Roku 3 and Roku Stick, the Fire TV has a nicer interface although less channels. VuDu is not available for Fire TV. Fire TV speed is faster than the Roku 3 and the picture is better."
1,"I've sat on my back deck and in the bright sunshine on a beach and had no issues seeing the print. Never thought I'd like an e-reader, only a real paperback book. But, I must say, I am sold. Very lightweight."
1,"Love the Echo. Interface with Amazon Music is a great feature, and the application on my phone or kindle makes it easy to manage information or control the music. We use it mostly to listen to the radio or music library. Grand Daughter loves it because it will play whatever she asks (which is always Frozen Soundtrack)."
1,Fire Tv was easy to install and very user friendly.
1,"I have used several different streaming players/devices including the Amazon Fire TV stick and others like the Google Chromecast. I liked the Fire TV sticks but I am basically impressed with the Fire TV unit. The extra connections and microSd slot are a big plus. I also really like the voice remote. I have Kodi TV installed as well and it makes playing videos/music and viewing pictures via my home network incredibly easy. The interface is also nice looking. Overall, I am very pleased with the unit. I bought one for my 4K TV and it streams 4K content very well. It only goes to 4K mode when the UHD stream is actually playing though and stays at full HD most of the time. I liked it enough that I bought another one of my home theater room as well. I definitely recommend these units to others."
1,Bought this tablet for my son so he can play his games and keep him occupied for hours. He loves it.
1,We bought it for our granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!
1,Started with two Dots but decided buy this for the living room. Great sound and fun to use.
1,This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!
1,I have an Apple TV and The Amazon fire dreaming fire station much more.
1,It is very easy to set up and I like the fact that the answers are given in real time.
1,I got one for my grandma on Christmas and now I'm getting my son one too
1,"This is my husband's first Kindle, and he is so happy that he enjoys it. He plays on it almost every night."
1,better than I expect a and with Alexander is magical
1,As usual Amazon does it again. Fabulous ereader. Love the auto adjustment of the on board light!
1,Great for kids inexpensive wouldn't mind buying again
1,I liked it so much I bought a couple as gifts and everyone loves them. Easy for adults and kids to use. Helpful and entertaining
1,"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
1,The set up and installation were easy to do. The quality of the products is great.
1,"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase."
1,Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix
1,"There are a few things that Alexa just does not get, but I do believe a lot of it is user error on my part. She's great with playing my music, setting alarms and giving me scores to my teams. I still have to learn to be more fluid with the machine in order to get the best results. Nothing like saying, ""Alexa, can you ummmmmmm"" and it replies, ""WTH are you talking about?"" It really doesn't say that, but it might as well. The more I use it, the better I feel about the machine."
1,"It performs just as advertised, and I keep finding new tasks for her. If you love gadgets like I do this is a must have."
1,I bought it for my 4 year old nephew. He is able to use it with ease. Its a great product for the pirce
1,Amazon makes a great tablet unbelievable that it only cost $50 bucks. The processor lags just a little bit but other than that everything about this tablet I love.
0,"I purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check Facebook and watch Netflix. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that there was not a Vudu app available. I hope that one is in the development stages. I knew that this was not a full out tablet when I bought it, but had hoped that since it was based on Android, it would have the major Android apps."
1,I purchased the tablet for my mother. She is a senior and not technological. She has learned to use the tablet to pay her bills which saves a lot of time and stamps. She also plays games on the device that helps with her cognitive ability. Best purchase of the season
1,It is nice to have an extra plug
1,"My husband, kids and I have enjoy Alexa very much. Having her play music without us lifting a finger is my daughter's favorite feature."
1,Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
1,My granddaughter loves her pink tablet she is four and able to use on her own
1,"Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners."
1,It's a good product to use I suggest people buy it
1,"As you've seen in other reviews, this can break your DX. But not if you put a little double-sided tape at each right side corner, ALWAYS move the elastic band so that it holds the right edge of the Kindle into the case against the tape, and never, NEVER swing the back open. If you let your Kindle DX swing freely back and forth the way the pages in a printed book do when you hold it by both the front and back covers, the plastic part of the case will break. So don't DO that! Note in other reviews that some people even without the tape have used this case for months with no cracking of the case. I have to assume those people always move the elastic band. They might also have been reading with the case flat on a table. But if you use the tape AND the band you can read in any normal position. Note that the DX weighs 19 oz and the case weighs 12 oz. For some people the DX without case MIGHT be suitable to hold in one hand. With the case, you read with this resting in your lap, or against your knees when you lie down, or on a table. The combo is as big and heavy as a college textbook. But you can tell this is an expensively made quality product."
1,"Bought two for grandchildren ages nine and eight. Great product, good size , and good for traveling. They are very attached to them."
0,"I recommend it mostly for reading, but it's ok as a tablet."
1,"I own an Nvidia Shield, which is the current Hulk of Android Tv. The Fire TV handles media heavy lifting with the same precision."
1,I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
1,Excellent product!!! Excellent product!!! Excellent product!!! A+A+A+
1,"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
1,My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
0,"A bit dissapointed in local station reception. Fire tv is not what was expected. OK, but just not as expected."
1,I wanted a device where we could enjoy in the house as a family and that was simple enough for my wife to feel comfortable with. This exceeded my expectations and is so nice to tell Alexa to play a certain song or playlist. Great sound also!
1,If you are into reading then this is for you. I didn't think the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room. Great for reading outside.
1,"Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet."
1,"Bought two Kindle Fires, one for My Son and the Other for My Nephew, as Christmas Gifts. They were on sale for about $53.00 and I must say that it was very well worth it. The size, weight and portability is amazing. My Boys get to watch all their favorite shows and take pictures. It keeps them busy while I get done housework. I'm extremely glad I chose the Kindle Fire and I would definitely buy again and recommend to a friend. Fyi, My Son is 6, My Nephew is 3 years old."
1,"Works good, got it at the best price. The capability to read at night is totally worth the money"
0,This tablet has little cpu power and is really only made to work with the Amazon Prime crowd. Not what I was looking for.
0,"Love this tablet, everything is excellent for the price except no google play store. I am not a fan of subpar apps, takes Amazon's outdated Facebook app. Accept Google Play and I will rate 5 stars."
1,"This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
1,"Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy"
1,We bought this for our two year old grandchild he loves it we set up a screen name for him and he plays on it every night! He has dropped it several times and it's fine nothing at all wrong with it!! Very durable!
1,"Great fun...still experimenting with requests...music, etc."
1,"Bought as a gift for my mother in law for Christmas, and was happy to hear that her husband got Alexa to play ""Revelry"" at volume 10 to wake her up in the morning. Easy to use and great sound quality for listening to music. Helpful with definitions and spelling of words."
1,"Perfect, thanks."
1,I bought this and the dot when shopping after Christmas. A spur of the moment decision. It is so much fun. And every day there is something new! We love it.
1,Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
1,"Overall I am very pleased with my paperwhite. Small and compact, fits in my purse, lightweight, and easy to read with the backlight."
1,First of all I would like to say that I'm very happy with my purchase. It is very helpful and useful gadgets for every single ebook reader. Battery life is awesome and it's very stylish display and overall look. Definitely must buy product.
1,I picked up this tablet primarily so my husband could access his favorite apps while at home without having to squint at a phone screen. Works great.
1,i ENJOYED HOW IT TELLS ME MY CALENDARSCHEDULE AND PLAYS MUSIC FROM MY LIBRARY OF MANY SOURCES.CHECKING TRAFFIC TO MY OFFICE AND HAVING ALEXA READ TO ME ADDED JOYS.
1,"Overall this seems to be a good tablet, but I wish it used the Google Play store as well as the Amazon apps, because I can't get the Target Cartwheel without paying."
1,Great product can you add Lotta different things continually learning
1,It is so easy to set up. Like to ask a question and get The answer. The best gift ever.
1,Easy to read even in bright sunshine. Simple to set-up and use. Long battery life.
1,Great for outdoors while seating in the sun reading
1,"Can't beat the price on this tablet. It greatly serves its purpose, I bought it for my kids to read. They love it!"
1,"We use our Echo for music, scheduling, tv commands, controlling the thermostat, basic information and various other tasks. Good way to simplify your life - these gadgets are great."
1,Absolutely love the amazon fire tv. I got this because it was one of the few streaming services that was compatible with DIRECTV Now. And it has not disappointed! Runs super fast! It only buffered every once and awhile. But Bot enough to cause an issue.
1,Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
0,gave to daughter and son. they are enjoying them very much
1,Bought this for my mom and she just loves it. Uses it for reading mostly.
1,It takes some practice to use all the functions of the echo. Additional components are expensive but all in all worth it.
1,"I needed a tablet to play games, watch movies and so on while traveling. I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This tablet meets my expectations."
1,We bought 3 of these for our grandkids as Christmas gifts. These are just the right size Tablets for them.

0,I like the Kindle Fire. I use it to access my movies and apps. I use it for my gaming apps.

1,Fire tv good for streaming install kodi and get free movies
1,"Saw quite a few youtube videos on this product and thought it would be fun to have. We have it downstairs in a split level house and keep it downstairs. We should probably buy another one to keep upstairs! Works great. Voice recognition is superb. We use it to check traffic, play Pandora stations and answer various questions. Don't have any home automation stuff yet, but that may be next!"

1,Great tablet and perfect for the kids. I will be going back to buy more of these at this price!
0,"I was excited to purchase the Amazon Echo, but when I thought that I could carry it out on the beach I was a little disappointed. If it had the capabilities to have a battery life to use without being plugged up it would be excellent."
1,I bought this for my mom and it's great. I have a fire and I love reading on it so I knew she would to.
1,"The amazon echo is great. She knows and understands majority of commands. I haven't used that much, but from what I have seen... so far so good. Got it on sale xmas season!"

1,very practical product if you read ebooks. thin and light.
1,I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts. Great gifts
1,I purchased this as a gift for my father and he has absolutely enjoyed having it!!! It was indeed a good purchase!!!
1,"Since moving to the Fire TV, haven't missed DirecTV!! This a great product loaded with features that is very easy to use."
1,"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
1,"I got this to basically experiment with. Straight out of the box, it's really not that impressive. It's a ""novelty"", however, as I checked out the skills available, lights started coming on - Literally! Echo's ability to integrate with Home Automation is excellent! Having voice commands for turning on/off lights may seem like a novelty as well, however, there are endless options for the elderly, or disabled with this little assistant, and some customizing."
1,Great table. Great price i recomend this product im very happy
1,I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need
1,"Speaker blew me away, it gets so loud giving commands is hard"
1,I wasn't sure I could prefer digital books over traditional but I love this reader. Pages are clear and easy to navigate. One of the best purchases I ever made.
1,"This thing does so many things it's incredible. Time saver, information finder , and even a family entertainer!"
1,"This device is great for the home. It plays thousands of songs, provides current news, answers all sorts of questions. Great for my kids to get answers on any subject."
1,Great product for kids . Handy for travel purpose.
1,Bought as a gift for my 70-year-old husband who reads a lot. He loves this way of reading books only accessible by Kindle.
1,Kids love it comes with a case but purchased one anyway
1,Works great.
1,Love everything about the echo. Best AI speaker for its price
1,Very excited to try this and so far so good !!!!!!
1,Alexa is exactly what I expected it to be! Best Father's Day gift.
0,Thought this would be pretty cool gadget. Not impressed. Poor voice recognition.
1,"Great streaming device, easy to set up, I love it."
1,"The kindle was great, however the cover does not fitThat is my fault, must have ordered the wrong one. To expense to return.Service was great and can't say enough about the Prime. Even delivered on Sunday! Now that's service."
1,Great sound quality from such a small item. Easy to hide so it's not noticeable.
1,"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
1,"My son who is eight loves this tablet. Great for road trips and really works for the price. Hey let's be honest kids need something to keep them busy, this works fast, easy to start up."
0,"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
1,"I was a bit uncertain on whether or not we would actually use this enough to warrant the purchase. After having it for two weeks I can definitively state that we do. It's such a great speaker that doesn't require linking to a phone, and that makes me listen to music far more often. The assistant features are also quite nice. Overall, very worth buying and keeping in your main room."
1,"This is our 2nd Echo. My husband had to have his own for his use outside by the pool so when he wanted to find out something, he could just ask Alexa and find the answer all while laying in the pool and watching tv. Such a fun thing to have around and ask questions to."
1,The backlight is the best part of this Kindle! I highly recommend doing the paperwhite!
1,Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
1,She has no idea that this item has limitations and was thrilled to receive a tablet with a camera. She seems to be entrenched in it 24/7 so it must be working.
1,"Had several fire sticks and thought let's try this. Got it in sale, it just so fast. Would recommend for sure!"
1,It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
1,"Works faster than the Blu ray Dvd/streaming combo like Sony or Samsung those were very slow streaming devices. I'm only on 3MBPS & the amazon Fire is a solid steaming device. I use Amazon video, Netflix, Pureflix,YouTube I've also seen a live event that streamed really good. Very impressed compared to the blu ray combo but it has its place but not for streaming anymore. Well done amazon and thanks to Best Buy ."
1,"syncing issue, but once resolved alexa works fine! becareful not to say alexa or echo too loud if you don't want her to answer. make sure your question is clear. the response is immediate- it is amazing and freaky! now we really don't have to recall anything because we can ask alexa."
1,"My nephew always wanted to play games on my phone, so when I saw this tablet on sale I picked it up thinking it would make him happy to have his own tablet to play games. For past month, I have not seen him once with out it. Big score for favorite Aunt.."
1,I got it for my daughter to use for entertainment and she uses it everyday
1,I love Alexa. I can control my thermostat and all my light switches with her. This product is definitely worth the money.
1,We got both our boys ages 7 and 9 one for Christmas they both picked up how to use it quickly. They both love them and couldn't be happier. Great alternative to a laptop for children.
1,"My son enjoys this tablet, it works well but for his next one we will get a larger screen size. Overall great value and well worth the price."
1,"Having so much fun with my Echo. It is full of things to do once you get used to how to ask it. You have to say the name of the skill before you can ask a question. Once you get the hang of it, it is great. There is still so much more that it can do that I haven't yet discovered. You won't regret this purchase."
1,Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
1,"So I have now purchased two Amazon Echos from Best Buy. I have one upstairs and one down stairs. My main reason for the purchase was for home automation. I have previously installed several WEMO switches and bulbs in the house and wanted to take advantage of Alexa's ability to control them. Works really well, however I didn't realize she can't control the WEMO bulbs. Hopefully this is something that will come soon. I ask her about the weather, add items to my shopping list, set reminders, listen to music, and use the alarm function to wake me up. So far it's a great buy. Totally recommend this."
1,"This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use."
1,"My kids love the Amazon fire.Great for all ages, love parent control option. Great for every day on the go use. From movies,games , reading, and even to keep track of emails and friends. :0)"
1,"I used to avoid dragging along books/magazines to read as they are bulky and heavy, but now I don't need to. I just download my reading material."
1,"My wife has had one for quite a bit and she was always telling me this was the way to go. No matter how low I put the brightness on my phone, it was still a very harsh light. I can easily set the brightness to a comfortable level, still use it in any light, and I find I fall asleep faster at night side it is easy in the eyes."
1,Our granddaughter wanted a tablet for Christmas so we got her one of these. My sister and sister-in-law have one and love it
1,Perfect tablet for kids. Easy to use and a great size
0,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
1,Works well. Lots of advertising. Minecraft works great and other video games.
1,It is doing what's it was advertised to do.i t working still
1,Purchased as a replacement for a Kindle and it functions well as a Kindle and a tablet.
1,This Kindle Fire tablet was a Christmas gift. The recipient is over joyed thus far.
1,"I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
1,"It was for my daughter for Christmas. She love it, I'm happy"
1,Purchased as gift for my wife. She loves it. Display is very crisp and easy to read
1,"bought several of these again this year for the family as stocking stuffers, best buy had them on sale for $33 ea I can't really dis this tablet it works as intended and keeps the kids entertained. only real con is that you can't cast netflix or youtube. it will only cast Amazon related services, but I have heard that there is a workaround to get it to work. Amazon please release casting features for all services not just yours."
1,handy
1,I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there
1,Originally bought TV Stick and ran into a few issues. Returned for Fire TV and I am not disappointed at all.

1,Tablet is easy to work with only can be slow to come up on certain sites
1,Easy to use many different features make it fun to use
1,Love the features and easy to set up and use.... would recommend !!!
1,"IAlexa is a good tool to get families together. We gathered around to take turns asking questions. it pushes the voice recognition software because there are more than one voices to ""learn"" from. Poor on written instructions but online feedback is very responsive and helpful."
1,I am still learning about my Amazon Fire tablet. It was easy for my to download books I wanted. I think I am going to really like it once I have learned more about it.
1,"Bought for my daughter as an upgrade from her last one, and she loves it!!! I also bought another for her sister and both girls can navigate everything really easy."
1,Bought for my 8 year old - good price and does what she likes
1,This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
0,This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.
1,"This product is very user friendly, easy to use. The remote is clean and simple in design."
1,"You can't beat what you get out of this tablet for the money. Easy to download play store and install actual apps.PROS: Price, ease of use, expandable storage, battery life.CONS: screen resolution, low RAM, not for high powered games."

1,Great for the money spent. Yeah sure you can spend a lot more for it tablet.

1,My kids love their new tablets they use them for homework and at school
1,"I bought this, to replace my son's old Kindle Fire. It has lived up to its potential so far."
1,Alexa can be annoying sometimes when doesn't respond to your commands or doesn't know the answer or answers from the tv. But I still love it I have two of them.
1,My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
0,"I'm constantly getting updates on how they are making the echo great. It will take time, but needs to also integrate with phone to send and receive calls and text messages. Hate having to tell it what 3rd part app to integrate with also. Good for smarthome features."
1,"I have been using the Amazon Echo for a few weeks now, I have to say its much more responsive then the Google Home when using home automation. A must have for any home."
0,"Compared to an equally inexpensive RCA tablet, this one has more limitations in the apps you can get. I was disappointed in its utility and prefer the RCA tablet over this one."
1,I have several of the fire sticks. This is faster and works better than the fire stick.
1,I like to read in bed and find the Kindle so light that I can read much longer without getting tired of holding it.
1,even looks up phone numbers of near by places not in my contacts list!
0,"I was tokd if you had wfi there would be no problem to make it work. Wrong, I already gave it to the person and they cannot make it work, they do not have a smart phone, but have computer and wifi... Im afraid I will have to return the item."
1,"Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money."
1,Easy to use and great picture. Alexa voice control is good.
1,Is table is good no to fast but work good. Nice picture.
1,"This is much better than the fire tv, but also a little bit more expensive. It's worth it."
1,One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
1,If you don't have a tablet or your kid doesn't this is a great option. Durable and an excellent value.
1,Love this tablet! This is my second. Just couldn't beat the price!!
1,Our youngest grandson loves his kindle fire. He loves reading his books and playing Minecraft as well as other games. A great started tablet!
1,"Makes a great smart home addition as it links to smart thermostats, lights, etc. Very informative and the different add ons are amazing! Highly recommended."
1,Initially was purchasing this for my 2 yr old nephew but after I received it I could not part with it and bought him another cheaper brand.
1,"So happy with this Kindle! It's very easy to use, lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book, except here you have an entire library with you."
1,Its a great technology to have at home for news and entertainment
1,Great little tablet for the price. Got on sale at Best Buy for $30 on Black Friday.
1,"Best Christmas gift ever! The kids enjoy listening to their music, asking Alexia for jokes and I like the fact that it gives us the weather and movie times for a local theater."
1,This is a great product. Suitable for all ages. I love using this because of the I find something new everytime I use this. I would grade this an a plus.
1,"This is my 2 nd Echo purchase. I have had one for awhile. This was for my daughter. We love Alexa. She is in our kitchens and helps with everything; recipes, kid chore list, grocery list, music, weather, timer, story teller, the list is endless. She gets confused occasionally but she is usually still amusing. We are all glad she became part of our family."
1,Me and the kids love it very user friendly and a fair price
1,For the money this tablet can't be beat. great for kids or adults who aren't looking for a powerful tablet.
1,Really is just as good as the commercials make it out to be
1,Easy to view in all light levels. Easy interface and loading of books is fast.
1,The Kindle is the best E Reader on the market. Bright screen and great selection of books
1,There are a few things that needs correcting but overall I love it.
1,The quality is awesome for the price. Amazon products are always cool.
1,Works well with kindle
0,The only bad thing I can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet completely off in order to get to the main screen.
1,Product is great. Plenty storage for lots of books
1,Fire tablets most most awesome with lots of good images
1,this is a great tablet at a great price. it is very user friendly.
1,"I purchased this Kindle to replace my original Kindle that is of the same format. I don't believe it was called Paperwhite, but its the one without the keyboard at the bottom. It has been a great Kindle, however, I've always been disappointed that it did not have a back light. Now that I have a back light, I have no idea how I managed before. Even reading before bed with the lamp next to the bed on, the back light makes a big difference. The extra resolution is nice, but not really a huge thing when you're talking about text on the screen. The battery life is definitely reduced when running the back light, however, not to the point where I have to charge every night. I'll still likely get several weeks of battery life before needing to recharge. Overall, if you're looking to upgrade, this is the Kindle to get. The back light is a huge upgrade for me. It helps reduce my eye strain which is important to me."
1,What more can be said about the Echo? It is a quality device that works exactly as advertised.
1,"I know it is entirely a personally bias, but I love Kindles and this is one of the best Kindles ever."
1,I integrate Alexa to my control4 animation system and afte program few command I lover her even more
1,"Very useful for those who purchase many titles, who travel frequently, or who just are seeking to save money on buying books."
1,"As I stated before, excellent gift for the grandkids."
1,This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.
1,My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
1,"I bought this for my mom. It works perfectly for Facebook, games and email."
1,Kindle is always the first choice to read the E-book. Comfortable reading experience.
1,"I really get the most of my Amazon Prime Video now. I find it is easy and responsive to use. The main pain is having to change the Input so you have to use three controllers, the media controller, the cable controller and the original TV controller. Fortunately I'm used to that with my Apple TV. It is less fussy than the Apple TV especially when you view Amazon content. Well it naturally would be because the content is automatically there."
1,Bought this for my son for Christmas. He broke his tablet last year. Hopefully this one will last longer.
1,The tablet is really good for the price. Great deal.
1,Works like a charm! We love having the option of regular tv or not!
1,"I have the Roku 4, and new Apple TV, this streaming box is just a good as them. I only got it because I have Amazon Prime (even though you can get eh Amazon Video app for Roku), I wanted the complete experience."
0,"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
1,"Gave as a Christmas gift, she loves it. Did have to pay to ship it though."
1,I loved this tablet Has games and is super fast. Great tablet
1,Bought for my K classroom!! Great price for student use!!
1,Easy-to-use experience and the things I've able to do over my old kindle
1,Bought for my eight year old. She absolutely loves it!
1,"I bought this intending to use it as a music and video player, so I can save battery for my phone. We got two, one for me one for my child. Mine works perfectly for what I bought it. All my music is on it with no problem. I did have to download an app to play my WMA files, but that was simple enough. My child's tablet is primarily used for app games, and I am told it is working just fine."
1,"Great for kids, bought both colors for two of my kids."
