this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money.
